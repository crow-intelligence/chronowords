fellow citizens of the senate and the house of representatives

 among the vicissitude incident to life no event could have fill i with great anxiety than that of which the notification be transmit by your order and receive on the fourteenth day of the present month on the one hand i be summon by my country whose voice i can never hear but with veneration and love from a retreat which i have choose with the fond predilection and in my flattering hope with an immutable decision as the asylum of my decline year a retreat which be render every day more necessary as well as more dear to i by the addition of habit to inclination and of frequent interruption in my health to the gradual waste commit on it by time on the other hand the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country call i be sufficient to awaken in the wise and most experienced of her citizen a distrustful scrutiny into his qualification could not but overwhelm with dispondence one who inherit inferior endowment from nature and unpractise in the duty of civil administration ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficencie in this conflict of emotion all i dare aver be that it have be my faithful study to collect my duty from a just appreciation of every circumstance by which it might be affect all i dare hope be that if in execute this task i have be too much sway by a grateful remembrance of former instance or by an affectionate sensibility to this transcendent proof of the confidence of my fellow citizen and have thence too little consult my incapacity as well as disinclination for the weighty and untried care before i my error will be palliate by the motive which mislead i and its consequence be judge by my country with some share of the partiality in which they originate

 such be the impression under which i have in obedience to the public summon repair to the present station it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official act my fervent supplication to that almighty be who rule over the universe who preside in the councils of nations and whose providential aid can supply every human defect that his benediction may consecrate to the liberty and happiness of the people of the united states a government institute by themselves for these essential purpose and may enable every instrument employ in its administration to execute with success the function allot to his charge in tender this homage to the great author of every public and private good i assure myself that it express your sentiment not less than my own nor those of my fellow citizen at large less than either no people can be bind to acknowledge and adore the invisible hand which conduct the affairs of man more than the people of the united states every step by which they have advance to the character of an independent nation seem to have be distinguish by some token of providential agency and in the important revolution just accomplish in the system of their united government the tranquil deliberation and voluntary consent of so many distinct community from which the event have result can not be compare with the mean by which most government have be establish without some return of pious gratitude along with an humble anticipation of the future blessing which the past seem to presage these reflection arise out of the present crisis have force themselves too strongly on my mind to be suppress you will join with i i trust in thinking that there be none under the influence of which the proceeding of a new and free government can more auspiciously commence

 by the article establish the executive department it be make the duty of the president to recommend to your consideration such measure as he shall judge necessary and expedient the circumstance under which i now meet you will acquit i from enter into that subject far than to refer to the great constitutional charter under which you be assemble and which in define your power designate the object to which your attention be to be give it will be more consistent with those circumstance and far more congenial with the feeling which actuate i to substitute in place of a recommendation of particular measure the tribute that be due to the talent the rectitude and the patriotism which adorn the character select to devise and adopt they in these honorable qualification i behold the sure pledge that as on one side no local prejudice or attachment no seperate view nor party animosity will misdirect the comprehensive and equal eye which ought to watch over this great assemblage of community and interest so on another that the foundation of our national policy will be lay in the pure and immutable principle of private morality and the pre eminence of a free government be exemplify by all the attribute which can win the affection of its citizens and command the respect of the world

 i dwell on this prospect with every satisfaction which an ardent love for my country can inspire since there be no truth more thoroughly establish than that there exist in the oeconomy and course of nature an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness between duty and advantage between the genuine maxim of an honest and magnanimous policy and the solid reward of public prosperity and felicity since we ought to be no less persuade that the propitious smile of heaven can never be expect on a nation that disregard the eternal rule of order and right which heaven itself have ordain and since the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government be justly consider as deeply perhaps as finally stake on the experiment entrust to the hand of the american people

 besides the ordinary object submit to your care it will remain with your judgment to decide how far an exercise of the occasional power delegate by the fifth article of the constitution be render expedient at the present juncture by the nature of objection which have be urge against the system or by the degree of inquietude which have give birth to they instead of undertake particular recommendation on this subject in which i could be guide by no light derive from official opportunity i shall again give way to my entire confidence in your discernment and pursuit of the public good for i assure myself that whilst you carefully avoid every alteration which might endanger the benefit of an united and effective government or which ought to await the future lesson of experience a reverence for the characteristic right of freeman and a regard for the public harmony will sufficiently influence your deliberation on the question how far the former can be more impregnably fortify or the latter be safely and advantageously promote

 to the preceede observation i have one to add which will be most properly address to the house of representatives it concern myself and will therefore be as brief as possible when i be first honour with a call into the service of my country then on the eve of an arduous struggle for its liberty the light in which i contemplate my duty require that i should renounce every pecuniary compensation from this resolution i have in no instance depart and be still under the impression which produce it i must decline as inapplicable to myself any share in the personal emolument which may be indispensably include in a permanent provision for the executive department and must accordingly pray that the pecuniary estimate for the station in which i be place may during my continuance in it be limit to such actual expenditure as the public good may be think to require

 having thus impart to you my sentiment as they have be awaken by the occasion which bring we together i shall take my present leave but not without resort once more to the benign parent of the human race in humble supplication that since he have be pleased to favour the american people with opportunity for deliberate in perfect tranquility and disposition for decide with unparellelled unanimity on a form of government for the security of their union and the advancement of their happiness so his divine blessing may be equally conspicuous in the enlarge view the temperate consultation and the wise measure on which the success of this government must depend

and be    embolden by the impunity of their crime and aid by such part of the neighboring    tribe as could be seduce to join in their hostility or afford they a retreat    for their prisoner and plunder they have instead of listen to the humane    overtures92 make on the part of the united states renew their violence with    fresh alacrity and great effect the life of a number of valuable citizens    have thus be sacrifice and some of they under circumstance peculiarly shocking    whilst other have be carry into a deplorable captivity    these aggravate provocation render it essential to the safety of the western    settlement that the aggressor should be make sensible that the government    of the union be not less capable of punish their crime than it be dispose    to respect their right and reward their attachment as this object could not    be effect by defensive measure it become necessary to put in force the act    which empower the president to call out the militia for the protection of the    frontier and i have accordingly authorize an expedition in which the regular    troop in that quarter be combine with such draft of militia as be deem    sufficient the

stipulate in certain case the aid of the national authority to his consuls    establish here some legislative provision be requisite to carry these stipulation    into full effect   the establishment

interest of the debt fund but as far and as fast as the grow resource    of the country will permit to exonerate it of the principal itself the appropriation    you have make of the western lands explain your disposition on this subject    and i be persuade the soon that valuable fund can be make to contribute along    with other mean to the actual reduction of the public debt the more

that the labour of the    present45 session which have just commence will under the guidance of a spirit    no less prudent than patriotic issue in measure conducive to the stability    and increase of national prosperity    numerous as be the providential blessing which demand our grateful acknowledgment    the abundance with which another year have again reward the industry of the    husbandman be too important to escape recollection   your own observation in your respective situation will have satisfy    you of the progressive state of agriculture manufactures commerce and navigation    in trace their cause you will have remark with particular pleasure the    happy effect of that revival of confidence public as well as private to which    the constitution and laws of the united states have so eminently contribute    and you will have observe with no less interest new and decisive proof of    the increase reputation and credit of the nation but you nevertheless can not    fail to derive satisfaction from the confirmation of these circumstance which    will be disclose in the several official communication that will be make    to you in the course of your deliberation   the rapid subscription to the bank of the united states which complete    the sum allow to be subscribe in a single day be among the striking and    pleasing evidence which present themselves not only of confidence in the government    but of resource in the community   in the interval of your recess due attention have be pay to the execution    of the different object which be specially provide for by the law and resolutions    of the last session   among the most important of these be the defence and security of the western    frontiers to accomplish it on the most humane principle be a primary wish   accordingly at the same time that treaty have be provisionally conclude    and other proper mean use to attach the wavering and to confirm in their    friendship the well dispose tribe of indians effectual measure have be    adopt to make those of a hostile description sensible that a pacification    be desire upon term of moderation and justice   these measure having prove unsuccessful it become necessary to convince    the refractory of the power of the united states to punish their depredation    offensive operation have therefore be direct to be conduct however    as consistently as possible with the dictate of humanity some of these have    be crown with full success and other be yet depend the expedition    which have be complete be carry on under the authority and at the expense    of the united states by the militia of kentucke whose enterprise intripidity    and good conduct be entitle to peculiar commendation   overture of peace be still continue to the delude tribe and considerable    number of individual belong to they have lately renounce all further    opposition remove from their former situation and place themselves under    the immediate protection of the united states   it be sincerely to be desire that all need of coercion in future may cease    and that an intimate intercourse may succeed calculate to advance the happiness    of the indians and to attach they firmly to the united states   in order to this it seem necessary that they should experience the benefit    of an impartial administration 46 of justice that the mode of alienate their    land the main source of discontent and war should be so define and regulate    as to obviate imposition and as far as may be practicable controversy concern    the reality and extent of the alienation which be make that commerce with    they should be promote under regulation tend to secure an equitable deportment    towards they and that such rational experiment should be make for impart    to they the blessing of civilization as may from time to time suit their    condition that the executive of the united states should be enable to employ    the mean to which the indians have be long accustomed for unite their immediate    interests with the preservation of peace and that efficatious provision should    be make for inflict adequate penalty upon all those who by violate their    right shall infringe the treaty and endanger the peace of the union    a system corrisponding with the mild principle of religion and philanthropy    towards an unenlightened race of men whose happiness materially depend on    the conduct of the united states would be as honorable to the national character    as conformable to the dictate of sound policy   the power specially vest in i by the act lay certain duty on distilled    spirit which respect the subdivision of the district into surveys the appointment    of officer and the assignment of compensation have likewise be carry    into effect in a matter in which both material and experience be want    to guide the calculation it will be readily conceive that there must have    be difficulty in such an adjustment of the rate of compensation as would    conciliate a reasonable competency with a proper regard to the limit prescribe    by the law it be hope that the circumspection which have be use will be    find

measures a provision for the sale of the vacant land of the united states   the first be certainly an object of primary importance whether view in    reference to the national security to the satisfaction of the community or    to the preservation of order in connection with this the establishment of    competent magazines and arsenals and the fortification of such place as be    peculiarly important and vulnerable naturally present themselves to consideration    the safety of the united states under divine protection ought to rest on the    basis of systematic and solid arrangement expose as little as possible to    the hazard of fortuitous circumstance   the importance of the post office and post roads on a plan sufficiently liberal    and comprehensive as they respect the expedition safety and facility of communication    be increase by the instrumentality in diffuse a knowledge of the law and    proceeding of the government which while it contribute to the security of    the people serve also to guard they against the effect of misrepresentation    and misconception the establishment of additional cros post especially to    some of the important point in the western and northern part of the union    can not fail to be of material utility   the disorder in the exist currency and especially the scarcity of small    change a scarcity so peculiarly distress to the poor class strongly    recommend the carrying into immediate effect the resolution already enter    into concern the establishment of a mint measure have be take pursuant    to that resolution for procure some of the most necessary artist together    with the requisite apparatus   an uniformity in the weight and measure of the country be among the important    object submit to you by the constitution and if it can be derive from    a standard at once invariable and universal must be no less honorable to the    public councils than conducive to the public convenience   a provision for the sale of the vacant land of the united states be particularly    urge among other reason by the important consideration that they be pledge    as a fund for reimburse the public debt that if timely and judiciously apply    they may save the necessity of burthen our citizen with new taxis for the    extinguishment of the principal and that be free to discharge the principal    but

  fellow citizen of the senate and of the house of representatives it be some abatement of the satisfaction with which i meet you on the present      occasion that in felicitate you on a continuance

will i be persuade learn with no less concern than i communicate it    that reiterate endeavor toward effect a pacification have hitherto issue    only in new and outrageous proof of persevere hostility on the part of the    tribe with whom we be in contest an earnest desire to procure tranquillity    to the frontier to stop the further effusion of blood to arrest the progress    of expense to forward the prevalent wish of the nation for peace have lead    through various channel to strenuous effort to accomplish these desirable    purpose in make which effort i consult less my own anticipation of    the event or the scruple which some consideration be calculate to inspire    than the wish to find the object attainable or if not attainable to ascertain    unequivocally that such be the case   a detail of the measure which have be pursue and of their consequence    which will be lay before you while it will confirm to you the want of success    thus far will i trust evince that mean as proper and as efficacious as could    have be devise have be employ the issue of some of they indeed be    still depend but a favourable one though not to be despair of be not    promise by anything that have yet happen   in the course of the attempt which have be make some valuable citizen    have fall victim to their zeal for the public service a sanction commonly    respect even among savage have be find in this instance insufficient    to protect from massacre the emissary of peace it will i presume be duly    consider whether the occasion do not call for an exercise of liberality    towards the family of the deceased   it must add to your concern to be inform that besides the continuation    of hostile appearance among the tribe north of the ohio some threaten    symptom have of late be revive among some of those south of it   a part of the cherokees know by the name of chickamagas inhabitate five    village on the tennesee river have be long in the practice of commit    depredation on the neighbouring settlement   it be hope that the treaty of holstin make with the cherokee nation in    july 1791 would have prevent a repetition of such depredation but the event    have not answer this hope the chickamagas aid by some banditti of another    tribe in their vicinity have recently perpetrate wanton and unprovoked hostility    upon the citizens of the united states in that quarter the information which    have be receive on this subject will be lay before you hitherto defensive    precaution only have be strictly enjoin and observe   it be not understand that any breach of treaty or aggression whatsoever    on the part of the united states or their citizens be even allege as a pretext    for the spirit of hostility in this quarter   i have reason to believe that every practicable exertion have be make pursuant    to the provision by law for that purpose to be prepare for the alternative    of a prosecution of the war in the event of a failure of pacific overture    a large proportion of the troop authorize to be raise have be recruit    though the number be still incomplete and pain have be take to discipline    and put they in condition for the particular kind of service to be perform    a delay of operation besides be dictate by the measure which be pursue    towards a pacific termination of the war have be in itself deem preferable    to immature effort a statement from the proper department with regard to the    number of troop raise and some other point which have be suggest will    afford more precise information as a guide to the legislative consultation    and among other thing will enable congress to judge whether some additional    stimulus to the recruiting service may not be adviseable   in look forward to the future expense of the operation which may be find    inevitable i derive consolation from the information i receive that the product    of the revenue for the present year be likely to supersede the necessity of    additional burthen on the community for the service of the ensue year this    however will be well ascertain in the course of the session and it be    proper to add that the information allude to proceed upon the supposition    of no material extension of the spirit of hostility   i can not dismiss the subject of indian affair without again recommend    to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for give energy    to the law throughout our interior frontier and for restrain the commission    of outrage upon the indians without which all pacific plan must prove nugatory    to enable by competent reward the employment of qualified and trusty person    to reside among they as agent would also contribute to the preservation of    peace and good neighbourhood if in addition to these expedient an eligible    plan could be devise for promote civilization among the friendly tribe    and for carry on trade with they upon a scale equal to their want and    under regulation calculate to protect they from imposition and extortion    its influence in cement their interest with our 's could not but be considerable   the prosperous state of our revenue have be intimate this would be still    more the case be it not for the impediment which in some place continue    to embarrass the collection of the duty on spirit distil within the united    states these impediment have lessen and be lessen in local extent    and as apply to the community at large the contentment with the law appear    to be progressive   but symptom of increase opposition having lately manifest themselves in    certain quarter i judge a special interposition on my part proper and adviseable    and under this impression have issue a proclamation warn against all unlawful    combination and proceeding have for their object or tend to obstruct    the operation of the law in question and announce that all lawful way and    mean would be strictly put in execution for bring to justice the infractor    thereof and secure obedience thereto   measure have also be take for the prosecution of offender and congress    may be assure that nothing within constitutional and legal limit which may    depend on i shall be want to assert and maintain the just authority of    the law in fulfil this trust i shall count intirely upon the full cooperation    of the other department of government and upon the zealous support of all    good citizens   i can not forbear to bring again into the view of the legislature the subject    of a revision of the judiciary system a representation from the judges of the    supreme court which will be lay before you point out some of the inconvenience    that be experience in the course of the execution of the

find worthy of particular    attention   observation on the value of peace with other nation be unnecessary it    would be wise however by timely provision to guard against those act of    our own citizens which might tend to disturb it and to put ourselves in a    condition to give that satisfaction to foreign nations which we may sometimes    have occasion to require from they i particularly recommend to your consideration    the mean of prevent those aggression by our citizens on the territory of    other nation and other infraction of the law of nations which furnish    just subject of

too closely interweave with many affect    consideration to be lightly adopt i postpone therefore the summoning    of the militia immediately into the field but i require they to be hold in    readiness that if my anxious endeavour to reclaim the deluded and to convince    the malignant of their danger should be fruitless military force might be    prepare to act before the season should be too far advanced   my proclamation of the 7th of august last be accordingly issue and accompany    by the appointment of commissioners who be charge to repair to the scene    of insurrection they be

sufficiently general nor conclusive    to recommend or warrant a further suspension of the march of the militia   thus the painful alternative could not be discard i order the militia    to march after once more admonish the insurgent in my proclamation of    the 25th of september last   it be a task too difficult to ascertain with precision the low degree    of force competent to the quelling of the insurrection from a respect indeed    to oeconomy and the ease of my fellow citizen belong to the militia it    would have gratify i to accomplish such an estimate my very reluctance to    ascribe too much importance to the opposition have its extent be accurately    see would have be a decide inducement to the small efficient number    in this uncertainty therefore i put in motion fifteen thousand man as be    an army which accord to all human calculation would be prompt and adequate    in every view and might perhaps by render resistance desperate prevent    the effusion of

as have not embrace the proffered term of amnesty and may be deem fit object    of example that the friend to peace and good government be not in need of    that aid and countenance which they ought

intelligence have tend to manifest the necessity of what have be do it    be now confess by those who be not inclined to exaggerate the ill conduct    of the insurgent that their malevolence be not

of mischief and revenge may not be lay aside    the stationing of a small force for a certain period in the four western county    of pennsylvania will be indispensable whether we contemplate the

their fidelity in the discharge    of their function sustain material injury to their property the obligation    and policy of indemnify they be strong and obvious it may also merit attention    whether policy will not enlarge this provision to the retribution of other citizen    who though not under the tie of office may have suffer damage by their    generous exertion for uphold the constitution and the law the amount    even if all the injure be include would not be great and on future emergency    the government would be amply repay by the influence of an example that he    who

 this interesting summary of our affair with regard to the foreign power between whom and the united states controversy have subsist and with regard also to those of our indian neighbor with whom we have be in a state of enmity or misunderstanding open a wide field for console and gratifying reflection if by prudence and moderation on every side the extinguishment of all the cause of external discord which have heretofore menace our tranquillity on term compatible with our national right and honor shall be the happy result how firm and how precious a foundation will have be lay for accelerate mature and establish the prosperity of our country
 contemplate the internal situation as well as the external relation of the united states we discover equal cause for contentment and satisfaction while many of the nation of europe with their american dependency have be involve in a contest unusually bloody exhausting and calamitous in which the evil of foreign war have be aggravate by domestic convulsion and insurrection in which many of the art most useful to society have be expose to discouragement and decay in which scarcity of subsistence have imbittere other suffering while even the anticipation of a return of the blessing of peace and repose be alloy by the sense of heavy and accumulate burthen which press upon all the department of industry and threaten to clog the future spring of government our favored country happy in a striking contrast have enjoy tranquillity&mdash;a tranquillity the more satisfactory because maintain at the expense of no duty faithful to ourselves we have violate no obligation to other
 our agriculture commerce and manufacture prosper beyond former example the molestation of our trade to prevent a continuance of which however very pointed remonstrance have be make be overbalance by the aggregate benefit which it derive from a neutral position our population advance with a celerity which exceed the most sanguine calculation proportionally augment our strength and resource and guarantee our future security
 every part of the union display indication of rapid and various improvement and with burthen so light as scarcely to be perceive with resource fully adequate to our present exigency with government found on the genuine principle of rational liberty and with mild and wholesome law be it too much to say that our country exhibit a spectacle of national happiness never surpass if ever before equal

 gentleman among the object which will claim your attention in the course of the session a review of our military establishment be not the least important it be call for by the event which have change and may be expect still far to change the relative situation of our frontier in this review you will doubtless allow due weight to the consideration that the question between we and certain foreign power be not yet finally adjust that the war in europe be not yet terminate and that our western post when recover will demand provision for garrison and secure they a statement of our present military force will be lay before you by the department of war
 with the review of our army establishment be naturally connect that of the militia it will merit inquiry what imperfection in the exist plan further experience may have unfold the subject be of so much moment in my estimation as to excite a constant solicitude that the consideration of it may be renew until the great attainable perfection shall be accomplish time be wear away some advantage for forward the object while none well deserve the persevere attention of the public council
 while we indulge the satisfaction which the actual condition of our western border so well authorizes it be necessary that we should not lose sight of an important truth which continually receive new confirmation namely that the provision heretofore make with a view to the protection of the indians from the violence of the lawless part of our frontier inhabitant be insufficient it be demonstrate that these violence can now be perpetrate with impunity and it can need no argument to prove that unless the murdering of indians can be restrain by bring the murderer to condign punishment all the exertion of the government to prevent destructive retaliation by the indians will prove fruitless and all our present agreeable prospect illusory the frequent destruction of innocent woman and child who be chiefly the victim of retaliation must continue to shock humanity and an enormous expense to drain the treasury of the union
 to enforce upon the indians the observance of justice it be indispensable that there shall be competent mean of render justice to they if these mean can be devise by the wisdom of congress and especially if there can be add an adequate provision for supply the necessity of the indians on reasonable term a measure the mention of which i the more readily repeat as in all the conference with they they urge it with solicitude i should not hesitate to entertain a strong hope of render our tranquillity permanent i add with pleasure that the probability even of their civilization be not diminish by the experiment which have be thus far make under the auspex of government the accomplishment of this work if practicable will reflect undecaye luster on our national character and administer the most grateful consolation that virtuous mind can know
 gentleman of the house of representatives
 the state of our revenue with the sum which have be borrow and reimburse pursuant to different act of congress will be submit from the proper department together with an estimate of the appropriation necessary to be make for the service of the ensue year
 whether measure may not be advisable to reinforce the provision of the redemption of the public debt will naturally engage your examination congress have demonstrate their sense to be and it be superfluous to repeat mine that whatsoever will tend to accelerate the honorable extinction of our public debt accord as much with the true interest of our country as with the general sense of our constituent
 gentleman of the senate and of the house of representatives
 the statement which will be lay before you relative to the mint will shew the situation of that institution and the necessity of some further legislative provision for carry the business of it more completely into effect and for check abuse which appear to be arise in particular quarter
 the progress in provide material for the frigate and in build they the state of the fortification of our harbor the measure which have be pursue for obtain proper site for arsenal and for replenish our magazine with military store and the step which have be take toward the execution of the law for open a trade with the indians will likewise be present for the information of congress
 temperate discussion of the important subject which may arise in the course of the session and mutual forbearance where there be a difference of opinion be too obvious and necessary for the peace happiness and welfare of our country to need any recommendation of mine
  gentleman of the house of representatives          with the utmost attention      i have consider your resolution of the 24th instant request i to lay      before your house a copy of the instruction to the minister of the united      states who negotiate the treaty with the king of great britain together with      the correspondence and other document relative to that treaty except such      of the say paper as any exist negotiation may render improper to be disclose           in deliberate upon this subject it be impossible for i to lose sight    of the principle which some have avow in its discussion or to avoid extend    my view to the consequence which must flow from the admission of that principle   i trust that no part of my conduct have ever indicate a disposition to withhold    any information which the constitution have enjoin upon the president as a    duty to give or which could be require of he by either house of congress    as a right and with truth i affirm that it have be as it will continue to    be while i have the honor to preside in the government my constant endeavour    to harmonize with the other branch thereof so far as the trust delegate    to i by the people of the united states and my sense of the obligation it    impose to quot;preserve protect and defend the constitution&quot will permit   the nature of foreign negotiation require caution and their success must    often depend on secrecy and even when bring to a conclusion a full disclosure    of all the measure demand or eventual concession which may have be propose    or contemplate would be extremely impolitic for this might have a pernicious    influence on future negotiation or produce immediate inconvenience perhaps    danger and mischief in relation to other power the necessity of such caution    and secrecy be one cogent reason for vest the power of make treaty in    the president with the advice and consent of the senate the principle on which    that body be form confine it to a small number of member   to admit then a right in the house of representatives to demand and to have    as a matter of course all the papers respect a negotiation with a foreign    power would be to establish a dangerous precedent   it do not occur that the inspection of the paper ask for be relative    to any purpose under the cognizance of the house of representatives except    that of an impeachment which the resolution have not express i repeat that    i have no disposition to withhold any information which the duty of my station    will permit or the public good shall require to be disclose and in fact    all the papers affect the negotiation with great britain be lay before    the senate when the treaty itself be communicate for their consideration    and advice   the course which the debate have take on the resolution of the house lead    to some observation on the mode of make treaty under the constitution of    the united states   having be a member of the general convention and know the principle    on which the constitution be form i have ever entertain but one opinion    on this subject and from the first establishment of the government to this    moment my conduct have exemplify that opinion that the power of make treaty    be exclusively vest in the president by and with the advice and consent of    the senate provide two third of the senators present concur and that every    treaty so make and promulgate thenceforward become the law of the land it    be thus that the treaty make power have be understand by foreign nations    and in all the treaty make with they we have declare and they have believe    that when ratify by the president with the advice and consent of the senate    they become obligatory in this construction of the constitution every house    of representatives have heretofore acquiesce and until the present time not    a doubt or suspicion have appear to my knowledge that this construction be    not the true one nay they have more than acquiesced for till now without    controvert the obligation of such treaty they have make all the requisite    provision for carry they into effect   there be also reason to believe that this construction agree with the opinion    entertain by the state conventions when they be deliberate on the constitution    especially by those who object to it because there be not require in commercial    treaty the consent of two third of the whole number of the member of the    senate instead of two third of the senator present and because in treaty    respect territorial and certain other right and claim the concurrence    of three fourth of the whole number of the member of both house respectively    be not make necessary   it be a fact declare by the general convention and universally understand    that the constitution of the united states be the result of a spirit of amity    and mutual concession and it be well know that under this influence the small    states be admit to an equal representation in the senate with the large    states and that this branch of the government be invest with great power    for on the equal participation of those power the sovereignty andpolitical    safety of the small states be deem essentially to depend   if other proof than these and the plain letter of the constitution itself    be necessary to ascertain the point under consideration they may be find in    the journal of the general convention which i have deposit in the office    of the department of state in these journal it will appear that a proposition    be make quot;that no treaty should be bind on the united states which    be not ratify by a law&quot and that the proposition be explicitly reject   as therefore it be perfectly clear to my understanding that file assent of    the house of representatives be not necessary to the validity of a treaty as    the treaty with great britain exhibit in itself all the object require legislative    provision and on these the paper call for can throw no light and as it    be essential to the due administration of the government that the boundary    fix by the constitution between the different department should be preserve    a just regard to the constitution and to the duty of my office under all the    circumstance of this case forbid a complyance with your request

 having be inform that some of your chief wish to see i in philadelphia i have send they word that i would receive a few of the most esteemed i now repeat that i shall be glad to see a small number of your wise chief but i shall not expect they 39;till november i shall take occasion to agree with they on the running of the boundary line between your land and our agreeably to the treaty of holston i shall expect they to inform i what chief be to attend the running of this line and i shall tell they whom i appoint to run it and the time and place of beginning may then be fix

 i now send my good wish to the cherokees and pray the great spirit to preserve they
the period for a new election of a citizen to administer the executive government of the united states be not far distant and the time actually arrive when your thought must be employ in designate the person who be to be clothe with that important trust it appear to i proper especially as it may conduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice that i should now apprise you of the resolution i have form to decline be consider among the number of those out of whom a choice be to be make

 i beg you at the same time to do i the justice to be assure that this resolution have not be take without a strict regard to all the consideration appertain to the relation which bind a dutiful citizen to his country and that in withdraw the tender of service which silence in my situation might imply i be influence by no diminution of zeal for your future interest no deficiency of grateful respect for your past kindness but be support by a full conviction that the step be compatible with both

 the acceptance of and continuance hitherto in the office to which your suffrage have twice call i have be a uniform sacrifice of inclination to the opinion of duty and to a deference for what appear to be your desire i constantly hope that it would have be much early in my power consistently with motive which i be not at liberty to disregard to return to that retirement from which i have be reluctantly draw the strength of my inclination to do this previous to the last election have even lead to the preparation of an address to declare it to you but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical posture of our affair with foreign nation and the unanimous advice of person entitle to my confidence impel i to abandon the idea i rejoice that the state of your concern external as well as internal no long render the pursuit of inclination incompatible with the sentiment of duty or propriety and be persuade whatever partiality may be retain for my service that in the present circumstance of our country you will not disapprove my determination to retire

 the impression with which i first undertake the arduous trust be explain on the proper occasion in the discharge of this trust i will only say that i have with good intention contribute toward the organization and administration of the government the good exertion of which a very fallible judgment be capable not unconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualification experience in my own eye perhaps still more in the eye of other have strengthen the motive to diffidence of myself and every day the increase weight of year admonish i more and more that the shade of retirement be as necessary to i as it will be welcome satisfy that if any circumstance have give peculiar value to my service they be temporary i have the consolation to believe that while choice and prudence invite i to quit the political scene patriotism do not forbid it

 in look forward to the moment which be intend to terminate the career of my political life my feeling do not permit i to suspend the deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which i owe to my beloved country for the many honor it have confer upon i still more for the steadfast confidence with which it have support i and for the opportunity i have thence enjoy of manifest my inviolable attachment by service faithful and persevere though in usefulness unequal to my zeal if benefit have result to our country from these service let it always be remember to your praise and as an instructive example in our annal that under circumstance in which the passion agitated in every direction be liable to mislead amidst appearance sometimes dubious vicissitude of fortune often discourage in situation in which not unfrequently want of success have countenance the spirit of criticism the constancy of your support be the essential prop of the effort and a guaranty of the plan by which they be effect profoundly penetrate with this idea i shall carry it with i to my grave as a strong incitement to uncease vow that heaven may continue to you the choice token of its beneficence that your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual that the free constitution which be the work of your hand may be sacredly maintain that its administration in every department may be stamp with wisdom and virtue that in fine the happiness of the people of these states under the auspex of liberty may be make complete by so careful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will acquire to they the glory of recommend it to the applause the affection and adoption of every nation which be yet a stranger to it

 here perhaps i ought to stop but a solicitude for your welfare which can not end but with my life and the apprehension of danger natural to that solicitude urge i on an occasion like the present to offer to your solemn contemplation and to recommend to your frequent review some sentiment which be the result of much reflection of no inconsiderable observation and which appear to i all important to the permanency of your felicity as a people these will be offer to you with the more freedom as you can only see in they the disinterested warning of a parting friend who can possibly have no personal motive to bias his counsel nor can i forget as an encouragement to it your indulgent reception of my sentiment on a former and not dissimilar occasion

 interwoven as be the love of liberty with every ligament of your heart no recommendation of mine be necessary to fortify or confirm the attachment

 the unity of government which constitute you one people be also now dear to you it be justly so for it be a main pillar in the edifice of your real independence the support of your tranquillity at home your peace abroad of your safety of your prosperity of that very liberty which you so highly prize but as it be easy to foresee that from different cause and from different quarter much pain will be take many artifice employ to weaken in your mind the conviction of this truth as this be the point in your political fortress against which the battery of internal and external enemy will be most constantly and actively though often covertly and insidiously direct it be of infinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of your national union to your collective and individual happiness that you should cherish a cordial habitual and immovable attachment to it accustom yourself to think and speak of it as of the palladium of your political safety and prosperity watch for its preservation with jealous anxiety discountenance whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandon and indignantly frown upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred tie which now link together the various part

 for this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest citizen by birth or choice of a common country that country have a right to concentrate your affection the name of american which belong to you in your national capacity must always exalt the just pride of patriotism more than any appellation derive from local discrimination with slight shade of difference you have the same religion manner habit and political principle you have in a common cause fight and triumph together the independence and liberty you possess be the work of joint council and joint effort of common danger suffering and success

 but these consideration however powerfully they address themselves to your sensibility be greatly outweigh by those which apply more immediately to your interest here every portion of our country find the most commanding motive for carefully guard and preserve the union of the whole

 the north in an unrestrained intercourse with the south protect by the equal law of a common government find in the production of the latter great additional resource of maritime and commercial enterprise and precious material of manufacturing industry the south in the same intercourse benefit by the same agency of the north see its agriculture grow and its commerce expand turn partly into its own channel the seaman of the north it find its particular navigation invigorate and while it contribute in different way to nourish and increase the general mass of the national navigation it look forward to the protection of a maritime strength to which itself be unequally adapt the east in a like intercourse with the west already find and in the progressive improvement of interior communication by land and water will more and more find a valuable vent for the commodity which it bring from abroad or manufacture at home the west derive from the east supply requisite to its growth and comfort and what be perhaps of still great consequence it must of necessity owe the secure enjoyment of indispensable outlet for its own production to the weight influence and the future maritime strength of the atlantic side of the union direct by an indissoluble community of interest as one nation any other tenure by which the west can hold this essential advantage whether derive from its own separate strength or from an apostate and unnatural connection with any foreign power must be intrinsically precarious

 while then every part of our country thus feel an immediate and particular interest in union all the part combine can not fail to find in the united mass of mean and effort great strength great resource proportionably great security from external danger a less frequent interruption of their peace by foreign nation and what be of inestimable value they must derive from union an exemption from those broil and war between themselves which so frequently afflict neighboring country not tie together by the same government which their own rivalship alone would be sufficient to produce but which opposite foreign alliance attachment and intrigue would stimulate and imbitter hence likewise they will avoid the necessity of those overgrown military establishment which under any form of government be inauspicious to liberty and which be to be regard as particularly hostile to republican liberty in this sense it be that your union ought to be consider as a main prop of your liberty and that the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the other

 these consideration speak a persuasive language to every reflect and virtuous mind and exhibit the continuance of the union as a primary object of patriotic desire be there a doubt whether a common government can embrace so large a sphere let experience solve it to listen to mere speculation in such a case be criminal we be authorize to hope that a proper organization of the whole with the auxiliary agency of government for the respective subdivision will afford a happy issue to the experiment it be well worth a fair and full experiment with such powerful and obvious motive to union affect all part of our country while experience shall not have demonstrate its impracticability there will always be reason to distrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to weaken its band

 in contemplate the cause which may disturb our union it occur as matter of serious concern that any ground should have be furnish for characterize party by geographical discrimination northern and southern atlantic and western-- whence design man may endeavor to excite a belief that there be a real difference of local interest and view one of the expedient of party to acquire influence within particular district be to misrepresent the opinion and aim of other district you can not shield yourselves too much against the jealousy and heartburning which spring from these misrepresentation they tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bind together by fraternal affection the inhabitant of our western country have lately have a useful lesson on this head they have see in the negotiation by the executive and in the unanimous ratification by the senate of the treaty with spain and in the universal satisfaction at that event throughout the united states a decisive proof how unfounded be the suspicion propagate among they of a policy in the general government and in the atlantic states unfriendly to their interest in regard to the mississippi they have be witness to the formation of two treaty that with great britain and that with spain which secure to they everything they could desire in respect to our foreign relation toward confirm their prosperity will it not be their wisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantage on the union by which they be procure will they not henceforth be deaf to those adviser if such there be who would sever they from their brother and connect they with alien

 to the efficacy and permanency of your union a government for the whole be indispensable no alliance however strict between the part can be an adequate substitute they must inevitably experience the infraction and interruption which all alliance in all time have experience sensible of this momentous truth you have improve upon your first essay by the adoption of a constitution of government well calculate than your former for an intimate union and for the efficacious management of your common concern this government the offspring of our own choice uninfluence and unawe adopt upon full investigation and mature deliberation completely free in its principle in the distribution of its power unite security with energy and contain within itself a provision for its own amendment have a just claim to your confidence and your support respect for its authority compliance with its law acquiescence in its measure be duty enjoin by the fundamental maxim of true liberty the basis of our political system be the right of the people to make and to alter their constitution of government but the constitution which at any time exist till change by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people be sacredly obligatory upon all the very idea of the power and the right of the people to establish government presuppose the duty of every individual to obey the establish government

 all obstruction to the execution of the law all combination and association under whatever plausible character with the real design to direct control counteract or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted authority be destructive of this fundamental principle and of fatal tendency they serve to organize faction to give it an artificial and extraordinary force to put in the place of the delegate will of the nation the will of a party often a small but artful and enterprise minority of the community and accord to the alternate triumph of different party to snake the public administration the mirror of the ill concert and incongruous project of faction rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plan digest by common counsel and modify by mutual interest

 however combination or association of the above description may now and then answer popular end they be likely in the course of time and thing to become potent engine by which cunning ambitious and unprincipled man will be enable to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the rein of government destroy afterwards the very engine which have lift they to unjust dominion

 toward the preservation of your government and the permanency of your present happy state it be requisite not only that you steadily discountenance irregular opposition to its acknowledge authority but also that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its principle however specious the pretext one method of assault may be to effect in the form of the constitution alteration which will impair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what can not be directly overthrow in all the change to which you may be invite remember that time and habit be at least as necessary to fix the true character of government as of other human institution that experience be the sure standard by which to test the real tendency of the exist constitution of a country that facility in change upon the credit of mere hypothesis and opinion expose to perpetual change from the endless variety of hypothesis and opinion and remember especially that for the efficient management of your common interest in a country so extensive as ours a government of as much vigor as be consistent with the perfect security of liberty be indispensable liberty itself will find in such a government with power properly distribute and adjust its sure guardian it be indeed little else than a name where the government be too feeble to withstand the enterprise of faction to confine each member of the society within the limit prescribe by the law and to maintain all in the secure and tranquil enjoyment of the right of person and property

 i have already intimate to you the danger of party in the state with particular reference to the founding of they on geographical discrimination let i now take a more comprehensive view and warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effect of the spirit of party generally

 this spirit unfortunately be inseparable from our nature have its root in the strong passion of the human mind it exist under different shape in all government more or less stifle control or repress but in those of the popular form it be see in its great rankness and be truly their bad enemy

 the alternate domination of one faction over another sharpen by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension which in different age and country have perpetrate the most horrid enormity be itself a frightful despotism but this lead at length to a more formal and permanent despotism the disorder and misery which result gradually incline the mind of man to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual and soon or later the chief of some prevailing faction more able or more fortunate than his competitor turn this disposition to the purpose of his own elevation on the ruin of public liberty

 without look forward to an extremity of this kind which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight the common and continual mischief of the spirit of party be sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it

 it serve always to distract the public council and enfeeble the public administration it agitate the community with ill rounded jealousy and false alarm kindle the animosity of one part against another foment occasionally riot and insurrection it open the door to foreign influence and corruption which find a facilitated access to the government itself through the channel of party passion thus the policy and the will of one country be subject to the policy and will of another

 there be an opinion that party in free country be useful check upon the administration of the government and serve to keep alive the spirit of liberty this within certain limit be probably true and in government of a monarchical cast patriotism may look with indulgence if not with favor upon the spirit of party but in those of the popular character in government purely elective it be a spirit not to be encourage from their natural tendency it be certain there will always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose and there be constant danger of excess the effort ought to be by force of public opinion to mitigate and assuage it a fire not to be quench it demand a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame lest instead of warm it should consume

 it be important likewise that the habit of thinking in a free country should inspire caution in those intrust with its administration to confine themselves within their respective constitutional sphere avoid in the exercise of the power of one department to encroach upon another the spirit of encroachment tend to consolidate the power of all the department in one and thus to create whatever the form of government a real despotism a just estimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which predominate in the human heart be sufficient to satisfy we of the truth of this position the necessity of reciprocal check in the exercise of political power by divide and distribute it into different depository and constitute each the guardian of the public weal against invasion by the other have be evince by experiment ancient and modern some of they in our country and under our own eye to preserve they must be as necessary as to institute they if in the opinion of the people the distribution or modification of the constitutional power be in any particular wrong let it be correct by an amendment in the way which the constitution designate but let there be no change by usurpation for though this in one instance may be the instrument of good it be the customary weapon by which free government be destroy the precedent must always greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit which the use can at any time yield

 of all the disposition and habit which lead to political prosperity religion and morality be indispensable support in vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillar of human happiness these firm prop of the duty of man and citizen the mere politician equally with the pious man ought to respect and to cherish they a volume could not trace all their connection with private and public felicity let it simply be ask where be the security for property for reputation for life if the sense of religious obligation desert the oath which be the instrument of investigation in court of justice and let we with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintain without religion whatever may be concede to the influence of refined education on mind of peculiar structure reason and experience both forbid we to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle

 it be substantially true that virtue or morality be a necessary spring of popular government the rule indeed extend with more or less force to every specie of free government who that be a sincere friend to it can look with indifference upon attempt to shake the foundation of the fabric promote then as an object of primary importance institution 39;for the general diffusion of knowledge in proportion as the structure of a government give force to public opinion it be essential that public opinion should be enlighten

 as a very important source of strength and security cherish public credit one method of preserve it be to use it as sparingly as possible avoid occasion of expense by cultivate peace but remember also that timely disbursement to prepare for danger frequently prevent much great disbursement to repel it avoid likewise the accumulation of debt not only by shun occasion of expense but by vigorous exertion in time of peace to discharge the debt which unavoidable war have occasion not ungenerously throw upon posterity the burthen which we ourselves ought to bear the execution of these maxim belong to your representative but it be necessary that public opinion should cooperate to facilitate to they the performance of their duty it be essential that you should practically bear in mind that toward the payment of debt there must be revenue that to have revenue there must be taxis that no taxis can be devise which be not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant that thee intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the proper object which be always a choice of difficulty ought to be a decisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the government in make it and for a spirit of acquiescence in the measure for obtain revenue which the public exigency may at any time dictate

 observe good faith and justice toward all nation cultivate peace and harmony with all religion and morality enjoin this conduct and can it be that good policy do not equally enjoin it it will be worthy of a free enlighten and at no distant period a great nation to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a people always guide by an exalt justice and benevolence who can doubt that in the course of time and thing the fruit of such a plan would richly repay any temporary advantage which might be lose by a steady adherence to it can it be that providence have not connect the permanent felicity of a nation with its virtue the experiment at least be recommend by every sentiment which ennoble human nature alas be it render impossible by its vice

 in the execution of such a plan nothing be more essential than that permanent inveterate antipathy against particular nation and passionate attachment for other should be exclude and that in place of they just and amicable feeling toward all should be cultivate the nation which indulge toward another an habitual hatred or an habitual fondness be in some degree a slave it be a slave to its animosity or to its affection either of which be sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest antipathy in one nation against another dispose each more readily to offer insult and injury to lay hold of slight cause of umbrage and to be haughty and intractable when accidental or trifle occasion of dispute occur

 hence frequent collision obstinate envenomed and bloody contest the nation prompt by ill will and resentment sometimes impel to war the government contrary to the good calculation of policy the government sometimes participate in the national propensity and adopt through passion what reason would reject at other time it make the animosity of the nation subservient to project of hostility instigate by pride ambition and other sinister and pernicious motive the peace often sometimes perhaps the liberty of nation have be the victim

 so likewise a passionate attachment of one nation for another produce a variety of evil sympathy for the favorite nation facilitate the illusion of an imaginary common interest in case where no real common interest exist and infuse into one the enmity of the other betray the former into a participation in the quarrel and war of the latter without adequate inducement or justification it lead also to concession to the favorite nation of privilege deny to other which be apt doubly to injure the nation make the concession by unnecessarily part with what ought to have be retain and by exciting jealousy ill will and a disposition to retaliate in the party from whom equal privilege be withhold and it give to ambition corrupt or deluded citizen who devote themselves to the favorite nation facility to betray or sacrifice the interest of their own country without odium sometimes even with popularity gild with the appearance of a virtuous sense of obligation a commendable deference for public opinion or a laudable zeal for public good the base or foolish compliance of ambition corruption or infatuation

 as avenue to foreign influence in innumerable way such attachment be particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent patriot how many opportunity do they afford to tamper with domestic faction to practice the art of seduction to mislead public opinion to influence or awe the public council such an attachment of a small or weak toward a great and powerful nation doom the former to be the satellite of the latter against the insidious wile of foreign influence i conjure you to believe i fellow citizen the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake since history and experience prove that foreign influence be one of the most baneful foe of republican government but that jealousy to be useful must be impartial else it become the instrument of the very influence to be avoid instead of a defense against it excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive dislike of another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on one side and serve to veil and even second the art of influence on the other real patriot who may resist the intrigue of the favorite be liable to become suspect and odious while its tool and dupe usurp the applause and confidence of the people to surrender their interest

 the great rule of conduct for we in regard to foreign nation be in extend our commercial relation to have with they as little political connection as possible so far as we have already form engagement let they be fulfil with perfect good faith here let we stop

 europe have a set of primary interest which to we have none or a very remote relation hence she must be engage in frequent controversy the cause of which be essentially foreign to our concern hence therefore it must be unwise in we to implicate ourselves by artificial tie in the ordinary vicissitude of her politic or the ordinary combination and collision of her friendship or enmity

 our detached and distant situation invite and enable we to pursue a different course if we remain one people under an efficient government the period be not far off when we may defy material injury from external annoyance when we may take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously respect when belligerent nation under the impossibility of make acquisition upon we will not lightly hazard the give we provocation when we may choose peace or war as our interest guide by justice shall counsel

 why forego the advantage of so peculiar a situation why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground why by interweave our destiny with that of any part of europe entangle our peace and prosperity in the toil of european ambition rivalship interest humor or caprice

 it be our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any portion of the foreign world so far i mean as we be now at liberty to do it for let i not be understand as capable of patronize infidelity to exist engagement i hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affair that honesty be always the good policy i repeat therefore let those engagement be unwise to extend they

 take care always to keep ourselves by suitable establishment on a respectable defensive posture we may safely trust to temporary alliance for extraordinary emergency

 harmony liberal intercourse with all nation be recommend by policy humanity and interest but even our commercial policy should hold an equal and impartial hand neither seek nor grant exclusive favor or preference consult the natural course of thing diffuse and diversify by gentle mean the stream of commerce but force nothing establish with power so disposed in order to give trade a stable course to define the right of our merchant and to enable the government to support they conventional rule of intercourse the good that present circumstance and mutual opinion will permit but temporary and liable to be from time to time abandon or varied as experience and circumstance shall dictate constantly keep in view that it be folly in one nation to look for disintereste favor from another that it must pay with a portion of its independence for whatever it may accept under that character that by such acceptance it may place itself in the condition of having give equivalent for nominal favor and yet of be reproach with ingratitude for not give more there can be no great error than to expect or calculate upon real favor from nation to nation it be an illusion which experience must cure which a just pride ought to discard

 in offer to you my countryman these counsel of an old and affectionate friend i dare not hope they will make the strong and lasting impression i could wish that they will control the usual current of the passion or prevent our nation from run the course which have hitherto mark the destiny of nation but if i may even flatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit some occasional good that they may now and then recur to moderate the fury of party spirit to warn against the mischief of foreign intrigue to guard against the imposture of pretended patriotism-- this hope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by which they have be dictate

 how far in the discharge of my official duty i have be guide by the principle which have be delineate the public record and other evidence of my conduct must witness to you and to the world to myself the assurance of my own conscience be that i have at least believe myself to be guide by they

 in relation to the still subsist war in europe my proclamation of the 22d of april 1793 be the index to my plan sanction by your approve voice and by that of your representative in both houses of congress the spirit of that measure have continually govern i uninfluence by any attempt to deter or divert i from it

 after deliberate examination with the aid of the good light i could obtain i be well satisfied that our country under all the circumstance of the case have a right to take and be bind in duty and interest to take a neutral position having take it i determine as far as should depend upon i to maintain it with moderation perseverance and firmness

 the consideration which respect the right to hold this conduct it be not necessary on this occasion to detail i will only observe that accord to my understanding of the matter that right so far from be deny by any of the belligerent power have be virtually admit by all

 the duty of hold a neutral conduct may be infer without anything more from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on every nation in case in which it be free to act to maintain inviolate the relation of peace and amity toward other nation

 the inducement of interest for observe that conduct will well be refer to your own reflection and experience with i a predominant motive have be to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and mature its yet recent institution and to progress without interruption to that degree of strength and consistency which be necessary to give it humanly speak the command of its own fortune

 though in review the incident of my administration i be unconscious of intentional error i be nevertheless too sensible of my defect not to think it probable that i may have commit many error whatever they may be i fervently beseech the almighty to avert or mitigate the evil to which they may tend i shall also carry with i the hope that my country will never cease to view they with indulgence and that after forty five year of my life dedicate to its service with an upright zeal the fault of incompetent ability will be consign to oblivion as myself must soon be to the mansion of rest

 rely on its kindness in this as in other thing and actuate by that fervent love toward it which be so natural to a man who view in it the native soil of himself and his progenitor for several generation i anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which i promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of partake in the midst of my fellow citizen the benign influence of good law under a free government the ever favorite object of my heart and the happy reward as i trust of our mutual care labor and danger
  fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives          in      recur to the internal situation of our country since i have last the pleasure      to address you i find ample reason for a renew expression of that gratitude      to the ruler of the universe which a continued series of prosperity have so      often and so justly call forth           the act of the last session which require special arrangement have be    as far as circumstance would admit carry into operation   measure calculate to insure a continuance of the friendship of the indians    and to preserve peace along the extent of our interior frontier have be digest    and adopt in the framing of these care have be take to guard on the one    hand our advanced settlements from the predatory incursion of those unruly    individuals who can not be restrain by their tribes and on the other hand    to protect the right secure to the indians by treaty to draw they nearer    to the civilized state and inspire they with correct conception of the power    as well as justice of the government   the meeting of the deputy from the creek nation at colerain in the state    of georgia which have for a principal object the purchase of a parcel of their    land by that state break up without its being accomplish the nation have    previous to their departure instruct they against make any sale the occasion    however have be improve to confirm by a new treaty with the creeks their    pre exist engagement with the united states and to obtain their consent    to the establishment of trading

promptly conclude    for their evacuation and the united states take possession of the principal    of they comprehend oswego niagara detroit michelimackina and fort miami    where such repair and addition have be order to be make as appear    indispensible   the commissioners appoint on the part of the united states and of great    britain to determine which be the river st. croix mention in the treaty    of peace of 1783 agree in the choice of egbert benson esqr of new york for    the third commissioner the whole meet at st. andrews in passamaquoddy bay    in the beginning of october and direct survey to be make of the rivers in    dispute but deem it impracticable to have these survey complete before    the next year they adjourn to meet at boston in august 1797 for the final    decision of the question   other commissioners appoint on the part of the united states agreeably    to the seventh article of the treaty with great britain relative to capture    and condemnation of vessels and other property meet the commissioners of his    britannic majesty in london in august last when john trumbull esqr be choose    by lot for the fifth commissioner in october follow the board be to proceed    to business as yet there have be no communication of commissioners on the    part of great britain to unite with those who have be appoint on the part    of the united states for carry into effect the sixth article of the treaty   the treaty with spain require that the commissioners for run the boundary    line between the territory of the united states and his catholic majesty 's    provinces of east and west florida should meet at the natchez before the expiration    of six month after the exchange of the ratification which be effect at    aranjuez on the 25th day of april and the troop of his catholic majesty occupy    any posts within the limit of the united states be within the same period    to be withdraw the commissioner of the united states therefore commence    his journey for the natchez in september and troop be order to occupy    the posts from which the spanish garrisons should be withdraw information    have be recently receive of the appointment of a commissioner on the part    of his catholic majesty for run the boundary line but none of any appointment    for the adjustment of the claim of our citizens whose vessels be capture    by the armed vessels of spain   in pursuance of the act of congress pass in the last session for the protection    and relief of american seamen agents be appoint one to reside in great    britain and the other in the west indies the effect of the agency in the    west indies be not yet fully ascertain but those which have be communicate    afford ground to believe the measure will be beneficial the agent destine    to reside in great britain decline to accept the appointment the business    have consequently devolve on the minister of the united states in london and    will command his attention until a new agent shall be appoint   after many delay and disappointment arise out of the european war the    final arrangement for fulfil the engagement make to the dey and regency    of algiers will in all present appearance be crown with success but under    great tho inevitable disadvantage in the pecuniary transaction occasion    by that war which will render a further provision necessary the actual liberation    of all our citizens who be prisoner in algiers while it gratify every    feel heart be itself an earnest of a satisfactory termination of the whole    negotiation measure be in operation for effecting treaties with the regencies    of tunis and tripoli   to an active external commerce the protection of a naval force be indispensable    this be manifest with regard to wars in which a state itself be a party but    besides this it be in our own experience that the most sincere neutrality    be not a sufficient guard against the depredation of nations at war to secure    respect to a neutral flag require a naval force organize and ready to vindicate    it from insult or aggression this may even prevent the necessity of go    to war by discourage belligerent powers from commit such violation of    the right of the neutral party as may first or last leave no other option    from the good information i have be able to obtain it would seem as if our    trade to the mediterranean without a protect force will always be insecure    and our citizens expose to the calamity from which number of they have but    just be relieve   these consideration invite the united states to look to the mean and to    set about the gradual creation of a navy the increase progress of their navigation    promise they at no distant period the requisite supply of seamen and their    mean in other respect favour the undertaking it be an encouragement likewise    that their particular situation will give weight and influence to a moderate    naval force in their hand will it not then be adviseable to begin without    delay to provide and lie up the material for the building and equipping of    ships of war and to proceed in the work by degree in proportion as our resource    shall render it practicable without inconvenience so that a future war of europe    may not find our commerce in the same unprotected state in which it be find    by the present   congress have repeatedly and not without success direct their attention    to the encouragement of manufactures the object be of too much consequence    not to insure a continuance of their effort in every way which shall appear    eligible as a general rule manufacture on public account be inexpedient    but where the state of thing in a country leave little hope that certain    branch of manufacture will for a great length of time obtain when these    be of a nature essential to the furnishing and equipping of the public force    in time of war be not establishment for procure they on public account    to the extent of the ordinary demand for the public service recommend by    strong consideration of national policy as an exception to the general rule    ought our country to remain in such case dependant on foreign supply precarious    because liable to be interrupt if the necessary articles should in this    mode cost more in time of peace will not the security and independence thence    arise form an ample compensation establishment of this sort commensurate    only with the call of the public service in time of peace will in time of    war easily be extend in proportion to the exigency of the government and    may even perhaps be make to yield a surplus for the supply of our citizens at    large so as to mitigate the privation from the interruption of their trade    if adopt the plan ought to exclude all those branch which be already    or likely soon to be establish in the country in order that there may be    no danger of interference with pursuit of individual industry   it will not be doubt that with reference either to individual or national    welfare agriculture be of primary importance in proportion as nation advance    in population and other circumstance of maturity this truth become more    apparent and render the cultivation of the soil more and more an object of    public patronage institution for promote it grow up support by the public    purse and to what object can it be dedicate with great propriety among    the mean which have be employ to this end none have be attend with    great success than the establishment of boards compose of proper character    charge with collect and diffuse information and enable by premium    and small pecuniary aid to encourage and assist a spirit of discovery and    improvement this specie of establishment contribute doubly to the increase    of improvement by stimulate to enterprise and experiment and by draw    to a common centre the result everywhere of individual skill and observation    and spread they thence over the whole nation experience accordingly have    shew that they be very cheap instrument of immense national benefit   i have heretofore propose to the consideration of congress the expediency    of establish a national university and also a military academy the desirableness    of both these institutions have so constantly increase with every new view    i have take of the subject that i can not omit the opportunity of once for    all recall your attention to they   the assembly to which i address myself be too enlighten not to be fully    sensible how much a flourish state of the arts and sciences contribute    to national prosperity and reputation true it be that our country much to    its honor contain many seminaries of learn highly respectable and useful    but the fund upon which they rest be too narrow to command the able professor    in the different department of liberal knowledge for the institution contemplate    though they would be excellent auxiliary   amongst the motive to such an institution the assimilation of the principle    opinion and manner of our country man but the common education of a portion    of our youth from every quarter well deserve attention the more homogeneous    our citizens can be make in these particular the great will be our prospect    of permanent union and a primary object of such a national institution should    be the education of our youth in the science of government in a republic    what species of knowledge can be equally important and what duty more press    on its legislature than to patronize a plan for communicate it to those    who be to be the future guardian of the liberty of the country   the institution of a military academy be also recommend by cogent reason    however pacific the general policy of a nation may be it ought never to be    without an adequate stock of military knowledge for emergency the first would    impair the energy of its character and both would hazard its safety or expose    it to great evil when war could not be avoid besides that war might often    not depend upon its own choice in proportion as the observance of pacific    maxim might exempt a nation from the necessity of practise the rule of    the military art ought to be its care in preserve and transmit by proper    establishment the knowledge of that art whatever argument may be draw from    particular example superficially view a thorough examination of the subject    will evince that the art of war be at once comprehensive and complicated    that it demand much previous study and that the possession of it in its most    improved and perfect state be always of great moment to the security of a nation    this therefore ought to be a serious care of every government and for this    purpose an academy where a regular course of instruction be give be an obvious    expedient which different nation have successfully employ   the compensation to the officer of the united states in various instance    and in none more than in respect to the most important station appear to call    for legislative revision the consequence of a defective provision be of    serious import to the government if private wealth be to supply the defect    of public retribution it will greatly contract the sphere within which the    selection of characters for office be to be make and will proportionally diminish    the probability of a choice of men able as well as upright besides that it    would be repugnant to the vital principle of our government virtually to exclude    from public trust talent and virtue unless accompany by wealth   while in our external relation some serious inconvenience and embarrassment    have be overcome and other lessen it be with much pain and deep regret    i mention that circumstance of a very unwelcome nature have lately occur    our trade have suffer and be suffer extensive injury in the west indies    from the cruisers and agent of the french republic and communication have    be receive from its minister here which indicate the danger of a further    disturbance of our commerce by its authority and which be in other respect    far from agreeable   it have be my constant sincere and earnest wish in conformity with that    of our nation to maintain cordial harmony and a perfectly friendly understanding    with that republic this wish remain unabated and i shall persevere in the    endeavour to fulfil it to the utmost extent of what shall be consistent with    a just and indispensable regard to the right and honour of our country nor    will i easily cease to cherish the expectation that a spirit of justice candour    and friendship on the part of the republic will eventually ensure success   in pursue this course however i can not forget what be due to the character    of our government and nation or to a full and entire confidence in the good    sense patriotism selfrespect and fortitude of my countrymen   i reserve for a special message a more particular communication on this interesting    subject   gentleman of the house of representatives i have direct an estimate of    the appropriations necessary for the service of the ensue year to be submit    from the proper department with a view of the public receipt and expenditure    to the late period to which an account can be prepare   it be with satisfaction i be able to inform you that the revenue of the    united states continue in a state of progressive improvement   a reinforcement of the exist provision for discharge our public debt    be mention in my address at the opening of the last session some preliminary    step be take towards it the mature of which will no doubt engage your    zealous attention during the present i will only add that it will afford i    heart feel satisfaction to concur in such further measure as will ascertain    to our country the prospect of a speedy extinguishment of the debt posterity    may have cause to regret if from any motive interval of tranquillity be    leave unimproved for accelerate this valuable end   gentleman of the senate and of the house of representatives my solicitude    to see the militia of the united states place on an efficient establishment    have be so often and so ardently express that i shall but barely recall    the subject to your view on the present occasion at the same time that i shall    submit to your enquiry whether our harbours be yet sufficiently secure   the situation in which i now stand for the last time in the midst of the    representatives of the people of the united states naturally recall the period    when the administration of the present form of government commence and i can not    omit the occasion to congratulate you and my country on the success of the    experiment nor to repeat my fervent supplication to the supreme ruler of the    universe and sovereign arbiter of nations that his providential care may still    be extend to the united states that the virtue and happiness of the people    may be preserve and that the government which they have institute for the    protection of their liberty maybe perpetual
when it be first perceive in early time that no middle course for america remain between unlimited submission to a foreign legislature and a total independence of its claim man of reflection be less apprehensive of danger from the formidable power of fleet and army they must determine to resist than from those contest and dissension which would certainly arise concern the form of government to be institute over the whole and over the part of this extensive country rely however on the purity of their intention the justice of their cause and the integrity and intelligence of the people under an overruling providence which have so signally protect this country from the first the representative of this nation then consist of little more than half its present number not only break to piece the chain which be forge and the rod of iron that be lift up but frankly cut asunder the tie which have bind they and launch into an ocean of uncertainty

 the zeal and ardor of the people during the revolutionary war supply the place of government command a degree of order sufficient at least for the temporary preservation of society the confederation which be early feel to be necessary be prepare from the model of the batavian and helvetic confederacy the only example which remain with any detail and precision in history and certainly the only one which the people at large have ever consider but reflect on the strike difference in so many particular between this country and those where a courier may go from the seat of government to the frontier in a single day it be then certainly foresee by some who assist in congress at the formation of it that it could not be durable

 negligence of its regulation inattention to its recommendation if not disobedience to its authority not only in individual but in states soon appear with their melancholy consequences?universal languor jealousy and rivalry of states decline of navigation and commerce discouragement of necessary manufacture universal fall in the value of land and their produce contempt of public and private faith loss of consideration and credit with foreign nation and at length in discontent animosity combination partial convention and insurrection threaten some great national calamity

 in this dangerous crisis the people of america be not abandon by their usual good sense presence of mind resolution or integrity measure be pursue to concert a plan to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquillity provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessing of liberty the public disquisition discussion and deliberation issue in the present happy constitution of government

 employ in the service of my country abroad during the whole course of these transaction i first see the constitution of the united states in a foreign country irritate by no literary altercation animate by no public debate heat by no party animosity i read it with great satisfaction as the result of good head prompt by good heart as an experiment well adapt to the genius character situation and relation of this nation and country than any which have ever be propose or suggest in its general principle and great outline it be conformable to such a system of government as i have ever most esteem and in some states my own native state in particular have contribute to establish claim a right of suffrage in common with my fellow citizen in the adoption or rejection of a constitution which be to rule i and my posterity as well as they and their i do not hesitate to express my approbation of it on all occasion in public and in private it be not then nor have be since any objection to it in my mind that the executive and senate be not more permanent nor have i ever entertain a thought of promote any alteration in it but such as the people themselves in the course of their experience should see and feel to be necessary or expedient and by their representative in congress and the state legislature accord to the constitution itself adopt and ordain

 return to the bosom of my country after a painful separation from it for ten year i have the honor to be elect to a station under the new order of thing and i have repeatedly lay myself under the most serious obligation to support the constitution the operation of it have equal the most sanguine expectation of its friend and from an habitual attention to it satisfaction in its administration and delight in its effect upon the peace order prosperity and happiness of the nation i have acquire an habitual attachment to it and veneration for it

 what other form of government indeed can so well deserve our esteem and love

 there may be little solidity in an ancient idea that congregation of man into city and nation be the most pleasing object in the sight of superior intelligence but this be very certain that to a benevolent human mind there can be no spectacle present by any nation more pleasing more noble majestic or august than an assembly like that which have so often be see in this and the other chamber of congress of a government in which the executive authority as well as that of all the branch of the legislature be exercise by citizen select at regular period by their neighbor to make and execute law for the general good can anything essential anything more than mere ornament and decoration be add to this by robe and diamond can authority be more amiable and respectable when it descend from accident or institution establish in remote antiquity than when it spring fresh from the heart and judgment of an honest and enlighten people for it be the people only that be represent it be their power and majesty that be reflect and only for their good in every legitimate government under whatever form it may appear the existence of such a government as ours for any length of time be a full proof of a general dissemination of knowledge and virtue throughout the whole body of the people and what object or consideration more pleasing than this can be present to the human mind if national pride be ever justifiable or excusable it be when it spring not from power or rich grandeur or glory but from conviction of national innocence information and benevolence

 in the midst of these pleasing idea we should be unfaithful to ourselves if we should ever lose sight of the danger to our liberty if anything partial or extraneous should infect the purity of our free fair virtuous and independent election if an election be to be determine by a majority of a single vote and that can be procure by a party through artifice or corruption the government may be the choice of a party for its own end not of the nation for the national good if that solitary suffrage can be obtain by foreign nation by flattery or menace by fraud or violence by terror intrigue or venality the government may not be the choice of the american people but of foreign nation it may be foreign nation who govern we and not we the people who govern ourselves and candid man will acknowledge that in such case choice would have little advantage to boast of over lot or chance

 such be the amiable and interesting system of government and such be some of the abuse to which it may be expose which the people of america have exhibit to the admiration and anxiety of the wise and virtuous of all nation for eight year under the administration of a citizen who by a long course of great action regulate by prudence justice temperance and fortitude conduct a people inspire with the same virtue and animate with the same ardent patriotism and love of liberty to independence and peace to increase wealth and unexampled prosperity have merit the gratitude of his fellow citizen command the high praise of foreign nation and secure immortal glory with posterity

the personal inconvenience to the member of the senate and of the house of representatives in leave their family and private affair at this season of the year be so obvious that i the more regret the extraordinary occasion which have render the convention of congress indispensable it would have afford i the high satisfaction to have be able to congratulate you on a restoration of peace to the nation of europe whose animosity have endanger our tranquillity but we have still abundant cause of gratitude to the supreme dispenser of national blessings for general health and promising season for domestic and social happiness for the rapid progress and ample acquisition of industry through extensive territory for civil political and religious liberty while other state be desolate with foreign war or convulse with intestine division the united states present the pleasing prospect of a nation govern by mild and equal law generally satisfied with the possession of the right neither envy the advantage nor fear the power of other nation solicitous only for the maintenance of order and justice and the preservation of liberty increase daily in their attachment to a system of government in proportion to their experience of its utility yield a ready and general obedience to law flow from the reason and rest on the only solid foundation the affection of the people it be with extreme regret that i shall be oblige to turn your thought to other circumstance which admonish we that some of these felicity may not be last but if the tide of our prosperity be full and a reflux commencing a vigilant circumspection become we that we may meet our reverse with fortitude and extricate ourselves from their consequence with all the skill we possess and all the effort in our power in give to congress information of the state of the union and recommend to their consideration such measure as appear to i to be necessary or expedient accord to my constitutional duty the cause and the object of the present extraordinary session will be explain after the president of the united states receive information that the french government have express serious discontent at some proceeding of the government of these state say to affect the interest of france he think it expedient to send to that country a new minister fully instruct to enter on such amicable discussion and to give such candid explanation as might happily remove the discontent and suspicion of the french government and vindicate the conduct of the united states for this purpose he select from among his fellow citizen a character whose integrity talent experience and service have place he in the rank of the most esteemed and respect in the nation the direct object of his mission be express in his letter of credence to the french republic be to maintain that good understanding which from the commencement of the alliance have subsist between the two nation and to efface unfavorable impression banish suspicion and restore that cordiality which be at once the evidence and pledge of a friendly union and his instruction be to the same effect faithfully to represent the disposition of the government and people of the united states their disposition be 1 to remove jealousy and obviate complaint by shew that they be groundless to restore that mutual confidence which have be so unfortunately and injuriously impaired and to explain the relative interest of both country and the real sentiment of his own a minister thus specially commission it be expect would have prove the instrument of restore mutual confidence between the two republic the first step of the french government correspond with that expectation a few day before his arrival at paris the french minister of foreign relation inform the american minister then resident at paris of the formality to be observe by himself in take leave and by his successor preparatory to his reception these formality they observe and on the 9th of december present officially to the minister of foreign relation the one a copy of his letter of recall the other a copy of his letter of credence these be lay before the executive directory two day afterwards the minister of foreign relation inform the recall american minister that the executive directory have determine not to receive another minister plenipotentiary from the united states until after the redress of grievance demand of the american government and which the french republic have a right to expect from it the american minister immediately endeavor to ascertain whether by refuse to receive he it be intend that he should retire from the territory of the french republic and verbal answer be give that such be the intention of the directory for his own justification he desire a write answer but obtain none until toward the last of january when receive notice in writing to quit the territory of the republic he proceed to amsterdam where he propose to wait for instruction from this government during his residence at paris card of hospitality be refuse he and he be threaten with be subject to the jurisdiction of the minister of police but with become firmness he insist on the protection of the law of nation due to he as the know minister of a foreign power you will derive further information from his dispatch which will be lay before you as it be often necessary that nation should treat for the mutual advantage of their affair and especially to accommodate and terminate difference and as they can treat only by minister the right of embassy be well know and establish by the law and usage of nation the refusal on the part of france to receive our minister be then the denial of a right but the receive he until we have accede to their demand without discussion and without investigation be to treat we neither as ally nor as friend nor as a sovereign state with this conduct of the french government it will be proper to take into view the public audience give to the late minister of the united states on his taking leave of the executive directory the speech of the president disclose sentiment more alarming than the refusal of a minister because more dangerous to our independence and union and at the same time studiously mark with indignity toward the government of the united states it evince a disposition to separate the people of the united states from the government to persuade they that they have different affection principle and interest from those of their fellow citizen whom they themselves have choose to manage their common concern and thus to produce division fatal to our peace such attempt ought to be repel with a decision which shall convince france and the world that we be not a degraded people humiliate under a colonial spirit of fear and sense of inferiority fit to be the miserable instrument of foreign influence and regardless of national honor character and interest i should have be happy to have throw a veil over these transaction if it have be possible to conceal they but they have pass on the great theater of the world in the face of all europe and america and with such circumstance of publicity and solemnity that they can not be disguise and will not soon be forget they have inflict a wound in the american breast it be my sincere desire however that it may be heal it be my sincere desire and in this i presume i concur with you and with our constituent to preserve peace and friendship with all nation and believe that neither the honor nor the interest of the united states absolutely forbid the repetition of advance for secure these desirable object with france i shall institute a fresh attempt at negotiation and shall not fail to promote and accelerate an accommodation on term compatible with the right duty interest and honor of the nation if we have commit error and these can be demonstrate we shall be willing on conviction to redress they and equal measure of justice we have a right to expect from france and every other nation the diplomatic intercourse between the united states and france be at present suspend the government have no mean of obtain official information from that country nevertheless there be reason to believe that the executive directory pass a decree on the 2nd of march last contravene in part the treaty of amity and commerce of 1778 injurious to our lawful commerce and endanger the life of our citizen a copy of this decree will be lay before you while we be endeavor to adjust all our difference with france by amicable negotiation the progress of the war in europe the depredation on our commerce the personal injury to our citizen and the general complexion of affair render it my indispensable duty to recommend to your consideration effectual measure of defense the commerce of the united states have become an interesting object of attention whether we consider it in relation to the wealth and finance or the strength and resource of the nation with a sea coast of near 2000 mile in extent open a wide field for fishery navigation and commerce a great portion of our citizen naturally apply their industry and enterprise to these object any serious and permanent injury to commerce would not fail to produce the most embarrassing disorder to prevent it from be undermine and destroy it be essential that it receive an adequate protection the naval establishment must occur to every man who consider the injury commit on our commerce the insult offer to our citizen and the description of vessel by which these abuse have be practice as the suffering of our mercantile and sea fare citizen can not be ascribe to the omission of duty demandable consider the neutral situation of our country they be to be attribute to the hope of impunity arise from a suppose inability on our part to afford protection to resist the consequence of such impression on the mind of foreign nation and to guard against the degradation and servility which they must finally stamp on the american character be an important duty of government a naval power next to the militia be the natural defense of the united states the experience of the last war would be sufficient to shew that a moderate naval force such as would be easily within the present ability of the union would have be sufficient to have baffle many formidable transportation of troop from one state to another which be then practice our sea coast from their great extent be more easily annoyed and more easily defend by a naval force than any other with all the material our country abound in skill our naval architect and navigator be equal to any and commander and sea man will not be want but although the establishment of a permanent system of naval defense appear to be requisite i be sensible it can not be form so speedily and extensively as the present crisis demand hitherto i have think proper to prevent the sailing of armed vessel except on voyage to the east indies where general usage and the danger from pirate appear to render the permission proper yet the restriction have originate solely from a wish to prevent collision with the power at war contravene the act of congress of june 1794 and not from any doubt entertain by i of the policy and propriety of permit our vessel to employ mean of defense while engage in a lawful foreign commerce it remain for congress to prescribe such regulation as will enable our sea fare citizen to defend themselves against violation of the law of nation and at the same time restrain they from commit act of hostility against the power at war in addition to this voluntary provision for defense by individual citizen it appear to i necessary to equip the frigate and provide other vessel of inferior force to take under convoy such merchant vessel as shall remain unarmed the great part of the cruiser whose depredation have be most injurious have be build and some of they partially equip in the united states although an effectual remedy may be attend with difficulty yet i have think it my duty to present the subject generally to your consideration if a mode can be devise by the wisdom of congress to prevent the resource of the united states from be convert into the mean of annoy our trade a great evil will be prevent with the same view i think it proper to mention that some of our citizen resident abroad have fit out privateer and other have voluntarily take the command or enter on board of they and commit spoliation on the commerce of the united states such unnatural and iniquitous practice can be restrain only by severe punishment but besides a protection of our commerce on the sea i think it highly necessary to protect it at home where it be collect in our most important port the distance of the united states from europe and the well know promptitude ardor and courage of the people in defense of their country happily diminish the probability of invasion nevertheless to guard against sudden and predatory incursion the situation of some of our principal sea port demand your consideration and as our country be vulnerable in other interest besides those of its commerce you will seriously deliberate whether the mean of general defense ought not to be increase by an addition to the regular artillery and cavalry and by arrangement for form a provisional army with the same view and as a measure which even in a time of universal peace ought not to be neglect i recommend to your consideration a revision of the law for organize arming and discipline the militia to render that natural and safe defense of the country efficacious although it be very true that we ought not to involve ourselves in the political system of europe but to keep ourselves always distinct and separate from it if we can yet to effect this separation early punctual and continual information of the current chain of event and of the political project in contemplation be no less necessary than if we be directly concerned in they it be necessary in order to the discovery of the effort make to draw we into the vortex in season to make preparation against they however we may consider ourselves the maritime and commercial power of the world will consider the united states of america as form a weight in that balance of power in europe which never can be forget or neglect it would not only be against our interest but it would be do wrong to half of europe at least if we should voluntarily throw ourselves into either scale it be a natural policy for a nation that study to be neutral to consult with other nation engage in the same study and pursuit at the same time that measure might be pursue with this view our treaty with prussia and sweden one of which be expire and the other near expiring might be renew gentleman of the house of representatives it be particularly your province to consider the state of the public finance and to adopt such measure respect they as exigency shall be find to require the preservation of public credit the regular extinguishment of the public debt and a provision of fund to defray any extraordinary expense will of course call for your serious attention although the imposition of new burthen can not be in itself agreeable yet there be no ground to doubt that the american people will expect from you such measure as their actual engagement their present security and future interest demand gentleman of the senate and gentlemen of the house of representatives the present situation of our country impose an obligation on all the department of government to adopt an explicit and decide conduct in my situation an exposition of the principle by which my administration will be govern ought not be omit it be impossible to conceal from ourselves or the world what have be before observe that endeavor have be employ to foster and establish a division between the government and people of the united states to investigate the cause which have encourage this attempt be not necessary but to repel by decide and united council insinuation so derogatory to the honor and aggression so dangerous to the constitution union and even independence of the nation be an indispensable duty it must not be permit to be doubt whether the people of the united states will support the government establish by their voluntary consent and appoint by their free choice or whether by surrender themselves to the direction of foreign and domestic faction in opposition to their own government they will forfeit the honorable station they have hitherto maintain for myself having never be indifferent to what concern the interest of my country devote the good part of my life to obtain and support its independence and constantly witness the patriotism fidelity and perseverance of my fellow citizen on the most try occasion it be not for i to hesitate or abandon a cause in which my heart have be so long engage convince that the conduct of the government have be just and impartial to foreign nation that those internal regulation which have be establish by law for the preservation of peace be in their nature proper and that they have be fairly execute nothing will ever be do by i to impair the national engagement to innovate upon principle which have be so deliberately and uprightly establish or to surrender in any manner the right of the government to enable i to maintain this declaration i rely under god with entire confidence on the firm and enlighten support of the national legislature and upon the virtue and patriotism of my fellow citizen
i be for some time apprehensive that it would be necessary on account of the contagious sickness which afflict the city of philadelphia to convene the national legislature at some other place this measure it be desirable to avoid because it would occasion much public inconvenience and a considerable public expense and add to the calamity of the inhabitant of this city whose suffering must have excite the sympathy of all their fellow citizen therefore after take measure to ascertain the state and decline of the sickness i postpone my determination have hope now happily realize that without hazard to the life or health of the member congress might assemble at this place where it be next by law to meet i submit however to your consideration whether a power to postpone the meeting of congress without pass the time fix by the constitution upon such occasion would not be a useful amendment to the law of 1794 although i can not yet congratulate you on the reestablishment of peace in europe and the restoration of security to the person and property of our citizen from injustice and violence at sea we have nevertheless abundant cause of gratitude to the source of benevolence and influence for interior tranquillity and personal security for propitious season prosperous agriculture productive fishery and general improvement and above all for a rational spirit of civil and religious liberty and a calm but steady determination to support our sovereignty as well as our moral and our religious principle against all open and secret attack our envoy extraordinary to the french republic embark one in july the other in august to join their colleague in holland i have receive intelligence of the arrival of both of they in holland from whence they all proceed on their journey to paris within a few day of the 19th of september whatever may be the result of this mission i trust that nothing will have be omit on my part to conduct the negotiation to a successful conclusion on such equitable term as may be compatible with the safety honor and interest of the united states nothing in the mean time will contribute so much to the preservation of peace and the attainment of justice as manifestation of that energy and unanimity of which on many former occasion the people of the united states have give such memorable proof and the exertion of those resource for national defense which a beneficent providence have kindly place within their power it may be confidently assert that nothing have occur since the adjournment of congress which render inexpedient those precautionary measure recommend by i to the consideration of the two houses at the opening of your late extraordinary session if that system be then prudent it be more so now as increase depredation strengthen the reason for its adoption indeed whatever may be the issue of the negotiation with france and whether the war in europe be or be not to continue i hold it most certain that permanent tranquillity and order will not soon be obtain the state of society have so long be disturb the sense of moral and religious obligation so much weaken public faith and national honor have be so impaired respect to treaty have be so diminished and the law of nation have lose so much of its force while pride ambition avarice and violence have be so long unrestraine there remain no reasonable ground on which to raise an expectation that a commerce without protection or defense will not be plunder the commerce of the united states be essential if not to their existence at least to their comfort their growth prosperity and happiness the genius character and habit of the people be highly commercial their city have be form and exist upon commerce our agriculture fishery art and manufacture be connect with and depend upon it in short commerce have make this country what it be and it can not be destroy or neglect without involve the people in poverty and distress great number be directly and solely support by navigation the faith of society be pledge for the preservation of the right of commercial and sea fare no less than of the other citizen under this view of our affair i should hold myself guilty of a neglect of duty if i forbear to recommend that we should make every exertion to protect our commerce and to place our country in a suitable posture of defense as the only sure mean of preserve both i have entertain an expectation that it would have be in my power at the opening of this session to have communicate to you the agreeable information of the due execution of our treaty with his catholic majesty respect the withdrawing of his troop from our territory and the demarcation of the line of limit but by the late authentic intelligence spanish garrison be still continue within our country and the running of the boundary line have not be commence these circumstance be the more to be regret as they can not fail to affect the indians in a manner injurious to the united states still however indulge the hope that the answer which have be give will remove the objection offer by the spanish officer to the immediate execution of the treaty i have judge it proper that we should continue in readiness to receive the post and to run the line of limit further information on this subject will be communicate in the course of the session in connection with this unpleasant state of thing on our western frontier it be proper for i to mention the attempt of foreign agent to alienate the affection of the indian nation and to excite they to actual hostility against the united states great activity have be exert by those person who have insinuate themselves among the indian tribe reside within the territory of the united states to influence they to transfer their affection and force to a foreign nation to form they into a confederacy and prepare they for war against the united states although measure have be take to counteract these infraction of our right to prevent indian hostility and to preserve entire their attachment to the united states it be my duty to observe that to give a well effect to these measure and to obviate the consequence of a repetition of such practice a law provide adequate punishment for such offense may be necessary the commissioner appoint under the 5th article of the treaty of amity commerce and navigation between the united states and great britain to ascertain the river which be truly intend under the name of the river st. croix mention in the treaty of peace meet at passamaquoddy bay in 1796 october and view the mouth of the river in question and the adjacent shore and island and be of opinion that actual survey of both river to their source be necessary give to the agent of the two nation instruction for that purpose and adjourn to meet at boston in august they meet but the survey require more time than have be suppose and not be then complete the commissioner again adjourn to meet at providence in the state of rhode island in june next when we may expect a final examination and decision the commissioner appoint in pursuance of the 6th article of the treaty meet at philadelphia in may last to examine the claim of british subject for debt contract before the peace and still remain due to they from citizen or inhabitant of the united states various cause have hitherto prevent any determination but the business be now resume and doubtless will be prosecute without interruption several decision on the claim of citizen of the united states for loss and damage sustain by reason of irregular and illegal capture or condemnation of their vessel or other property have be make by the commissioner in london conformably to the 7th article of the treaty the sum award by the commissioner have be pay by the british government a considerable number of other claim where cost and damage and not capture property be the only object in question have be decide by arbitration and the sum award to the citizen of the united states have also be pay the commissioner appoint agreeably to the 21st article of our treaty with spain meet at philadelphia in the summer past to examine and decide on the claim of our citizen for loss they have sustain in consequence of their vessel and cargoe having be take by the subject of his catholic majesty during the late war between spain and france their sitting have be interrupt but be now resume the united states be obligate to make compensation for the loss and damage sustain by british subject upon the award of the commissioner act under the 6th article of the treaty with great britain and for the loss and damage sustain by british subject by reason of the capture of their vessel and merchandise take within the limit and jurisdiction of the united states and bring into their port or take by vessel originally arm in port of the united states upon the award of the commissioner act under the 7th article of the same treaty it be necessary that provision be make for fulfil these obligation the numerous capture of american vessel by the cruiser of the french republic and of some by those of spain have occasion considerable expense in make and support the claim of our citizen before their tribunal the sum require for this purpose have in diver instance be disburse by the consul of the united states by mean of the same capture great number of our sea man have be throw ashore in foreign country destitute of all mean of subsistence and the sick in particular have be expose to grievous suffering the consul have in these case also advance money for their relief for these advance they reasonably expect reimbursement from the united states the consular act relative to sea man require revision and amendment the provision for their support in foreign country and for their return be find to be inadequate and ineffectual another provision seem necessary to be add to the consular act some foreign vessel have be discover sailing under the flag of the united states and with forge paper it seldom happen that the consul can detect this deception because they have no authority to demand an inspection of the register and sea letter gentleman of the house of representatives it be my duty to recommend to your serious consideration those object which by the constitution be place particularly within your sphere the national debt and taxis since the decay of the feudal system by which the public defense be provide for chiefly at the expense of individual the system of loan have be introduce and as no nation can raise within the year by taxis sufficient sum for its defense and military operation in time of war the sum loan and debt contract have necessarily become the subject of what have be call funding system the consequence arise from the continual accumulation of public debt in other country ought to admonish we to be careful to prevent their growth in our own the national defense must be provide for as well as the support of government but both should be accomplish as much as possible by immediate taxis and as little as possible by loan the estimate for the service of the ensue year will by my direction be lay before you gentleman of the senate and gentlemen of the house of representatives we be meet together at a most interesting period the situation of the principal power of europe be singular and portentous connect with some by treaty and with all by commerce no important event there can be indifferent to we such circumstance call with peculiar importunity not less for a disposition to unite in all those measure on which the honor safety and prosperity of our country depend than for all the exertion of wisdom and firmness in all such measure you may rely on my zealous and hearty concurrence
as the safety and prosperity of nation ultimately and essentially depend on the protection and the blessing of almighty god and the national acknowledgment of this truth be not only an indispensable duty which the people owe to he but a duty whose natural influence be favorable to the promotion of that morality and piety without which social happiness can not exist nor the blessing of a free government be enjoy and as this duty at all time incumbent be so especially in season of difficulty or of danger when exist or threatening calamity the just judgment of god against prevalent iniquity be a loud call to repentance and reformation and as the united states of america be at present place in a hazardous and afflictive situation by the unfriendly disposition conduct and demand of a foreign power evince by repeat refusal to receive our messenger of reconciliation and peace by depredation on our commerce and the infliction of injury on very many of our fellow citizen while engage in their lawful business on the sea under these consideration it have appear to i that the duty of implore the mercy and benediction of heaven on our country demand at this time a special attention from its inhabitant

 i have therefore think fit to recommend and i do hereby recommend that wednesday the 9th day of may next be observe throughout the united states as a day of solemn humiliation fasting and prayer that the citizen of these states abstain on that day from their customary worldly occupation offer their devout address to the father of mercies agreeably to those form or method which they have severally adopt as the most suitable and become that all religious congregation do with the deep humility acknowledge before god the manifold sin and transgression with which we be justly chargeable as individual and as a nation beseech he at the same time of his infinite grace through the redeemer of the world freely to remit all our offense and to incline we by his holy spirit to that sincere repentance and reformation which may afford we reason to hope for his inestimable favor and heavenly benediction that it be make the subject of particular and earnest supplication that our country may be protect from all the danger which threaten it that our civil and religious privilege may be preserve inviolate and perpetuate to the late generation that our public council and magistrate may be especially enlighten and direct at this critical period that the american people may be unite in those bond of amity and mutual confidence and inspire with that vigor and fortitude by which they have in time past be so highly distinguished and by which they have obtain such invaluable advantage that the health of the inhabitant of our land may be preserve and their agriculture commerce fishery art and manufacture be bless and prosper that the principle of genuine piety and sound morality may influence the mind and govern the life of every description of our citizen and that the blessing of peace freedom and pure religion may be speedily extend to all the nation of the earth

 and finally i recommend that on the say day the duty of humiliation and prayer be accompany by fervent thanksgiving to the bestower of every good gift not only for his having hitherto protect and preserve the people of these united states in the independent enjoyment of their religious and civil freedom but also for having prosper they in a wonderful progress of population and for confer on they many and great favor conducive to the happiness and prosperity of a nation

 give under my hand and the seal of the united states of america at philadelphia this 23d day of march a. d. 1798 and of the independence of the say states the twenty second

 timothy pickering

 secretary of state
gentleman of the senate and gentlemen of the house of representatives while with reverence and resignation we contemplate the dispensation of divine providence in the alarming and destructive pestilence with which several of our city and town have be visit there be cause for gratitude and mutual congratulation that the malady have disappear and that we be again permit to assemble in safety at the seat of government for the discharge of our important duty but when we reflect that this fatal disorder have within a few year make repeat ravage in some of our principal sea port and with increase malignancy and when we consider the magnitude of the evil arise from the interruption of public and private business whereby the national interest be deeply affect i think it my duty to invite the legislature of the union to examine the expediency of establish suitable regulation in aid of the health law of the respective states for these be form on the idea that contagious sickness may be communicate through the channel of commerce there seem to be a necessity that congress who alone can regulate trade should frame a system which while it may tend to preserve the general health may be compatible with the interest of commerce and the safety of the revenue while we think on this calamity and sympathize with the immediate sufferer we have abundant reason to present to the supreme be our annual oblation of gratitude for a liberal participation in the ordinary blessing of his providence to the usual subject of gratitude i can not omit to add one of the 1st importance to our well being and safety i mean that spirit which have arise in our country against the menace and aggression of a foreign nation a manly sense of national honor dignity and independence have appear which if encourage and invigorate by every branch of the government will enable we to view undismaye the enterprise of any foreign power and become the sure foundation of national prosperity and glory the course of the transaction in relation to the united states and france which have come to my knowledge during your recess will be make the subject of a future communication that communication will confirm the ultimate failure of the measure which have be take by the government of the united states toward an amicable adjustment of difference with that power you will at the same time perceive that the french government appear solicitous to impress the opinion that it be averse to a rupture with this country and that it have in a qualified manner declare itself willing to receive a minister from the united states for the purpose of restore a good understanding it be unfortunate for profession of this kind that they should be express in term which may countenance the inadmissible pretension of a right to prescribe the qualification which a minister from the united states should possess and that while france be assert the existence of a disposition on her part to conciliate with sincerity the difference which have arise the sincerity of a like disposition on the part of the united states of which so many demonstrative proof have be give should even be indirectly question it be also worthy of observation that the decree of the directory allege to be intend to restrain the depredation of french cruiser on our commerce have not give and can not give any relief it enjoin they to conform to all the law of france relative to cruise and prize while these law be themselves the source of the depredation of which we have so long so justly and so fruitlessly complain the law of france enact in january last which subject to capture and condemnation neutral vessel and their cargo if any portion of the latter be of british fabric or produce although the entire property belong to neutral instead of be rescind have lately receive a confirmation by the failure of a proposition for its repeal while this law which be an unequivocal act of war on the commerce of the nation it attack continue in force those nation can see in the french government only a power regardless of their essential right of their independence and sovereignty and if they possess the mean they can reconcile nothing with their interest and honor but a firm resistance hitherto therefore nothing be discoverable in the conduct of france which ought to change or relax our measure of defense on the contrary to extend and invigorate they be our true policy we have no reason to regret that these measure have be thus far adopt and pursue and in proportion as we enlarge our view of the portentous and incalculable situation of europe we shall discover new and cogent motive for the full development of our energy and resource but in demonstrate by our conduct that we do not fear war in the necessary protection of our right and honor we shall give no room to infer that we abandon the desire of peace an efficient preparation for war can alone insure peace it be peace that we have uniformly and perseveringly cultivate and harmony between we and france may be restore at her option but to send another minister without more determinate assurance that he would be receive would be an act of humiliation to which the united states ought not to submit it must therefore be leave with france if she be indeed desirous of accommodation to take the requisite step the united states will steadily observe the maxim by which they have hitherto be govern they will respect the sacred right of embassy and with a sincere disposition on the part of france to desist from hostility to make reparation for the injury heretofore inflict on our commerce and to do justice in future there will be no obstacle to the restoration of a friendly intercourse in make to you this declaration i give a pledge to france and the world that the executive authority of this country still adhere to the humane and pacific policy which have invariably govern its proceeding in conformity with the wish of the other branch of the government and of the people of the united states but consider the late manifestation of her policy toward foreign nation i deem it a duty deliberately and solemnly to declare my opinion that whether we negotiate with she or not vigorous preparation for war will be alike indispensable these alone will give to we an equal treaty and insure its observance among the measure of preparation which appear expedient i take the liberty to recall your attention to the naval establishment the beneficial effect of the small naval armament provide under the act of the last session be know and acknowledge perhaps no country ever experience more sudden and remarkable advantage from any measure of policy than we have derive from the arming for our maritime protection and defense we ought without loss of time to lay the foundation for an increase of our navy to a size sufficient to guard our coast and protect our trade such a naval force as it be doubtless in the power of the united states to create and maintain would also afford to they the good mean of general defense by facilitate the safe transportation of troop and store to every part of our extensive coast to accomplish this important object a prudent foresight require that systematic measure be adopt for procure at all time the requisite timber and other supply in what manner this shall be do i leave to your consideration i will now advert gentleman to some matter of less moment but proper to be communicate to the national legislature after the spanish garrison have evacuate the post they occupy at the natchez and walnut hills the commissioner of the united states commence his observation to ascertain the point near the mississippi which terminate the northernmost part of the 31st degree of north latitude from thence he proceed to run the boundary line between the united states and spain he be afterwards join by the spanish commissioner when the work of the former be confirm and they proceed together to the demarcation of the line recent information render it probably that the southern indians either instigate to oppose the demarcation or jealous of the consequence of suffer white people to run a line over land to which the indian title have not be extinguish have ere this time stop the progress of the commissioner and consider the mischief which may result from continue the demarcation in opposition to the will of the indian tribe the great expense attend it and that the boundary which the commissioner have actually establish probably extend at least as far as the indian title have be extinguish it will perhaps become expedient and necessary to suspend further proceeding by recall our commissioner the commissioner appoint in pursuance of the 5th article of the treaty of amity commerce and navigation between the united states and his britannic majesty to determine what river be truly intend under the name of the river st. croix mention in the treaty of peace and form a part of the boundary therein describe have finally decide that question on the 25th of october they make their declaration that a river call scoodiac which fall into passamaquoddy bay at its northwestern quarter be the true st. croix intend in the treaty of peace as far as its great fork where one of its stream come from the westward and the other from the northward and that the latter stream be the continuation of the st. croix to its source this decision it be understand will preclude all contention among the individual claimant as it seem that the scoodiac and its northern branch bind the grant of land which have be make by the respective adjoining government a subordinate question however it have be suggest still remain to be determine between the mouth of the st. croix as now settle and what be usually call the bay of fundy lie a number of valuable island the commissioner have not continue the boundary line through any channel of these island and unless the bay of passamaquoddy be a part of the bay of fundy this further adjustment of boundary will be necessary but it be apprehend that this will not be a matter of any difficulty such progress have be make in the examination and decision of case of capture and condemnation of american vessel which be the subject of the 7th article of the treaty of amity commerce and navigation between the united states and great britain that it be suppose the commissioner will be able to bring their business to a conclusion in august of the ensue year the commissioner act under the 25th article of the treaty between the united states and spain have adjust most of the claim of our citizen for loss sustain in consequence of their vessel and cargoe having be take by the subject of his catholic majesty during the late
