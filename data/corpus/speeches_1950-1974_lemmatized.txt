my fellow americans
 i want to talk to you plainly tonight about what we be do in korea and about our policy in the far east
 in the simple term what we be do in korea be this we be try to prevent a third world war
 i think most people in this country recognize that fact last june and they warmly support the decision of the government to help the republic of korea against the communist aggressor now many person even some who applaud our decision to defend korea have forget the basic reason for our action
 it be right for we to be in korea now it be right last june it be right today
 i want to remind you why this be true
 the communists in the kremlin be engage in a monstrous conspiracy to stamp out freedom all over the world if they be to succeed the united states would be number among their principal victim it must be clear to everyone that the united states cannot and will not sit idly by and await foreign conquest the only question be what be the good time to meet the threat and how be the good way to meet it
 the good time to meet the threat be in the beginning it be easy to put out a fire in the beginning when it be small than after it have become a roar blaze and the good way to meet the threat of aggression be for the peace love nation to act together if they do not act together they be likely to be pick off one by one
 if they have follow the right policy in the 1930' if the free country have act together to crush the aggression of the dictator and if they have act in the beginning when the aggression be small there probably would have be no world war ii
 if history have teach we anything it be that aggression anywhere in the world be a threat to the peace everywhere in the world when that aggression be support by the cruel and selfish ruler of a powerful nation who be bent on conquest it become a dear and present danger to the security and independence of every free nation
 this be a lesson that most people in this country have learn thoroughly this be the basic reason why we join in create the united nations and since the end of world war ii we have be put that lesson into practice we have be work with other free nation to check the aggressive design of the soviet union before they can result in a third world war
 that be what we do in greece when that nation be threaten by the aggression of international communism
 the attack against greece could have lead to general war but this country come to the aid of greece the united nations support greek resistance with our help the determination and effort of the greek people defeat the attack on the spot
 another big communist threat to peace be the berlin blockade that too could have lead to war but again it be settle because free man would not back down in an emergency
 the aggression against korea be the bold and most dangerous move the communists have yet make
 the attack on korea be part of a great plan for conquer all of asia
 i would like to read to you from a secret intelligence report which come to we after the attack on korea it be a report of a speech a communist army officer in north korea give to a group of spy and saboteur last may 1 month before south korea be invade the report show in great detail how this invasion be part of a carefully prepare plot here in part be what the communist officer who have be train in moscow tell his man our force he say be schedule to attack south korean force about the middle of june the come attack on south korea mark the first step toward the liberation of asia
 notice that he use the word liberation this be communist double talk meaning conquest
 i have another secret intelligence report here this one tell what another communist officer in the far east tell his man several month before the invasion of korea here be what he say in order to successfully undertake the long await world revolution we must first unify asia lava indochina malaya india tibet thailand philippines and japan be our ultimate target the united states be the only obstacle on our road for the liberation of all the country in southeast asia in other word we must unify the people of asia and crush the united states again liberation in commie language mean conquest
 that be what the communist leader be tell their people and that be what they have be try to do
 they want to control all asia from the kremlin
 this plan of conquest be in flat contradiction to what we believe we believe that korea belong to the koreans we believe that india belong to the indians we believe that all the nation of asia should be free to work out their affair in their own way this be the basis of peace in the far east and it be the basis of peace everywhere else
 the whole communist imperialism be back of the attack on peace in the far east it be the soviet union that train and equip the north koreans for aggression the chinese communists mass 44 well train and well equip division on the korean frontier these be the troop they throw into battle when the north korean communists be beat
 the question we have have to face be whether the communist plan of conquest can be stop without a general war our government and other country associate with we in the united nations believe that the good chance of stop it without a general war be to meet the attack in korea and defeat it there
 that be what we have be do it be a difficult and bitter task
 but so far it have be successful
 so far we have prevent world war iii
 so far by fight a limited war in korea we have prevent aggression from succeed and bring on a general war and the ability of the whole free world to resist communist aggression have be greatly improve
 we have teach the enemy a lesson he have find that aggression be not cheap or easy moreover man all over the world who want to remain free have be give new courage and new hope they know now that the champion of freedom can stand up and fight and that they will stand up and fight
 our resolute stand in korea be help the force of freedom now fight in indochina and other country in that part of the world it have already slow down the timetable of conquest
 in korea itself there be sign that the enemy be build up his ground force for a new mass offensive we also know that there have be large increase in the enemy 's available air force
 if a new attack come i feel confident it will be turn back the united nations fight force be tough and able and well equip they be fight for a just cause they be prove to all the world that the principle of collective security will work we be proud of all these force for the magnificent job they have do against heavy odd we pray that their effort may succeed for upon their success may hinge the peace of the world
 the communist side must now choose its course of action the communist ruler may press the attack against we they may take further action which will spread the conflict they have that choice and with it the awful responsibility for what may follow the communists also have the choice of a peaceful settlement which could lead to a general relaxation of the tension in the far east the decision be theirs because the force of the united nations will strive to limit the conflict if possible
 we do not want to see the conflict in korea extend we be try to prevent a world war not to start one and the good way to do that be to make it plain that we and the other free country will continue to resist the attack
 but you may ask why can not we take other step to punish the aggressor why do not we bomb manchuria and china itself why do not we assist the chinese nationalist troop to land on the mainland of china
 if we be to do these thing we would be run a very grave risk of start a general war if that be to happen we would have bring about the exact situation we be try to prevent
 if we be to do these thing we would become entangled in a vast conflict on the continent of asia and our task would become immeasurably more difficult all over the world
 what would suit the ambition of the kremlin well than for our military force to be commit to a full scale war with red china
 it may well be that in spite of our good effort the communists may spread the war but it would be wrong tragically wrong for we to take the initiative in extend the war
 the danger be great make no mistake about it behind the north koreans and chinese communists in the front line stand additional million of chinese soldier and behind the chinese stand the tank the plane the submarine the soldier and the scheme ruler of the soviet union
 our aim be to avoid the spread of the conflict
 the course we have be follow be the one well calculate to avoid an all out war it be the course consistent with our obligation to do all we can to maintain international peace and security our experience in greece and berlin show that it be the most effective course of action we can follow
 first of all it be clear that our effort in korea can blunt the will of the chinese communists to continue the struggle the united nations force have put up a tremendous fight in korea and have inflict very heavy casualty on the enemy our force be strong now than they have be before these be plain fact which may discourage the chinese communists from continue their attack
 second the free world as a whole be grow in military strength every day in the united states in western europe and throughout the world free man be alert to the soviet threat and be build their defense this may discourage the communist ruler from continue the war in korea and from undertake new act of aggression elsewhere
 if the communist authority realize that they can not defeat we in korea if they realize it would be foolhardy to widen the hostility beyond korea then they may recognize the folly of continue their aggression a peaceful settlement may then be possible the door be always open
 then we may achieve a settlement in korea which will not compromise the principle and purpose of the united nations
 i have think long and hard about this question of extend the war in asia i have discuss it many time with the able military adviser in the country i believe with all my heart that the course we be follow be the good course
 i believe that we must try to limit the war to korea for these vital reason to make sure that the precious life of our fight man be not waste to see that the security of our country and the free world be not needlessly jeopardize and to prevent a third world war
 a number of event have make it evident that general macarthur do not agree with that policy i have therefore consider it essential to relieve general macarthur so that there would be no doubt or confusion as to the real purpose and aim of our policy
 it be with the deep personal regret that i find myself compel to take this action general macarthur be one of our great military commander but the cause of world peace be much more important than any individual
 the change in command in the far east mean no change whatever in the policy of the united states we will carry on the fight in korea with vigor and determination in an effort to bring the war to a speedy and successful conclusion the new commander lt gen. matthew ridgway have already demonstrate that he have the great quality of military leadership need for this task
 we be ready at any time to negotiate for a restoration of peace in the area but we will not engage in appeasement we be only interested in real peace
 real peace can be achieve through a settlement base on the following factor
 one the fighting must stop
 two concrete step must be take to insure that the fighting will not break out again
 three there must be an end to the aggression
 a settlement found upon these element would open the way for the unification of korea and the withdrawal of all foreign force
 in the meantime i want to be clear about our military objective we be fight to resist an outrageous aggression in korea we be try to keep the korean conflict from spread to other area but at the same time we must conduct our military activity so as to insure the security of our force this be essential if they be to continue the fight until the enemy abandon its ruthless attempt to destroy the republic of korea
 that be our military objective to repel attack and to restore peace
 in the hard fighting in korea we be prove that collective action among nation be not only a high principle but a workable mean of resist aggression defeat of aggression in korea may be the turning point in the world 's search for a practical way of achieve peace and security
 the struggle of the united nations in korea be a struggle for peace
 free nation have unite their strength in an effort to prevent a third world war
 that war can come if the communist ruler want it to come but this nation and its ally will not be responsible for its coming
 we do not want to widen the conflict we will use every effort to prevent that disaster and in so do we know that we be follow the great principle of peace freedom and justice

dr. murphy distinguished guest mr. mayor delegate to the 29th annual convention of the columbia scholastic press association
 you know i be very much afraid that you be go to take that admonition of dr. murphy seriously but i be very glad that you didn't when he tell you not to make any noise after the broadcast go on
 i be happy to be with you today it be a pleasure to talk to the young people who run the school paper of this great country of our you probably do not know it but i be a school editor myself once of the high school paper in independence mo. and it be a first edition too charlie ross and four or five other kid and myself get out the first number of the gleam name after the admonition in tennyson 's poem after it follow it follow the gleam
 i have be try to follow it ever since from then on i keep go and you know the trouble that i be in today so you see if you be not very careful you may end up by live in the white house and i say to you that it be a wonderful experience indeed in spite of all its trouble
 all my life i have be interested in the presidency and the way president be choose i remember very well the first presidential nominate convention that i attend it be in kansas city mo. in 1900 when bryan be nominate the second time for the democratic nomination for the presidency i be 16 and i enjoy that convention very much because i think old man bryan be the great orator of the time and i still think so president roosevelt say he be one of the great progressive of our time but he be ahead of his time
 a lot of we be in that condition
 now besides be nominate for the presidency three time mr. bryan become an editor and you know i be very much interested in editor and publisher it be a very great responsibility to be the editor of a great newspaper or a great periodical and we have some wonderfully great magazine and newspaper in this country it be the duty of the editor of those great publication to
 see that the news be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth and these great one do just that
 but we do have among we some publication which do not care very much for the truth in the news and sometimes make propaganda out of it and then write editorial about it but an editorial write on misrepresentation in the news and on propaganda be just as bad as the foundation on which it rest
 i hope that if any of you become editor of great publication and you be now editor of great publication in your sphere that you will stick strictly to the truth and nothing but the truth when you publish the news
 i hear mr. bryan say one time that the first convention he attend be at philadelphia in 1876 and he crawl in through a window and that ever since that time they have be try to put he out over the transom but never have succeed
 the first convention that i attend be the one i refer to in 1900 when i walk into that convention i also later walk into the white house which mr. bryan never do do and i do not know who get the good of it because mr. bryan get his message over just as well as if he have be elect president and i do not know whether i be get mine over or not
 another convention that i remember very well be the one at baltimore when woodrow wilson be nominate i be run a binder around a quarter section of land take 2 mile to make that circuit and at one corner there be a little telegraph station about a quarter mile from where i be work and i would get down and go over to the telegraph station to see how the convention be come on and that be how i find out that woodrow wilson have be nominate do not have any radio or television in those day and we do not have any pollster or false political prophet either
 i vote for wilson that year and i have believe ever since in the policy which he follow he be one of our very great president and i sincerely believe that if we have follow he in what he want to do we would certainly have avoid the second world war i hope that we will not make that same mistake after this last world war
 now i understand that a lot of people be mystify and wonder why i come all the way up here from key west to talk to you today
 the answer be very simple i come because the future of this great republic of ours depend upon young people like you and also for the reason that for the last 7 year young people have be come to see i at the white house there be hardly a week go by that i do not see some delegation of young people who pass through my office and shake hand with i and i usually have a word or two to say to they
 and now i be here and you be in exactly the same position you would be at the white house you would have to listen
 the united states of america be the great republic in the history of the world we want to keep it the great republic it will be up to you young people to do that job in the future
 youth the hope of the world that be the motto on the front door of the high school from which i be graduate only it be write in latin juventus spes mundi i will never forget it i never have forget it and i still think that youth be the hope of the world and that they always will be it be just as true now as it be when i come out of that small town high school it be necessary for the young people to understand the road to be follow if this country be to accomplish the mission which god intend it to accomplish in this world
 i hope i can give you some idea of how to follow that road into tomorrow and the future of the world i hope you will go back to your school and talk about it and discuss it i hope you will write about it in your publication because it be your responsibility as editor to work for the good of your great country and for the future of the world both be in your hand
 now the thing i want to impress upon you be that government must be operate on the basis of the great good for the great number of its citizen that be the fundamental basis of the domestic program and the foreign policy of this government of your and mine no nation be good and can last unless it be build upon our ideal our nation be build upon ideal ideal of unselfishness and respect for the right and welfare of other
 the fundamental basis of this nation 's ideal be give to moses on mount sinai the fundamental basis of the bill of rights of our constitution come from the teaching which we get from exodus st. matthew isaiah and st. paul the sermon on the mount give we a way of life and maybe some day man will understand it as the real way of life the basis of all great moral code be do unto other as you would have other do unto you treat other as you would like to be treat
 some of you may think that such a philosophy as that have no place in politic and government but it be the only philosophy on which you can base a last government government build on that philosophy be build on a rock and will not fail
 when our own government have look after the average man first we have grow and prosper but when those in power have use our government to increase the privilege of the few at the top the life and spirit of our country have decline thank god most of the time we have be on the right road
 in the lifetime of everyone here we have have a chance to see how this work although some of you may not be old enough and i be sure none of you be old enough to remember the great depression in the last 20 year the government of the united states have make great progress in measure to help and protect the average man we have not be ashamed to work for human welfare at home and abroad
 now i just want you to examine the fact and see for yourself what the result have be in well living condition for the american people and in strengthen the base of our democracy more and more people have be able to have well and well living condition in 1939 only one out of four family have an income of more than $ 2,000 in 1949 it be two out of three there be few poor people and more well to do people in this country now than ever before not only in this country but in the history of the world we have be reduce inequality not by pull down those at the top but by lift up those at the bottom
 this great record of progress be the result of our policy of the fair deal under that policy we look out for the other fellow as well as for ourselves that same program apply to our foreign policy we can not isolate ourselves from our neighbor in the rest of the world when something hurt they it hurt we when something help they it help we
 the way to keep our own country strong and prosperous be to encourage and develop prosperity in the rest of the world we can learn a lot from the rest of the world there be many thing that even the people of undeveloped country in the world can teach we we must exchange idea we must exchange good we must exchange friendship
 we be not imperialist we do not want any more territory we do not want to conquer any people or to dominate they the russian propaganda say that we be imperialist and want to conquer the world that just be not true we know the soviet government be a menace to we and to all the free world that be why we be build up our strength not to march against they but to discourage they from march against we and the free world
 we want to help the people in other country to help themselves because that make for prosperity for we all i want you young people to understand that if we accomplish the purpose which we propose to accomplish it mean the great age in the history of the world you will live in the grand and most peaceful time that the world have ever see
 it be up to you to help carry on that purpose it may take more than one generation to accomplish it but we can accomplish it we be go to accomplish it and i know that you will help to accomplish it
 i appreciate again be here may god bless you all

mr. chairman mr. vice president mr. speaker mr. chairman of the democratic committee distinguished guest and fellow democrats
 i be very happy to be here tonight this make seven jefferson jackson dinner that i have speak to in the city of washington i hope to attend several more in one capacity or another
 they have all be wonderful dinner one of the thing i like about the dinner be the fact that they be political meeting i like political meeting and i like politic
 politic good politic be public service there be no life or occupation in which a man can find a great opportunity to serve his community or his country
 i have be in politic more than 30 year and i know that nothing else could have give i great satisfaction i have have a career from precinct to president and i be a little bit proud of that career
 i be sure all of you here tonight be very much interested in the presidential election this year
 in view of that fact i think i would give you a little analysis of the political situation as i see it
 the political situation in this country may look complicated but you can find the key to it in a simple thing the republicans have be out of office for 20 long year and they be desperate to get back in office so they can control the country again
 for 20 year the republicans have be wander in a political desert like camel look for an oasis they do not drink the same thing that camel do though and if they do not find it pretty soon the republican party may die out altogether
 and you know i would just hate to see that happen i would like to help keep the republican party alive if that be at all possible so i be go to offer they a little advice about the error of their way
 there be some very good reason why the republicans have be out of office so long and have not be able to get back in control
 the first reason be that they be vote out in 1932 because they have bring the country to the brink of ruin
 in the 1920 's the republican administration draw back in petrified isolation from our world responsibility they spend all their time try to help the rich get rich and pay no attention to the welfare of the worker and the farmer all in all they pave the way for the big economic smashup this country have ever see
 that be the reason the republicans be throw out of office in 1932 and one of the very good reason why they have be keep out ever since people do not want any more great depression
 the second reason why the republicans have be out of office for 20 year be that the democratic party have be give the country good government instead of try to build up the prosperity of the favor few and let some of it trickle down to the rest we have be work to raise the income of the vast majority of the people and we have be steadily expand the base for prosperity and freedom in this country the people have keep right on reelect democrats because we have be serve they well and they know it
 the third reason the republicans have be keep out of power for an year be because they have never be able to agree on a sensible program to put before the country they have be on almost every side of every question but they have seldom or never be on the right side
 in 1936 they say the new deal be terrible and they be against it and all its work and in the election that fall they just lose by a landslide
 in 1940 they admit there might be some good in some part of the new deal but they say you need a republican to run it and they be overwhelmingly beat again
 in 1944 the republicans say the new deal might have be good in its day but it have get old and tired and it be no good any more but the people do not agree and the republicans be snow under once more
 now in 1948 they say well as a matter of fact by 1948 they be so sure of win that they really do not bother to take a position on anything and they get just exactly what they deserve they get another good licking
 and by now the republicans can not figure out what to do every day you hear a new republican theory of how to win the election of 1952
 one theory they have be that they ought to come right out and say they be against all advance the country have make since 1932
 this be the kind of dinosaur school of republican strategy they want to go back to prehistoric time republican of this school say let us stop beat about the bush and let us say what we really believe let us say we be against social security and we be against the labor union and good wage and we be opposed to price support for farmer that we be against the government do anything for anybody except big business
 now i have a lot of sympathy for these republicans they have be hush up for a long time they would certainly be happy if they could tell the truth for once and campaign for what they really believe it would be good for their soul but it would not be good for their party or for the country either this dinosaur school of republican strategy would only get the dinosaur vote and there be not many of they leave except over at the smithsonian
 next there be the republican theory that the republicans can win if they oppose the foreign policy of the united states they can not agree among themselves as to how they want to oppose it but most of they want to oppose it somehow
 some republicans seem to think it would be popular to pull out of korea and to abandon europe and to let the united nations go to smash they reason this way the american people be not very bright let us tell they they do not have to build up defense or serve in the army or strengthen our ally overseas if they fall for that then we republicans will be in and that be all that matter
 the trouble with the republican theory be that the american people be a lot smart than the republicans who think it up the american people have learn a lot from two world war and from the last 7 year of work to keep the peace they know that as long as communism be loose in the world we must have ally and we must resist aggression the american people be live in the atomic age and they know that the idea of the stone age will not work any more if they ever do work
 and there be another group of republicans who attack our foreign policy by advocate the all out or let us get it over with theory these be the republicans who say they want to expand the fighting in korea and start drop atomic bomb and invite a new world war they figure it be good politic to talk that way they do not stop to count the cost they think people do not understand that the hard and brave thing in the world be to work for peace and not for war but if war come and god forbid that it come if the showdown come these loud talker would be the first people to run for the bomb shelter and the voter know it
 none of these republican theory of how to win the election hold much promise of success this year all they show be that the platform that the republicans write in chicago in july will have to be a fearful and wonderful thing to cover all these different theory it will have to be a big tent than the ringling brothers circus and it will have to cover just about as many freak it have even become fashionable for the republican candidate to saw themselves in half and put part on each side of the fence that would fit under the tent too
 the real republican campaign be not go to be fight on the issue the republicans be go to wage a campaign of phony propaganda they be go to try what we might call the white be black and the black be white strategy the reasoning behind it be this the republicans know that the nation be strong and prosperous that we be build up defense against communism that the democratic administration have work for the good of the people the only chance for the republicans therefore be to make the people think the fact be not so the job for the republicans be to make people believe that white be black and black be white
 this be a pretty difficult way to win an election it would not appeal to anybody but very desperate republican politician but the republicans have some reason for think it might succeed they will have the support of most of the press and most of the radio commentator and they may have the professional poll taker with they again as they be in 1948 the republicans as always will have a lot of money they have slick advertising expert and they do not have too many scruple about how they use they remember that carpetbagger from chicago who get convict for the way he elect a republican senator in maryland in 1950 they will try that all over the country
 the republicans be all set to try this white be black technique and this be the way it will work first of all they will try to make people believe that everything the government have do for the country be socialism they will go to the people and say do you see that social security check you receive the other day you think that be good for you do not you that be just too bad that be nothing in the world but socialism do you see that new flood control dam the government be build over there for the protection of your property sorry that be awful socialism that new hospital that they be build be socialism price support more socialism for the farmer minimum wage law socialism for labor socialism be bad for you my friend everybody know that and here you be with your new car and your home and well opportunity for the kid and a television set you be just surround by socialism
 now the republicans say that be a terrible thing my friend and the only way out of this sinkhole of socialism be to vote for the republican ticket
 and if you do that you will probably have a garage and no car a crystal radio set and no television and probably not even a garage to live in but a secondhand tent out on the lawn i do not believe people be go to be fool into that condition because they go through it once before
 now do you think they can sell that bill of good this country today have more freedom for all its people than any country in the history of the world and all the effort of all the republican politician can not convince the people that this be socialism
 the next part of this white be black campaign be to try to make people believe that the democratic party be in favor of communism that be an even tough job than sell the socialism nonsense but the republicans be desperate so they be go to try it
 of course we have spend billion of dollar to build up our defense against communism we have create an alliance of the free nation against communism we be help they to arm against communism we have meet and halt communism in greece and turkey in berlin and austria in italy and iran and the most important of all in korea we have fight communism abroad we have fight communism at home we have an fbi and a central intelligence agency defend we against spy and saboteur the federal loyalty program keep communists out of government
 that be the record and how do the republicans propose to get around it here be what they will try to do they will go to the voter and say do you know the government be full of communists and the voter say no what make you say that and then the republicans explain that somebody name joe doakes work for the government and he have a cousin who sell shoelace or a ribbon clerk in a department store and this cousin have a wife who write an article before joe marry she that be print in a magazine that also print an article in favor of chinese communists and they will continue that ad lib this may sound very silly and it be but some political faker spend all their time try to pull the wool over the people 's eye with this sort of nonsense
 the real test of anti communism be whether we be willing to devote our resource and our strength to stop communist aggression and save free people from its horrible tyranny this kind of anti communism take money and courage and not just a lot of talk the next time you hear some of this loud anti communist talk from our republican friend ask they how they vote ask they how they vote on aid to greece ask they how they vote on the marshall plan ask they how they vote on the mutual security program the chance be they vote to cut or cripple these all important measure against communism
 i say to you in all seriousness beware of those who pretend to be so violently anti communist in this country and at the same time vote to appease communism abroad in my book that be talk out of both side of the mouth at once and i do not think the american people be go to be take in by it
 the next part of the republican white be black campaign be to try to fool the voter into think that the democratic party be dishonest that the government be full of grafter and thief and all kind of assorted crook to hear they talk you would not think that there be an honest man in washington and that include some of they too maybe
 now i want to say something very important to you about this issue of morality in government
 i stand for honest government i have work for it i have probably do more for it than any other president i have do more than any other president to reorganize the government on an efficient basis and to extend the civil service merit system
 i hate corruption not only because it be bad in itself but also because it be the deadly enemy of all thing the democratic party have be do all these year i hate corruption everywhere but i hate it most of all in a democratic officeholder because that be a betrayal of all that the democratic party stand for
 here be the reason to i morality in government mean more than a mere absence of wrongdoing it mean a government that be fair to all i think it be just as immoral for the congress to enact special tax favor into law as it be for a tax official to connive in a crooked tax return it be just as immoral to use the lawmaking power of the government to enrich the few at the expense of the many as it be to steal money from the public treasury that be steal money from the public treasury
 all of we know of course about the scandal and corruption of the republican officeholder in the 1920 's but to my mind the veterans administration scandal in those day and the teapot dome steal be no bad no more immoral than the tax law of andrew mellon or the attempt to sell muscle shoals to private owner legislation that favor the greed of monopoly and the trickery of wall street be a form of corruption that do the country four time as much harm as teapot dome ever do
 private selfish interest be always try to corrupt the government in this way powerful financial group be always try to get favor for themselves
 now the democratic administration have be fight against these effort to corrupt the power of government we have not always win but we have never surrender and we never will
 for all these year we have be fight to use our natural resource for the benefit of the public to develop our forest and our public oil reserve and our water power for the benefit of all to raise the income of all our citizen to protect the farmer and the worker against the power of monopoly
 and where have the republicans be in this fight for morality in government do they come out and vote with we to keep the special interest from rob the public not at all most of they be on the other side
 it be the same thing when you come to the question of the conduct of government official the republicans make a great whoop and holier about the honesty of federal employee but they be usually the first to show up in a government office ask for special favor for private interest and in raise cain if they do not get they these republican gentleman can not have it both way they can not be for morality on tuesday and thursday and then be for special privilege for their client on monday wednesday and friday
 the press recently for a wonder have be give some fact on this subject that have be very hard to get at
 i be disgusted with these effort to discredit and blacken the character and reputation of the whole federal service we have a high percentage of federal employee under civil service than ever before and on the whole they be a finer well type of man and woman than we have ever have in the service before it be just as much our duty to protect the innocent as it be to punish the guilty if a man be accuse he ought to have his day in court and i do not mean a kangaroo court either
 i hate injustice just as much as i hate corruption
 of course we must always work to keep our government clean our democratic senators and congressmen have be work and i have be work to clean up bad condition where they exist and to devise procedure and system to prevent they in the future and i would like to have help in this fight from everybody democrats and republicans alike i have just get one reorganization plan through the congress and i be go to send up some more plan to the congress soon to put more of our federal official under civil service and out of politic i would like to see how many of the republicans vote for they
 i do not think the black be white campaign of the republican party be go to succeed i think the voter be go to see through this holy than thou disguise that our republican friend be put on
 all the trick of republican propaganda can not make the people forget that the democratic party have be work for their welfare
 we be work for the welfare of the farmer we hold to the ideal that go back to jefferson that a farmer should have the opportunity to own his farm to share in the benefit of scientific progress and to secure a fair income for his effort
 the democratic party be work for the success of our free enterprise system we have work to prevent monopoly to give the small businessman a fair chance and to develop our natural resource for all the people and not just for the favor few
 the democratic party be work for the welfare of labor we have work for good wage and hour legislation for unemployment compensation and for fair labor relation law
 the democratic party be dedicate to the ideal that every family be entitle to fair opportunity for decent living condition to a chance to educate their child to have good medical service and reasonable provision for retirement that be why we have work for good social security law for well education and health service for good housing and for equal right and opportunity for all our people regardless of color religion or national origin
 above all the democratic party be work for peace on earth and goodwill among man we believe that war be not inevitable that peace can be win that free man of all land can find the way to live together in the world as good neighbor that be why we have be willing to sacrifice to stop aggression willing to send our money and our good to help man in other country stand up against tyranny willing to fight in korea to stop world war iii before it begin for if the bloody harvest of world war be to begin anew most of we would never see a peaceful world again
 this be the record of the democratic party it be a proud record and an honorable record it be a record of progress of action that be right because they be solidly found on american ideal
 whoever the democrats nominate for president this year he will have this record to run upon
 i shall not be a candidate for reelection i have serve my country long and i think efficiently and honestly i shall not accept a renomination i do not feel that it be my duty to spend another 4 year in the white house
 we must always remember the thing the democratic party have do and the high ideal that have make it great we must be true to its principle and keep it foremost in service of the people
 if we do that we can be sure that there will be a democratic president in the white house for the next 4 year

my fellow americans
 i come before you tonight as a candidate for the vice presidency and as a man whose honesty and integrity have be question
 the usual political thing to do when charge be make against you be to either ignore they or to deny they without give detail
 i believe we have have enough of that in the united states particularly with the present administration in washington d.c. to i the office of the vice presidency of the united states be a great office and i feel that the people have get to have confidence in the integrity of the man who run for that office and who might obtain it
 i have a theory too that the good and only answer to a smear or to an honest misunderstanding of the fact be to tell the truth and that be why i be here tonight i want to tell you my side of the case
 i be sure that you have read the charge and you have hear that i senator nixon take $ 18,000 from a group of my supporter
 now be that wrong and let i say that it be wrong i'm say incidentally that it be wrong and not just illegal because it be not a question of whether it be legal or illegal that be not enough the question be be it morally wrong
 i say that it be morally wrong if any of that $ 18,000 go to senator nixon for my personal use i say that it be morally wrong if it be secretly give and secretly handle and i say that it be morally wrong if any of the contributor get special favor for the contribution that they make
 and now to answer those question let i say this
 not one cent of the $ 18,000 or any other money of that type ever go to i for my personal use every penny of it be use to pay for political expense that i do not think should be charge to the taxpayer of the united states
 it be not a secret fund as a matter of fact when i be on meet the press some of you may have see it last sunday peter edson come up to i after the program and he say dick what about this fund we hear about and i say well there be no secret about it go out and see dana smith who be the administrator of the fund
 and i give he his address and i say that you will find that the purpose of the fund simply be to defray political expense that i do not feel should be charge to the government
 and third let i point out and i want to make this particularly clear that no contributor to this fund no contributor to any of my campaign have ever receive any consideration that he would not have receive as an ordinary constituent
 i just do not believe in that and i can say that never while i have be in the senate of the united states as far as the people that contribute to this fund be concern have i make a telephone call for they to an agency or have i go down to an agency in their behalf and the record will show that the record which be in the hand of the administration
 but then some of you will say and rightly well what do you use the fund for senator why do you have to have it
 let i tell you in just a word how a senate office operate first of all a senator get $ 15,000 a year in salary he get enough money to pay for one trip a year a round trip that be for himself and his family between his home and washington d.c.
 and then he get an allowance to handle the people that work in his office to handle his mail and the allowance for my state of california be enough to hire thirteen people
 and let i say incidentally that that allowance be not pay to the senator it be pay directly to the individual that the senator put on his payroll but all of these people and all of these allowance be for strictly official business business for example when a constituent write in and want you to go down to the veterans administration and get some information about his gi policy item of that type for example
 but there be other expense which be not cover by the government and i think i can well discuss those expense by ask you some question
 do you think that when i or any other senator make a political speech have it print should charge the printing of that speech and the mailing of that speech to the taxpayer do you think for example when i or any other senator make a trip to his home state to make a purely political speech that the cost of that trip should be charge to the taxpayer do you think when a senator make political broadcast or political television broadcast radio or television that the expense of those broadcast should be charge to the taxpayer
 well i know what your answer be it be the same answer that audience give i whenever i discuss this particular problem the answer be no the taxpayer should not be require to finance item which be not official business but which be primarily political business
 but then the question arise you say well how do you pay for l these and how can you do it legally and there be several way that it can be do incidentally and that it be do legally in the united states senate and in the congress
 the first way be to be a rich man i do not happen to be a rich man so i could not use that one
 another way that be use be to put your wife on the payroll let i say incidentally my opponent my opposite number for the vice presidency on the democratic ticket do have his wife on the payroll and have have she on his payroll for the ten year the past ten year
 now just let i say this that be his business and i be not critical of he for do that you will have to pass judgment on that particular point but i have never do that for this reason i have find that there be so many deserve stenographer and secretary in washington that need the work that i just do not feel it be right to put my wife on the payroll
 my wife 's sit over here she be a wonderful stenographer she use to teach stenography and she use to teach shorthand in high school that be when i meet she and i can tell you folk that she be work many hour at night and many hour on saturdays and sundays in my office and she be do a fine job and i be proud to say tonight that in the six year i have be in the house and the senate of the united states pat nixon have never be on the government payroll
 there be other way that these finance can be take care of some who be lawyer and i happen to be a lawyer continue to practice law but i have not be able to do that i be so far away from california that i have be so busy with my senatorial work that i have not engage in any legal practice
 and also as far as law practice be concern it seem to i that the relationship between an attorney and the client be 80 personal that you could not possibly represent a man as an attorney and then have an unbiased view when he present his case to you in the event that he have one before the government
 and so i feel that the good way to handle these necessary political expense of get my message to the american people and the speech i make the speech that i have print for the most part concern this one message of expose this administration the communism in it the corruption in it the only way that i could do that be to accept the aid which people in my home state of california who contribute to my campaign and who continue to make these contribution after i be elect be glad to make
 and let i say i be proud of the fact that not one of they have ever ask i for a special favor i be proud of the fact that not one of they have ever ask i to vote on a bill other than as my own conscience would dictate and i be proud of the fact that the taxpayer by subterfuge or otherwise have never pay one dime for expense which i think be political and should not be charge to the taxpayer
 let i say incidentally that some of you may say well that be all right senator that be your explanation but have you get any proof7
 and i would like to tell you this evening that just about an hour ago we receive an independent audit of this entire fund i suggest to gov. sherman adams who be the chief of staff of the dwight eisenhower campaign that an independent audit and legal report be obtain and i have that audit here in my hand
 it be an audit make by the price waterhouse amp co. firm and the legal opinion by gibson dunn amp crutcher lawyer in los angeles the big law firm and incidentally one of the good one in los angeles
 i be proud to be able to report to you tonight that this audit and this legal opinion be be forward to general eisenhower and i would like to read to you the opinion that be prepare by gibson dunn amp crutcher and base on all the pertinent law and statute together with the audit report prepare by the certify public accountant
 it be our conclusion that senator nixon do not obtain any financial gain from the collection and disbursement of the fund by dana smith that senator nixon do not violate any federal or state law by reason of the operation of the fund and that neither the portion of the fund pay by dana smith directly to third person nor the portion pay to senator nixon to reimburse he for designated office expense constitute income to the senator which be either reportable or taxable as income under applicable tax law sign gibson dunn amp crutcher by alma h. conway
 now that my friend be not nixon speaking but that be an independent audit which be request because i want the american people to know all the fact and i be not afraid of have independent people go in and check the fact and that be exactly what they do
 but then i realize that there be still some who may say and rightly so and let i say that i recognize that some will continue to smear regardless of what the truth may be but that there have be understandably some honest misunderstanding on this matter and there be some that will say
 well maybe you be able senator to fake this thing how can we believe what you say after all be there a possibility that maybe you get some sum in cash be there a possibility that you may have feather your own nest and so now what i be go to do and incidentally this be unprecedented in the history of american politic i be go at this time to give this television and radio audience a complete financial history everything i have earn everything i have spend everything i owe and i want you to know the fact i will have to start early
 i be bear in 1913 our family be one of modest circumstance and most of my early life be spend in a store out in east whittier it be a grocery store one of those family enterprise he only reason we be able to make it go be because my mother and dad have five boy and we all work in the store
 i work my way through college and to a great extent through law school and then in 1940 probably the good thing that ever happen to i happen i marry pat who be sit over here we have a rather difficult time after we be marry like so many of the young couple who may be listen to we i practice law she continue to teach school then in 1942 i go into the service
 let i say that my service record be not a particularly unusual one i go to the south pacific i guess i be entitle to a couple of battle star i get a couple of letter of commendation but i be just there when the bomb be fall and then i return i return to the united states and in 1946 i run for the congress
 when we come out of the war pat and i pat during the war ad work as a stenographer and in a bank and as an economist for government agency and when we come out the total of our saving from both my law practice her teaching and all the time that i as in the war the total for that entire period be just a little less than $ 10,000 every cent of that incidentally be in government bond
 well that be where we start when i go into politic now what i have i earn since i go into politic well here it be i jot it down let i read the note first of all i have have my salary as a congressman and as a senator second i have receive a total in this past six year of $ 1600 from estate which be in my law firm the time that i sever my connection with it
 and incidentally as i say before i have not engage in any legal practice and have not accept any fee from business that come to the firm after i go into politic i have make an average of approximately $ 1500 a year from nonpolitical speaking engagement and lecture and then fortunately we have inherit a little money pat sell her interest in her father 's estate for $ 3,000 and i inherit $ l500 from my grandfather
 we live rather modestly for four year we live in an apartment in park fairfax in alexandria va. the rent be $ 80 a month and we save for the time that we could buy a house
 now that be what we take in what do we do with this money what do we have today to show for it this will surprise you because it be so little i suppose as standard generally go of people in public life first of all we have get a house in washington which cost $ 41,000 and on which we owe $ 20,000 we have a house in whittier california which cost $ 13,000 and on which we owe $ 3000 my folk be live there at the present time
 i have just $ 4,000 in life insurance plus my g.i. policy which i have never be able to convert and which will run out in two year i have no insurance whatever on pat i have no life insurance on our our youngster patricia and julie i own a 1950 oldsmobile car we have our furniture we have no stock and bond of any type we have no interest of any kind direct or indirect in any business
 now that be what we have what do we owe well in addition to the mortgage the $ 20,000 mortgage on the house in washington the $ 10,000 one on the house in whittier i owe $ 4,500 to the riggs bank in washington d.c. with interest 4 1/2 per cent
 i owe $ 3,500 to my parent and the interest on that loan which i pay regularly because it be the part of the saving they make through the year they be work so hard i pay regularly 4 per cent interest and then i have a $ 500 loan which i have on my life insurance
 well that be about it that be what we have and that be what we owe it be not very much but pat and i have the satisfaction that every dime that we have get be honestly ours i should say this that pat do not have a mink coat but she do have a respectable republican cloth coat and i always tell she that she would look good in anything
 one other thing i probably should tell you because if we do not they will probably be say this about i too we do get something a gift after the election a man down in texas hear pat on the radio mention the fact that our two youngster would like to have a dog and believe it or not the day before we leave on this campaign trip we get a message from union station in baltimore say they have a package for we we go down to get it you know what it be
 it be a little cocker spaniel dog in a crate that he have send all the way from texas black and white spot and our little girl tricia the 6 year old name it checkers and you know the kid like all kid love the dog and i just want to say this right now that regardless of what they say about it we be go to keep it
 it be not easy to come before a nation wide audience and air your life as i have do but i want to say some thing before i conclude that i think most of you will agree on mr. mitchell the chairman of the democratic national committee make the statement that if a man could not afford to be in the united states senate he should not run for the senate
 and i just want to make my position clear i do not agree with mr. mitchell when he say that only a rich man should serve his government in the united states senate or in the congress i do not believe that represent the thinking of the democratic party and i know that it do not represent the thinking of the republican party
 i believe that it be fine that a man like governor stevenson who inherit a fortune from his father can run for president but i also feel that it be essential in this country of ours that a man of modest mean can also run for president because you know remember abraham lincoln you remember what he say god must have love the common people he make so many of they
 and now i be go to suggest some course of conduct first of all you have read in the paper about other fund now mr. stevenson apparently have a couple one of they in which a group of business people pay and help to supplement the salary of state employee here be where the money go directly into their pocket
 and i think that what mr. stevenson should do be come before the american people as i have give the name of the people that have contribute to that fund give the name of the people who put this money into their pocket at the same time that they be receive money from their state government and see what favor if any they ave out for that
 i do not condemn mr. stevenson for what he do but until the fact be in there be a doubt that will be raise
 and as far as mr. sparkman be concern i would suggest the same thing he be have his wife on the payroll i do not condemn he for that but i think that he should come before the american people and indicate what outside source of income he have have
 i would suggest that under the circumstance both mr. parkman and mr. stevenson should come before the american people as i have and make a complete financial statement as to their financial history and if they do not it will be an admission that they have something to hide and i think that you will agree with i
 because folk remember a man that be to be president of the united states a man that be to be vice president of the united states must have the confidence of all the people and that be why i be do what i be do and that be why i suggest that mr. stevenson and mr. sparkman since they be under attack should do what i be do
 now let i say this i know that this be not the last of the smear in spite of my explanation tonight other smear will be make other have be make in the past and the purpose of the mear i know be this to silence i to make i let up
 well they just do not know who they be deal with i be go l tell you this i remember in the dark day of the hiss case some of the same columnist some of the same radio commentator who be attack i now and misrepresent my position be violently oppose i at the time i be after alger hiss
 but i continue the fight because i know i be right and i an say to this great television and radio audience that i have no pologie to the american people for my part in put alger hiss vhere he be today
 and as far as this be concern i intend to continue the fight
 why do i feel so deeply why do i feel that in spite of the mear the misunderstanding the necessity for a man to come up here and bare his soul as i have why be it necessary for i to continue this fight
 and i want to tell you why because you see i love my country and i think my country be in danger and i think that the only man that can save america at this time be the man that be run for president on my ticket dwight eisenhower
 you say why do i think it be in danger and i say look at the record seven year of the truman acheson administration and that be happen six hundred million people lose to the communists and a war in korea in which we have lose 117,000 american casualty
 and i say to all of you that a policy that result in a loss of six hundred million people to the communists and a war which cost we 117,000 american casualty be not good enough for america
 and i say that those in the state department that make the mistake which cause that war and which result in those loss should be kick out of the state department just as fast as we can get them out of there
 and let i say that i know mr. stevenson will not do that because he defend the truman policy and i know that dwight eisenhower will do that and that he will give america the leadership that it need
 take the problem of corruption you have read about the mess in washington mr. stevenson can not clean it up because he be pick by the man truman under whose administration the mess be make you would not trust a man who make the mess to clean it up that be truman and by the same token you can not trust the man who be pick by the man that make the mess to clean it up and that be stevenson
 and so i say eisenhower who owe nothing to truman nothing to the big city boss he be the man that can clean up the mess in washington
 take communism i say that as far as that subject be concern the danger be great to america in the hiss case they get the secret which enable they to break the american secret state department code they get secret in the atomic bomb case which enable they to get the secret of the atomic bomb five year before they would have get it by their own device
 and i say that any man who call the alger hiss case a red herring be not fit to be president of the united states i say that a man who like mr. stevenson have pooh poohe and ridicule the communist threat in the united states he say that they be phantom among ourselves he be accuse we that have attempt to expose the communists of look for communists in the bureau of fisheries and wildlife i say that a man who say that be not qualified to be president of the united states
 and i say that the only man who can lead we in this fight to rid the government of both those who be communists and those who have corrupt this government be eisenhower because eisenhower you can be sure recognize the problem and he know how to deal with it
 now let i say that finally this evening i want to read to you just briefly excerpt from a letter which i receive a letter which after all this be over no one can take away from we it read as follow
 dear senator nixon
 since i be only 19 year of age i can not vote in this presidential election but believe i if i could you and general eisenhower would certainly get my vote my husband be in the fleet marines in korea he be a corpsman on the front line and we have a two month old son he be never see and i feel confident that with great americans like you and general eisenhower in the white house lonely americans like myself will be unite with their love one now in korea
 i only pray to god that you will not be too late enclosed be a small check to help you in your campaign live on $ 85 a month it be all i can afford at present but let i know what else i can do
 folk it be a check for $ 10 and it be one that i will never cash
 and just let i say this we hear a lot about prosperity these day but i say why can not we have prosperity build on peace rather than prosperity build on war why can not we have prosperity and an honest government in washington d.c. at the same time believe i we can and eisenhower be the man that can lead this crusade to bring we that kind of prosperity
 and now finally i know that you wonder whether or not i be go to stay on the republican ticket or resign
 let i say this i do not believe that i ought to quit because i be not a quitter and incidentally pat be not a quitter after all her name be patricia ryan and she be bear on st. patrick 's day and you know the irish never quit
 but the decision my friend be not mine i would do nothing that would harm the possibility of dwight eisenhower to become president of the united states and for that reason i be submit to the republican national committee tonight through this television broadcast the decision which it be theirs to make
 let they decide whether my position on the ticket will help or hurt and i be go to ask you to help they decide wire and write the republican national committee whether you think i should stay on or whether i should get off and whatever their decision be i will abide by it
 but just let i say this last word regardless of what happen i be go to continue this fight i be go to campaign up and down america until we drive the crook and the communists and those that defend they out of washington and remember folk eisenhower be a great man believe i he be a great man and a vote for eisenhower be a vote for what be good for america

i be more than happy to be with you here today i remember very well that wonderful reception you give i when i be here in 1948 i appreciate that and i also appreciate the way johnstown vote i want you to do as well or well for adlai stevenson will not you do that for i
 i have be go around the country tell the people the fact and the truth about what be at stake in this election i think it be one of the most important we have have in fact i think it be the most important since the civil war i have be point out the real and the essential difference between the two party the democratic party have a heart for the plain everyday people of the country that be what franklin roosevelt 's new deal be all about and that be what harry truman 's fair deal be all about
 the republican party on the other hand be the servant of the big bank big industry the real estate lobby the oil lobby and the rest of that crew with they profit come first ahead of the people
 and you know the reason you have to be so careful in this election they have the oil lobby and the real estate lobby and the china lobby and the national association of manufacturers and the only man in washington who represent all the people and be elect by all the people and who be the people 's lobbyist be the president of the united states so you will have to be mighty careful who you put in there
 these special interest these special lobby have fight the new deal and the fair deal from the beginning they be fight still and they will go back on all the progress we have make if you be foolish enough to give they a chance that be not what they be tell you now during this campaign but it be the way they have be vote in the congress
 of course there be a whole generation of young people now who do not remember much about what happen to this country the last time the republicans run the national government well anybody who can not remember have well ask and find out because the same thing may happen again if you let they into power this time there be a lot of people here who know exactly what it be like
 i be tell that in the bethlehem plant here at johnstown the mill be 8 mile long i be also tell that from 1930 to 1934 no smoke come from even one of the hundred of stack in all those mile of mill
 now they will tell you that that just happen well why be it that they have be expand and grow and have people work at job i will tell you why it be because we have a change of administration that have a heart for the people
 i be tell at that same time that twothird of the home in cambria county be up for sale for delinquent taxis 20 year ago condition be just that desperate all over the country it be not confine to your place in this county in this city
 now any time i mention the great depression the republicans yell that we be just run against herbert hoover well for one thing they keep bring he up it be not our idea it be not our idea at all they have he turn up at their republican convention to remind everybody that he be still a power in the republican party we do not take he there
 and for another thing the republican record in congress during all the year since hoover 's time show they have not learn a thing and probably will act as they do before and just like he do if they get in again
 they be the people who vote against social security they vote against housing they vote against rent control they vote against minimum wage they be the people who vote for taft hartley and for the labor injunction in the steel case they be the people that want to take over the government that be the reason i be go around the country try to remind the people to do a little thinking for themselves and it be not 1932 when they do these thing it be 1946 it be 1947 it be 1949 and even 1952
 you know you ought to read the fine print in the congressional record and find out how these bird behave when they think you do not know what they be do and then you will know what to do the republicans never have look after the interest of the common people and they never will no matter what their five star candidate may tell you at election time it be clear by now that any relation between what he say about the republican party and its actual record be just purely coincidental
 it be not necessary to pour it on all that be necessary for i to do be to tell you the truth and get you to think a little bit sign like that young man be wear give them hell harry"—i do not have to give them hell it be a lot bad for i to tell the truth on them because they can not stand the truth
 now you people be intelligent you be a cross section of this united states of america you be educate you understand the english language you understand what word mean when they be put together in a proper way i want you to read the democratic platform the democratic platform say exactly what the democratic party stand for it say exactly what we have do and what we hope to do
 then i want you to read the republican platform and if you can make anything out of it but gobbledegook i will pay for lie it be about the lousy platform that have ever be present to this country of intelligent people to expect they to support it then they go around and tell you what they be go to do and how they love you and they have be for this and that and what they will do in the future
 but i be ask you to read the republican platform and read the fine print in the congressional record and see how these bird vote and then you can not do anything else but use your head if you do that you will vote for the welfare of the free world you will vote for the welfare of the free world and the great nation in the history of the world be the leader of the free world that be the united states of america
 then you will vote for the interest of this great country which be your interest then you will look after yourself you will remember what happen you will remember 1932 and you will also remember that awful do nothing good for nothing both congress that i put under the sod in 1948
 and if you do that then my trip around the country have not be in vain i be try to wake you up to just think to think in your own interest and when you do that on november the 4th you will go to the poll and you will send adlai stevenson to the white house and we will have 4 more year of good government and prosperity

 of course for more than 3 year mrs. truman and i be not live in the white house we be across the street in the blair house that be when the white house almost fall down on we and have to be rebuild i have a study over at the blair house too but live in the blair house be not as convenient as live in the white house the secret service would not let i walk across the street so i have to get in a car every morning to cross the street to the white house office again at noon to go to the blair house for lunch again to go back to the office after lunch and finally take an automobile at night to return to the blair house fantastic be not it but necessary so my guard think and they be the boss on such matter as that
 now of course we be back in the white house it be in very good condition and general eisenhower will be able to take up his residence in the house and work right here that will be much more convenient for he and i be very glad the renovation job be all complete before his term begin
 your new president be take office in quite different circumstance than when i become president 8 year ago on april 1945 i have be preside over the senate in my capacity as vice president when the senate recess about 5 o'clock in the afternoon i walk over to the office of the speaker of the house mr. rayburn to discuss pende legislation as soon as i arrive i be tell that mr. early one of president roosevelt 's secretary want i to call i reach mr. early and he tell i to come to the white house as quickly as possible to enter by way of the pennsylvania avenue entrance and to come to mrs. roosevelt 's study
 when i arrive mrs. roosevelt tell i the tragic news and i feel the shock that all of you feel a little later when the word come over the radio and appear in the newspaper president roosevelt have die i offer to do anything i could for mrs. roosevelt and then i ask the secretary of state to call the cabinet together
 at 7:09 p.m. i be swear in as president by chief justice stone in the cabinet room
 thing be happen fast in those day the san francisco conference to organize the united nations have be call for april 25th i be ask if that meeting would go forward i announce that it would that be my first decision
 after attend president roosevelt 's funeral i go to the hall of the house of representatives and tell a joint session of the congress that i would carry on president roosevelt 's policy
 on may 7th germany surrender the announcement be make on may 8th my 61st birthday
 mr. churchill call i shortly after that and want a meeting with i and prime minister stalin of russia later on a meeting be agree upon and churchill stalin and i meet at potsdam in germany
 meanwhile the first atomic explosion take place out in the new mexico desert
 the war against japan be still go on i make the decision that the atomic bomb have to be use to end it i make that decision in the conviction it would save hundred of thousand of life japanese as well as american japan surrender and we be face with the huge problem of bring the troop home and reconvert the economy from war to peace
 all these thing happen within just a little over 4 month from april to august 1945 i tell you this to illustrate the tremendous scope of the work your president have to do
 and all these emergency and all the development to meet they have require the president to put in long hour usually 17 hour a day with no payment for overtime i sign my name on the average 600 time a day see and talk to hundred of people every month shake hand with thousand every year and still carry on the business of the large going concern in the whole world there be no job like it on the face of the earth in the power which be concentrate here at this desk and in the responsibility and difficulty of the decision
 i want all of you to realize how big a job how hard a job it be not for my sake because i be step out of it but for the sake of my successor he need the understanding and the help of every citizen it be not enough for you to come out once every 4 year and vote for a candidate and then go back home and say well i have do my part now let the new president do the worrying he can not do the job alone
 regardless of your politic whether you be republican or democrat your fate be tie up with what be do here in this room the president be president of the whole country we must give he our support as citizen of the united states he will have mine and i want you to give he your
 i suppose that history will remember my term in office as the year when the cold war begin to overshadow our life i have have hardly a day in office that have not be dominate by this all embrace struggle this conflict between those who love freedom and those who would lead the world back into slavery and darkness and always in the background there have be the atomic bomb
 but when history say that my term of office see the beginning of the cold war it will also say that in those 8 year we have set the course that can win it we have succeed in carve out a new set of policy to attain peace positive policy policy of world leadership policy that express faith in other free people we have avert world war iii up to now and we may already have succeed in establish condition which can keep that war from happen as far ahead as man can see
 these be great and historic achievement that we can all be proud of think of the difference between our course now and our course 30 year ago after the first world war we withdraw from world affair we fail to act in concert with other people against aggression we help to kill the league of nations and we build up tariff barrier that strangle world trade this time we avoid those mistake we help to found and sustain the united nations we have weld alliance that include the great part of the free world and we have go ahead with other free country to help build their economy and link we all together in a healthy world trade
 think back for a moment to the 1930 's and you will see the difference the japanese move into manchuria and free man do not act the fascists move into ethiopia and we do not act the nazis march into the rhineland into austria into czechoslovakia and free man be paralyze for lack of strength and unity and will
 think about those year of weakness and indecision and the world war ii which be their evil result then think about the speed and courage and decisiveness with which we have move against the communist threat since world war ii
 the first crisis come in 1945 and 1946 when the soviet union refuse to honor its agreement to remove its troop from iran member of my cabinet come to i and ask if we be ready to take the risk that a firm stand involve i reply that we be so we take our stand we make it clear to the soviet union that we expect they to honor their agreement and the soviet troop be withdraw from iran
 then in early 1947 the soviet union threaten greece and turkey the british send i a message say they could no long keep their force in that area something have to be do at once or the eastern mediterranean would be take over by the communists on march 12th i go before the congress and state our determination to help the people of greece and turkey maintain their independence today greece be still free and independent and turkey be a bulwark of strength at a strategic corner of the world
 then come the marshall plan which save europe the heroic berlin airlift and our military aid program
 we inaugurate the north atlantic pact the rio pact bind the western hemisphere together and the defense pact with country of the far pacific
 most important of all we act in korea i be in independence missouri in june 1950 when secretary acheson telephone i and give i the news about the invasion of korea i tell the secretary to lay the matter at once before the united nations and i come on back to washington
 fly back over the flatland of the middle west and over the appalachians that summer afternoon i have a lot of time to think i turn the problem over in my mind in many way but my thought keep come back to the 1930' to manchuria to ethiopia the rhineland austria and finally to
 munich
 here be history repeat itself here be another probe action another testing action if we let the republic of korea go under some other country would be next and then another and all the time the courage and confidence of the free world would be ebb away just as it do in the 1930 's and the united nations would go the way of the league of nations
 when i reach washington i meet immediately with the secretary of state the secretary of defense and general bradley and the other civilian and military official who have information and advice to help i decide on what to do we talk about the problem long and hard we consider those problem very carefully
 it be not easy to make the decision to send american boy again into battle i be a soldier in the first world war and i know what a soldier go through i know well the anguish that mother and father and family go through so i know what be ahead if we act in korea
 but after all this be say we realize that the issue be whether there would be fight in a limited area now or on a much large scale later on whether there would be some casualty now or many more casualty
 later
 so a decision be reach the decision i believe be the most important in my time as president of the united states
 in the day that follow the most heartening fact be that the american people clearly agree with the decision
 and in korea our man be fight as valiantly as americans have ever fight because they know they be fight in the same cause of freedom in which americans have stand ever since the beginning of the republic
 where free man have fail the test before this time we meet the test
 we meet it firmly we meet it successfully the aggression have be repel the communists have see their hope of easy conquest go down the drain the determination of free people to defend themselves have be make clear to the kremlin
 as i have think about our worldwide struggle with the communists these past 8 year day in and day out i have never once doubt that you the people of our country have the will to do what be necessary to win this terrible fight against communism i know the people of this country have that will and determination and i have always depend on it because i have be sure of that i have be able to make necessary decision even though they call for sacrifice by all of we and i have not be wrong in my judgment of the american people
 that same assurance of our people 's determination will be general eisenhower 's great source of strength in carry on this struggle
 now once in a while i get a letter from some impatient person ask why do not we get it over with why do not we issue an ultimatum make all out war drop the atomic bomb
 for most americans the answer be quite simple we be not make that way we be a moral people peace be our goal with justice and freedom we can not of our own free will violate the very principle that we be strive to defend the whole purpose of what we be do be to prevent world war iii start a war be no way to make peace
 but if anyone still think that just this once bad mean can bring good end then let i remind you of this we be live in the 8th year of the atomic age we be not the only nation that be learn to unleash the power of the atom a third world war might dig the grave not only of our communist opponent but also of our own society our world as well as theirs
 start an atomic war be totally unthinkable for rational man
 then some of you may ask when and how will the cold war end i think i can answer that simply the communist world have great resource and it look strong but there be a fatal flaw in their society theirs be a godless system a system of slavery there be no freedom in it no consent the iron curtain the secret police the constant purge all these be symptom of a great basic weakness the ruler fear of their own people
 in the long run the strength of our free society and our ideal will prevail over a system that have respect for neither god nor man
 last week in my state of the union message to the congress and i hope you will all take the time to read it i explain how i think we will
 finally win through
 as the free world grow strong more united more attractive to man on both side of the iron curtain and as the soviet hope for easy expansion be block then there will have to come a time of change in the soviet world nobody can say for sure when that be go to be or exactly how it will come about whether by revolution or trouble in the satellite state or by a change inside the kremlin
 whether the communist ruler shift their policy of their own free will or whether the change come about in some other way i have not a doubt in the world that a change will occur
 i have a deep and abide faith in the destiny of free man with patience and courage we shall some day move on into a new era a wonderful golden age an age when we can use the peaceful tool that science have forge for we to do away with poverty and human misery everywhere on earth
 think what can be do once our capital our skill our science most of all atomic energy can be release from the task of defense and turn wholly to peaceful purpose all around the world
 there be no end to what can be do
 i can not help but dream out loud just a little here
 the tigris and euphrates valley can be make to bloom as it do in the time of babylon and nineveh israel can be make the country of milk and honey as it be in the time of joshua
 there be a plateau in ethiopia some 6,000 to 8,000 foot high that have 65,000 square mile of land just exactly like the corn belt in northern illinois enough food can be raise there to feed a hundred million people
 there be place in south america place in colombia and venezuela and brazil just like that plateau in ethiopia place where food
 could be raise for million of people
 these thing can be do and they be self liquidate project if we can get peace and safety in the world under the united nations the development will come so fast we will not recognize the world in which we now live
 this be our dream of the future our picture of the world we hope to have when the communist threat be overcome
 i have talk a lot tonight about the menace of communism and our fight against it because that be the override issue of our time but there be some other thing we have do that history will record one of they be that we in america have learn how to attain real prosperity for our people
 we have 62 1/2 million people at work businessman farmer laborer white collar people all have well income and more of the good thing of life than ever before in the history of the world
 there have not be a failure of an insured bank in nearly 9 year no depositor have lose a cent in that period
 and the income of our people have be fairly distribute perhaps more so than at any other time in recent history
 we have make progress in spread the blessing of american life to all of our people there have be a tremendous awakening of the american conscience on the great issue of civil right equal economic opportunity equal right of citizenship and equal educational opportunity for all our people whatever their race or religion or status of birth
 so as i empty the drawer of this desk and as mrs. truman and i leave the white house we have no regret we feel we have do our good in the public service i hope and believe we have contribute to the welfare of this nation and to the peace of the world
 when franklin roosevelt die i feel there must be a million man well qualified than i to take up the presidential task but the work be mine to do and i have to do it and i have try to give it everything that be in i
 through all of it through all the year that i have work here in this room i have be well aware i do not really work alone that you be work with i
 no president could ever hope to lead our country or to sustain the burden of this office save as the people help with their support i have have that help you have give i that support on all our great essential undertaking to build the free world 's strength and keep the peace
 those be the big thing those be the thing we have do together
 for that i shall be grateful always
 and now the time have come for i to say good night and god bless you all

my friend before i begin the expression of those thought that i deem appropriate to this moment would you permit i the privilege of utter a little private prayer of my own and i ask that you bow your head
 almighty god as we stand here at this moment my future associate in the executive branch of government join i in beseech that thou will make full and complete our dedication to the service of the people in this throng and their fellow citizen everywhere
 give we we pray the power to discern clearly right from wrong and allow all our word and action to be govern thereby and by the law of this land especially we pray that our concern shall be for all the people regardless of station race or call
 may cooperation be permit and be the mutual aim of those who under the concept of our constitution hold to differ political faith so that all may work for the good of our beloved country and thy glory amen
 my fellow citizen the world and we have pass the midway point of a century of continue challenge we sense with all our faculty that force of good and evil be mass and armed and oppose as rarely before in history
 this fact define the meaning of this day we be summon by this honored and historic ceremony to witness more than the act of one citizen swear his oath of service in the presence of god we be call as a people to give testimony in the sight of the world to our faith that the future shall belong to the free
 since this century 's beginning a time of tempest have seem to come upon the continent of the earth masse of asia have awaken to strike off shackle of the past great nation of europe have fight their bloodiest war throne have topple and their vast empire have disappear new nation have be bear
 for our own country it have be a time of recur trial we have grow in power and in responsibility we have pass through the anxiety of depression and of war to a summit unmatched in man 's history seek to secure peace in the world we have have to fight through the forest of the argonne to the shore of iwo jima and to the cold mountain of korea
 in the swift rush of great event we find ourselves grope to know the full sense and meaning of these time in which we live in our quest of understanding we beseech god 's guidance we summon all our knowledge of the past and we scan all sign of the future we bring all our wit and all our will to meet the question
 how far have we come in man 's long pilgrimage from darkness toward the light be we near the light a day of freedom and of peace for all mankind or be the shadow of another night close in upon we
 great as be the preoccupation absorb we at home concern as we be with matter that deeply affect our livelihood today and our vision of the future each of these domestic problem be dwarf by and often even create by this question that involve all humankind
 this trial come at a moment when man 's power to achieve good or to inflict evil surpasse the bright hope and the sharp fear of all age we can turn river in their course level mountain to the plain ocean and land and sky be avenue for our colossal commerce disease diminish and life lengthen
 yet the promise of this life be imperil by the very genius that have make it possible nation amass wealth labor sweat to create and turn out device to level not only mountain but also city science seem ready to confer upon we as its final gift the power to erase human life from this planet
 at such a time in history we who be free must proclaim anew our faith this faith be the abide creed of our father it be our faith in the deathless dignity of man govern by eternal moral and natural law
 this faith define our full view of life it establish beyond debate those gift of the creator that be man 's inalienable right and that make all man equal in his sight
 in the light of this equality we know that the virtue most cherish by free people love of truth pride of work devotion to country all be treasure equally precious in the life of the most humble and of the most exalted the man who mine coal and fire furnace and balance ledger and turn lathe and pick cotton and heal the sick and plant corn all serve as proudly and as profitably for america as the statesman who draft treaty and the legislator who enact law
 this faith rule our whole way of life it decree that we the people elect leader not to rule but to serve it assert that we have the right to choice of our own work and to the reward of our own toil it inspire the initiative that make our productivity the wonder of the world and it warn that any man who seek to deny equality among all his brother betray the spirit of the free and invite the mockery of the tyrant
 it be because we all of we hold to these principle that the political change accomplish this day do not imply turbulence upheaval or disorder rather this change express a purpose of strengthen our dedication and devotion to the precept of our found document a conscious renewal of faith in our country and in the watchfulness of a divine providence
 the enemy of this faith know no god but force no devotion but its use they tutor man in treason they feed upon the hunger of other whatever defy they they torture especially the truth
 here then be join no argument between slightly differ philosophy this conflict strike directly at the faith of our father and the life of our son no principle or treasure that we hold from the spiritual knowledge of our free school and church to the creative magic of free labor and capital nothing lie safely beyond the reach of this struggle
 freedom be pit against slavery lightness against the dark
 the faith we hold belong not to we alone but to the free of all the world this common bond bind the grower of rice in burma and the planter of wheat in iowa the shepherd in southern italy and the mountaineer in the andes it confer a common dignity upon the french soldier who die in indo china the british soldier kill in malaya the american life give in korea
 we know beyond this that we be link to all free people not merely by a noble idea but by a simple need no free people can for long cling to any privilege or enjoy any safety in economic solitude for all our own material might even we need market in the world for the surplus of our farm and our factory equally we need for these same farm and factorie vital material and product of distant land this basic law of interdependence so manifest in the commerce of peace apply with thousand fold intensity in the event of war
 so we be persuade by necessity and by belief that the strength of all free people lie in unity their danger in discord
 to produce this unity to meet the challenge of our time destiny have lay upon our country the responsibility of the free world 's leadership
 so it be proper that we assure our friend once again that in the discharge of this responsibility we americans know and we observe the difference between world leadership and imperialism between firmness and truculence between a thoughtfully calculate goal and spasmodic reaction to the stimulus of emergency
 we wish our friend the world over to know this above all we face the threat not with dread and confusion but with confidence and conviction
 we feel this moral strength because we know that we be not helpless prisoner of history we be free man we shall remain free never to be prove guilty of the one capital offense against freedom a lack of stanch faith
 in plead our just cause before the bar of history and in press our labor for world peace we shall be guide by certain fix principle these principle be
 1 abhor war as a choose way to balk the purpose of those who threaten we we hold it to be the first task of statesmanship to develop the strength that will deter the force of aggression and promote the condition of peace for as it must be the supreme purpose of all free man so it must be the dedication of their leader to save humanity from prey upon itself
 in the light of this principle we stand ready to engage with any and all other in joint effort to remove the cause of mutual fear and distrust among nation so as to make possible drastic reduction of armament the sole requisite for undertake such effort be that in their purpose they be aim logically and honestly toward secure peace for all and that in their result they provide method by which every participate nation will prove good faith in carry out its pledge
 2 realize that common sense and common decency alike dictate the futility of appeasement we shall never try to placate an aggressor by the false and wicked bargain of trading honor for security americans indeed all free man remember that in the final choice a soldier 's pack be not so heavy a burden as a prisoner 's chain
 3 know that only a united states that be strong and immensely productive can help defend freedom in our world we view our nation 's strength and security as a trust upon which rest the hope of free man everywhere it be the firm duty of each of our free citizen and of every free citizen everywhere to place the cause of his country before the comfort the convenience of himself
 4 honor the identity and the special heritage of each nation in the world we shall never use our strength to try to impress upon another people our own cherish political and economic institution
 5 assess realistically the need and capacity of prove friend of freedom we shall strive to help they to achieve their own security and well being likewise we shall count upon they to assume within the limit of their resource their full and just burden in the common defense of freedom
 6 recognize economic health as an indispensable basis of military strength and the free world 's peace we shall strive to foster everywhere and to practice ourselves policy that encourage productivity and profitable trade for the impoverishment of any single people in the world mean danger to the well being of all other people
 7 appreciate that economic need military security and political wisdom combine to suggest regional grouping of free people we hope within the framework of the united nations to help strengthen such special bond the world over the nature of these tie must vary with the different problem of different area
 in the western hemisphere we enthusiastically join with all our neighbor in the work of perfect a community of fraternal trust and common purpose
 in europe we ask that enlighten and inspire leader of the western nation strive with renew vigor to make the unity of their people a reality only as free europe unitedly marshal its strength can it effectively safeguard even with our help its spiritual and cultural heritage
 8 conceive the defense of freedom like freedom itself to be one and indivisible we hold all continent and people in equal regard and honor we reject any insinuation that one race or another one people or another be in any sense inferior or expendable
 9 respect the united nations as the live sign of all people 's hope for peace we shall strive to make it not merely an eloquent symbol but an effective force and in our quest for an honorable peace we shall neither compromise nor tire nor ever cease
 by these rule of conduct we hope to be know to all people
 by their observance an earth of peace may become not a vision but a fact
 this hope this supreme aspiration must rule the way we live
 we must be ready to dare all for our country for history do not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid we must acquire proficiency in defense and display stamina in purpose
 we must be willing individually and as a nation to accept whatever sacrifice may be require of we a people that value its privilege above its principle soon lose both
 these basic precept be not lofty abstraction far remove from matter of daily living they be law of spiritual strength that generate and define our material strength patriotism mean equip force and a prepared citizenry moral stamina mean more energy and more productivity on the farm and in the factory love of liberty mean the guarding of every resource that make freedom possible from the sanctity of our family and the wealth of our soil to the genius of our scientist
 and so each citizen play an indispensable role the productivity of our head our hand and our heart be the source of all the strength we can command for both the enrichment of our life and the winning of the peace
 no person no home no community can be beyond the reach of this call we be summon to act in wisdom and in conscience to work with industry to teach with persuasion to preach with conviction to weigh our every deed with care and with compassion for this truth must be clear before we whatever america hope to bring to pass in the world must first come to pass in the heart of america
 the peace we seek then be nothing less than the practice and fulfillment of our whole faith among ourselves and in our dealing with other this signify more than the stilling of gun case the sorrow of war more than escape from death it be a way of life more than a haven for the weary it be a hope for the brave
 this be the hope that beckon we onward in this century of trial this be the work that await we all to be do with bravery with charity and with prayer to almighty god
 my citizen i thank you

mr. president mr. speaker members of the eighty third congress i welcome the honor of appear before you to deliver my first message to the congress it be manifestly the joint purpose of the congressional leadership and of this administration to justify the summon to governmental responsibility issue last november by the american people the grand labor of this leadership will involve application of america 's influence in world affair with such fortitude and such foresight that it will deter aggression and eventually secure peace;establishment of a national administration of such integrity and such efficiency that its honor at home will ensure respect abroad;encouragement of those incentive that inspire creative initiative in our economy so that its productivity may fortify freedom everywhere anddedication to the well being of all our citizen and to the attainment of equality of opportunity for all so that our nation will ever act with the strength of unity in every task to which it be call the purpose of this message be to suggest certain line along which our joint effort may immediately be direct toward realization of these four rule purpose the time that this administration have be in office have be too brief to permit preparation of a detailed and comprehensive program of recommend action to cover all phase of the responsibility that devolve upon our country 's new leader such a program will be fill out in the week ahead as after appropriate study i shall submit additional recommendation for your consideration today can provide only a sure and substantial beginning ii.our country have come through a painful period of trial and disillusionment since the victory of 1945 we anticipate a world of peace and cooperation the calculated pressure of aggressive communism have force we instead to live in a world of turmoil from this costly experience we have learn one clear lesson we have learn that the free world can not indefinitely remain in a posture of paralyzed tension leave forever to the aggressor the choice of time and place and mean to cause great hurt to we at least cost to himself this administration have therefore begin the definition of a new positive foreign policy this policy will be govern by certain fix idea they be these:(1 our foreign policy must be clear consistent and confident this mean that it must be the product of genuine continuous cooperation between the executive and the legislative branch of this government it must be develop and direct in the spirit of true bipartisanship.(2 the policy we embrace must be a coherent global policy the freedom we cherish and defend in europe and in the americas be no different from the freedom that be imperil in asia.(3 our policy dedicate to make the free world secure will envision all peaceful method and device except break faith with our friend we shall never acquiesce in the enslavement of any people in order to purchase fancied gain for ourselves i shall ask the congress at a later date to join in an appropriate resolution make clear that this government recognize no kind of commitment contain in secret understanding of the past with foreign government which permit this kind of enslavement.(4 the policy we pursue will recognize the truth that no single country even one so powerful as ours can alone defend the liberty of all nation threaten by communist aggression from without or subversion within mutual security mean effective mutual cooperation for the united states this mean that as a matter of common sense and national interest we shall give help to other nation in the measure that they strive earnestly to do their full share of the common task no wealth of aid could compensate for poverty of spirit the heart of every free nation must be honestly dedicated to the preserving of its own independence and security.(5 our policy will be design to foster the advent of practical unity in western europe the nation of that region have contribute notably to the effort of sustain the security of the free world from the jungle of indochina and malaya to the northern shore of europe they have vastly improve their defensive strength where call upon to do so they have make costly and bitter sacrifice to hold the line of freedom but the problem of security demand close cooperation among the nation of europe than have be know to date only a more closely integrate economic and political system can provide the greatly increase economic strength need to maintain both necessary military readiness and respectable living standard europe 's enlightened leader have long be aware of these fact all the devoted work that have go into the schuman plan the european army and the strasbourg conference have testify to their vision and determination these achievement be the more remarkable when we realize that each of they have mark a victory for france and for germany alike over the division that in the past have bring such tragedy to these two great nation and to the world the need unity of western europe manifestly can not be manufacture from without it can only be create from within but it be right and necessary that we encourage europe 's leader by inform they of the high value we place upon the earnestness of their effort toward this goal real progress will be conclusive evidence to the american people that our material sacrifice in the cause of collective security be match by essential political economic and military accomplishment in western europe.(6 our foreign policy will recognize the importance of profitable and equitable world trade a substantial beginning can and should be make by our friend themselves europe for example be now mark by checkered area of labor surplus and labor shortage of agricultural area need machine and industrial area need food here and elsewhere we can hope that our friend will take the initiative in create broad market and more dependable currency to allow great exchange of good and service among themselves action along these line can create an economic environment that will invite vital help from we this help include first revise our custom regulation to remove procedural obstacle to profitable trade i far recommend that the congress take the reciprocal trade agreements act under immediate study and extend it by appropriate legislation this objective must not ignore legitimate safeguarding of domestic industry agriculture and labor standard in all executive study and recommendation on this problem labor and management and farmer alike will be earnestly consult second do whatever government properly can to encourage the flow of private american investment abroad this involve as a serious and explicit purpose of our foreign policy the encouragement of a hospitable climate for such investment in foreign nation third availing ourselves of facility overseas for the economical production of manufacture article which be need for mutual defense and which be not seriously competitive with our own normal peacetime production fourth receive from the rest of the world in equitable exchange for what we supply great amount of important raw material which we do not ourselves possess in adequate quantity iii.in this general discussion of our foreign policy i must make special mention of the war in korea this war be for americans the most painful phase of communist aggression throughout the world it be clearly a part of the same calculated assault that the aggressor be simultaneously press in indochina and in malaya and of the strategic situation that manifestly embrace the island of formosa and the chinese nationalist force there the work out of any military solution to the korean war will inevitably affect all these area the administration be give immediate increase attention to the development of additional republic of korea force the citizen of that country have prove their capacity as fight man and their eagerness to take a great share in the defense of their homeland organization equipment and training will allow they to do so increase assistance to korea for this purpose conform fully to our global policy in june 1950 follow the aggressive attack on the republic of korea the united states seventh fleet be instruct both to prevent attack upon formosa and also to insure that formosa should not be use as a base of operation against the chinese communist mainland this have mean in effect that the united states navy be require to serve as a defensive arm of communist china regardless of the situation in 1950 since the date of that order the chinese communists have invade korea to attack the united nations force there they have consistently reject the proposal of the united nations command for an armistice they recently join with soviet russia in reject the armistice proposal sponsor in the united nations by the government of india this proposal have be accept by the united states and 53 other nation consequently there be no long any logic or sense in a condition that require the united states navy to assume defensive responsibility on behalf of the chinese communists thus permit those communists with great impunity to kill our soldier and those of our united nations ally in korea i be therefore issue instruction that the seventh fleet no long be employ to shield communist china this order imply no aggressive intent on our part but we certainly have no obligation to protect a nation fight we in korea iv.our labor for peace in korea and in the world imperatively demand the maintenance by the united states of a strong fighting service ready for any contingency our problem be to achieve adequate military strength within the limit of endurable strain upon our economy to amass military power without regard to our economic capacity would be to defend ourselves against one kind of disaster by invite another both military and economic objective demand a single national military policy proper coordination of our armed service and effective consolidation of certain logistic activity we must eliminate waste and duplication of effort in the armed service we must realize clearly that size alone be not sufficient the big force be not necessarily the good and we want the good we must not let tradition or habit of the past stand in the way of develop an efficient military force all member of our force must be ever mindful that they serve under a single flag and for a single cause we must effectively integrate our armament program and plan they in such careful relation to our industrial facility that we assure the good use of our manpower and our material because of the complex technical nature of our military organization and because of the security reason involve the secretary of defense must take the initiative and assume the responsibility for develop plan to give our nation maximum safety at minimum cost accordingly the new secretary of defense and his civilian and military associate will in the future recommend such change in present law affect our defense activity as may be necessary to clarify responsibility and improve the total effectiveness of our defense effort this effort must always conform to policy lay down in the national security council the statutory function of the national security council be to assist the president in the formulation and coordination of significant domestic foreign and military policy require for the security of the nation in these day of tension it be essential that this central body have the vitality to perform effectively its statutory role i propose to see that it do so careful formulation of policy must be follow by clear understanding of they by all people a related need therefore be to make more effective all activity of the government relate to international information i have recently appoint a committee of representative and informed citizen to survey this subject and to make recommendation in the near future for legislative administrative or other action a unified and dynamic effort in this whole field be essential to the security of the united states and of the other people in the community of free nation there be but one sure way to avoid total war and that be to win the cold war while retaliatory power be one strong deterrent to a would be aggressor another powerful deterrent be defensive power no enemy be likely to attempt an attack foredoom to failure because the building of a completely impenetrable defense against attack be still not possible total defensive strength must include civil defense preparedness because we have incontrovertible evidence that soviet russia possess atomic weapon this kind of protection become sheer necessity civil defense responsibility primarily belong to the state and local government recruiting training and organize volunteer to meet any emergency the immediate job of the federal government be to provide leadership to supply technical guidance and to continue to strengthen its civil defense stockpile of medical engineering and related supply and equipment this work must go forward without lag v.i have refer to the inescapable need for economic health and strength if we be to maintain adequate military power and exert influential leadership for peace in the world our immediate task be to chart a fiscal and economic policy that can:(1 reduce the plan deficit and then balance the budget which mean among other thing reduce federal expenditure to the safe minimum;(2 meet the huge cost of our defense;(3 properly handle the burden of our inheritance of debt and obligations;(4 check the menace of inflation;(5 work toward the early possible reduction of the tax burden;(6 make constructive plan to encourage the initiative of our citizen it be important that all of we understand that this administration do not and can not begin its task with a clean slate much already have be write on the record beyond our power quickly to erase or to amend this record include our inherit burden of indebtedness and obligation and deficit the current year 's budget as you know carry a 5.9 billion dollar deficit and the budget which be present to you before this administration take office indicate a budgetary deficit of 9.9 billion for the fiscal year end june 30 1954 the national debt be now more than 265 billion dollar in addition the accumulate obligational authority of the federal government for future payment total over 80 billion dollar even this amount be exclusive of large contingent liability so numerous and extensive as to be almost beyond description the bill for the payment of nearly all of the 80 billion dollar of obligation will be present during the next 4 year these bill add to the current cost of government we must meet make a formidable burden the present authorize government debt limit be 275 billion dollar the forecast present by the outgoing administration with the fiscal year 1954 budget indicate that before the end of the fiscal year and at the peak of demand for payment during the year the total government debt may approach and even exceed that limit unless budgeted deficit be check the momentum of past program will force an increase of the statutory debt limit permit i this one understatement to meet and to correct this situation will not be easy permit i this one assurance every department head and i be determined to do everything we can to resolve it the first order of business be the elimination of the annual deficit this can not be achieve merely by exhortation it demand the concerted action of all those in responsible position in the government and the earnest cooperation of the congress already we have begin an examination of the appropriation and expenditure of all department in an effort to find significant item that may be decrease or cancel without damage to our essential requirement get control of the budget require also that state and local government and interested group of citizen restrain themselves in their demand upon the congress that the federal treasury spend more and more money for all type of project a balanced budget be an essential first measure in check further depreciation in the buying power of the dollar this be one of the critical step to be take to bring an end to planned inflation our purpose be to manage the government 's finance so as to help and not hinder each family in balance its own budget reduction of taxis will be justify only as we show we can succeed in bring the budget under control as the budget be balanced and inflation check the tax burden that today stifle initiative can and must be ease until we can determine the extent to which expenditure can be reduce it would not be wise to reduce our revenue meanwhile the tax structure as a whole demand review the secretary of the treasury be undertake this study immediately we must develop a system of taxation which will impose the least possible obstacle to the dynamic growth of the country this include particularly real opportunity for the growth of small business many readjustment in exist taxis will be necessary to serve these objective and also to remove exist inequity clarification and simplification in the tax law as well as the regulation will be undertake in the entire area of fiscal policy which must in its various aspect be treat in recommendation to the congress in come week there can now be state certain basic fact and principle first it be axiomatic that our economy be a highly complex and sensitive mechanism hasty and ill consider action of any kind could seriously upset the subtle equation that encompass debt obligation expenditure defense demand deficit taxis and the general economic health of the nation our goal can be clear our start toward they can be immediate but action must be gradual second it be clear that too great a part of the national debt come due in too short a time the department of the treasury will undertake at suitable time a program of extend part of the debt over long period and gradually place great amount in the hand of long term investor third past difference in policy between the treasury and the federal reserve board have help to encourage inflation henceforth i expect that their single purpose shall be to serve the whole nation by policy design to stabilize the economy and encourage the free play of our people 's genius for individual initiative in encourage this initiative no single item in our current problem have receive more thoughtful consideration by my associate and by the many individual call into our counsel than the matter of price and wage control by law the great economic strength of our democracy have develop in an atmosphere of freedom the character of our people resist artificial and arbitrary control of any kind direct control except those on credit deal not with the real cause of inflation but only with its symptom in time of national emergency this kind of control have a role to play our whole system however be base upon the assumption that normally we should combat wide fluctuation in our price structure by rely largely on the effective use of sound fiscal and monetary policy and upon the natural working of economic law moreover american labor and american business can well resolve their wage problem across the bargaining table government should refrain from sit in with they unless in extreme case the public welfare require protection we be of course live in an international situation that be neither an emergency demand full mobilization nor be it peace no one can know how long this condition will persist consequently we be force to learn many new thing as we go along cling to what work discard what do not in all our current discussion on these and related fact the weight of evidence be clearly against the use of control in their present form they have prove largely unsatisfactory or unworkable they have not prevent inflation they have not keep down the cost of living dissatisfaction with they be wholly justified i be convinced that now as well as in the long run free and competitive price will well serve the interest of all the people and good meet the change grow need of our economy accordingly i do not intend to ask for a renewal of the present wage and price control on april 30 1953 when present legislation expire in the meantime step will be take to eliminate control in an orderly manner and to terminate special agency no long need for this purpose it be obviously to be expect that the removal of these control will result in individual price change some up some down but a maximum of freedom in market price as well as in collective bargaining be characteristic of a truly free people i believe also that material and product control should be end except with respect to defense priority and scarce and critical item essential for our defense i shall recommend to the congress that legislation be enact to continue authority for such remain control of this type as will be necessary after the expiration of the exist statute on june 30 1953.i recommend the continuance of the authority for federal control over rent in those community in which serious housing shortage exist these be chiefly the so call defense area in these and all area the federal government should withdraw from the control of rent as soon as practicable but before they be remove entirely each legislature should have full opportunity to take over within its own state responsibility for this function it would be idle to pretend that all our problem in this whole field of price will solve themselves by mere federal withdrawal from direct control we shall have to watch trend closely if the free functioning of our economic system as well as the indirect control which can be appropriately employ prove insufficient during this period of strain and tension i shall promptly ask the congress to enact such legislation as may be require in face all these problem wage price production tax rate fiscal policy deficit everywhere we remain constantly mindful that the time for sacrifice have not end but we be concern with the encouragement of competitive enterprise and individual initiative precisely because we know they to be our nation 's abide source of strength vi.our vast world responsibility accent with urgency our people 's elemental right to a government whose clear quality be loyalty security efficiency economy and integrity the safety of america and the trust of the people alike demand that the personnel of the federal government be loyal in their motive and reliable in the discharge of their duty only a combination of both loyalty and reliability promise genuine security to state this principle be easy to apply it can be difficult but this security we must and shall have by way of example all principal new appointee to department and agency have be investigate at their own request by the federal bureau of investigation confident of your understanding and cooperation i know that the primary responsibility for keep out the disloyal and the dangerous rest squarely upon the executive branch when this branch so conduct itself as to require police by another branch of the government it invite its own disorder and confusion i be determined to meet this responsibility of the executive the head of all executive department and agency have be instruct to initiate at once effective program of security with respect to their personnel the attorney general will advise and guide the department and agency in the shaping of these program design at once to govern the employment of new personnel and to review speedily any derogatory information concern incumbent personnel to carry out these program i believe that the power of the executive branch under exist law be sufficient if they should prove inadequate the necessary legislation will be request these program will be both fair to the right of the individual and effective for the safety of the nation they will with care and justice apply the basic principle that public employment be not a right but a privilege all these measure have two clear purpose their first purpose be to make certain that this nation 's security be not jeopardize by false servant their second purpose be to clear the atmosphere of that unreasoned suspicion that accept rumor and gossip as substitute for evidence our people of course deserve and demand of their federal government more than security of personnel they demand also efficient and logical organization true to constitutional principle i have already establish a committee on government organization the committee be use as its point of departure the report of the hoover commission and subsequent study by several independent agency to achieve the great efficiency and economy which the committee analyse show to be possible i ask the congress to extend the present government reorganization act for a period of 18 month or 2 year beyond its expiration date of april 1 1953.there be more involved here than realign the wheel and smooth the gear of administrative machinery the congress rightfully expect the executive to take the initiative in discover and remove outmoded function and eliminate duplication one agency for example whose head have promise early and vigorous action to provide great efficiency be the post office one of the old institution of our federal government its service should be of the good its employee should merit and receive the high regard and esteem of the citizen of the nation there be today in some area of the postal service both waste and incompetence to be correct with the cooperation of the congress and take advantage of its accumulate experience in postal affair the postmaster general will institute a program direct at improve service while at the same time reduce cost and decrease deficit in all department dedication to these basic precept of security and efficiency integrity and economy can and will produce an administration deserve of the trust the people have place in it our people have demand nothing less than good efficient government they shall get nothing less vii.vitally important be the water and mineral public land and stand timber forage and mid life of this country a fast grow population will have vast future need in these resource we must more than match the substantial achievement in the half century since president theodore roosevelt awaken the nation to the problem of conservation this call for a strong federal program in the field of resource development its major project should be time where possible to assist in level off peak and valley in our economic life soundly plan project already initiate should be carry out new one will be plan for the future the good natural resource program for america will not result from exclusive dependence on federal bureaucracy it will involve a partnership of the states and local community private citizen and the federal government all work together this combined effort will advance the development of the great river valley of our nation and the power that they can generate likewise such a partnership can be effective in the expansion throughout the nation of upstream storage the sound use of public land the wise conservation of mineral and the sustained yield of our forest there have be much criticism some of it apparently justify of the confusion result from overlap federal activity in the entire field of resource conservation this matter be be exhaustively study and appropriate reorganization plan will be develop most of these particular resource problem pertain to the department of the interior another of its major concern be our country 's island possession here one matter deserve attention the platform of both political party promise immediate statehood to hawaii the people of that territory have earn that status statehood should be grant promptly with the first election schedule for 1954.viii.one of the difficult problem which face the new administration be that of the slow irregular decline of farm price this decline which have be go on for almost 2 year have occur at a time when most nonfarm price and farm cost of production be extraordinarily high present agricultural legislation provide for the mandatory support of the price of basic farm commodity at 90 percent of parity the secretary of agriculture and his associate will of course execute the present act faithfully and thereby seek to mitigate the consequence of the downturn in farm income this price support legislation will expire at the end of 1954.so we should begin now to consider what farm legislation we should develop for 1955 and beyond our aim should be economic stability and full parity of income for american farmer but we must seek this goal in way that minimize governmental interference in the farmer affair that permit desirable shift in production and that encourage farmer themselves to use initiative in meeting change economic condition a continue study reveal nothing more emphatically than the complicated nature of this subject among other thing it show that the prosperity of our agriculture depend directly upon the prosperity of the whole country upon the purchasing power of american consumer it depend also upon the opportunity to ship abroad large surplus of particular commodity and therefore upon sound economic relationship between the united states and many foreign country it involve research and scientific investigation conduct on an extensive scale it involve special credit mechanism and marketing rural electrification soil conservation and other program the whole complex of agricultural program and policy will be study by a special agricultural advisory commission as i know it will by appropriate committee of the congress a nonpartisan group of respected authority in the field of agriculture have already be appoint as an interim advisory group the immediate change need in agricultural program be largely budgetary and administrative in nature new policy and new program must await the completion of the far reach study which have already be launch ix.the determination of labor policy must be govern not by the vagary of political expediency but by the firm principle and conviction slanted partisan appeal to american worker speak as if they be a group apart necessitate a special language and treatment be an affront to the fullness of their dignity as american citizen the truth in matter of labor policy have become obscure in controversy the very meaning of economic freedom as it affect labor have become confused this misunderstanding have provide a climate of opinion favor the growth of governmental paternalism in labor relation this tendency if leave uncorrecte could end only by produce a bureaucratic despotism economic freedom be in fact the requisite of great prosperity for every american who earn his own living in the field of labor legislation only a law that merit the respect and support of both labor and management can help reduce the loss of wage and of production through strike and stoppage and thus add to the total economic strength of our nation we have now have 5 year experience with the labor management act of 1947 commonly know as the taft hartley act that experience have show the need for some corrective action and we should promptly proceed to amend that act i know that the congress be already proceed with renew study of this subject meanwhile the department of labor be at once begin work to devise further specific recommendation for your consideration in the careful work out of legislation i know you will give thoughtful consideration as will we in the executive branch to the view of labor and of management and of the general public in this process it be only human that each of we should bring forward the argument of self interest but if all conduct their argument in the overpowering light of national interest which be enlighten self interest we shall get the right answer i profoundly hope that every citizen of our country will follow with understand your progress in this work the welfare of all of we be involve especially must we remember that the institution of trade unionism and collective bargaining be monument to the freedom that must prevail in our industrial life they have a century of honorable achievement behind they our faith in they be prove firm and final government can do a great deal to aid the settlement of labor dispute without allow itself to be employ as an ally of either side its proper role in industrial strife be to encourage the process of mediation and conciliation these process can successfully be direct only by a government free from the taint of any suspicion that it be partial or punitive the administration intend to strengthen and to improve the service which the department of labor can render to the worker and to the whole national community this department be create just 40 year ago to serve the entire nation it must aid for example employer and employee alike in improve training program that will develop skilled and competent worker it must enjoy the confidence and respect of labor and industry in order to play a significant role in the planning of america 's economic future to that end i be authorize the department of labor to establish promptly a tripartite advisory committee consist of representative of employer labor and the public x.our civil and social right form a central part of the heritage we be strive to defend on all front and with all our strength i believe with all my heart that our vigilant guarding of these right be a sacred obligation bind upon every citizen to be true to one 's own freedom be in essence to honor and respect the freedom of all other a cardinal ideal in this heritage we cherish be the equality of right of all citizen of every race and color and creed we know that discrimination against minority persist despite our allegiance to this ideal such discrimination confine to no one section of the nation be but the outward testimony to the persistence of distrust and of fear in the heart of man this fact make all the more vital the fighting of these wrong by each individual in every station of life in his every deed much of the answer lie in the power of fact fully publicize of persuasion honestly press and of conscience justly arouse these be method familiar to our way of life test and prove wise i propose to use whatever authority exist in the office of the president to end segregation in the district of columbia include the federal government and any segregation in the armed forces here in the district of columbia serious attention should be give to the proposal to develop and authorize through legislation a system to provide an effective voice in local self government while consideration of this proceed i recommend an immediate increase of two in the number of district commissioners to broaden representation of all element of our local population this will be a first step toward insure that this capital provide an honored example to all community of our nation in this manner and by the leadership of the office of the president exercise through friendly conference with those in authority in our states and city we expect to make true and rapid progress in civil right and equality of employment opportunity there be one sphere in which civil right be inevitably involve in federal legislation this be the sphere of immigration it be a manifest right of our government to limit the number of immigrant our nation can absorb it be also a manif right of our government to set reasonable requirement on the character and the number of the people who come to share our land and our freedom it be well for we however to remind ourselves occasionally of an equally manifest fact we be one and all immigrant or son and daughter of immigrant exist legislation contain injustice it do in fact discriminate i be inform by member of the congress that it be realize at the time of its enactment that future study of the basis of determine quota would be necessary i be therefore request the congress to review this legislation and to enact a statute that will at one and the same time guard our legitimate national interest and be faithful to our basic idea of freedom and fairness to all in another but related area that of social right we see most clearly the new application of old idea of freedom this administration be profoundly aware of two great need bear of our live in a complex industrial economy first the individual citizen must have safeguard against personal disaster inflict by force beyond his control second the welfare of the people demand effective and economical performance by the government of certain indispensable social service in the light of this responsibility certain general purpose and certain concrete measure be plainly indicate now there be urgent need for great effectiveness in our program both public and private offer safeguard against the privation that too often come with unemployment old age illness and accident the provision of the old age and survivor insurance law should promptly be extend to cover million of citizen who have be leave out of the social security system no less important be the encouragement of privately sponsor pension plan most important of all of course be renew effort to check the inflation which destroy so much of the value of all social security payment our school system demand some prompt effective help during each of the last 9 year more than 1 ½ million child have swell the elementary and secondary school population of the country generally the school population be proportionately high in states with low per capita income this whole situation call for careful congressional study and action i be sure that you share my conviction that the firm condition of federal aid must be prove need and prove lack of local income one phase of the school problem demand special action the school population of many district have be greatly in- crease by the swift growth of defense activity these activity have add little or nothing to the tax resource of the community affect legislation aid construction of school in the district expire on june 30 this law should be renew and likewise the partial payment for current operating expense for these particular school district should be make include the deficiency requirement of the current fiscal year public interest similarly demand one prompt specific action in protection of the general consumer the food and drug administration should be authorize to continue its establish and necessary program of factory inspection the invalidation of these inspection by the supreme court of december 8 1952 be base solely on the fact that the present law contain inconsistent and unclear provision these must be promptly correct i be well aware that beyond these few immediate measure there remain much to be do the health and housing need of our people call for intelligently plan program involve be the solvency of the whole security system and its guard against exploitation by the irresponsible to bring clear purpose and orderly procedure into this field i anticipate a thorough study of the proper relationship among federal state and local program i shall shortly send you specific recommendation for establish such an appropriate commission together with a reorganization plan define new administrative status for all federal activity in health education and social security i repeat that there be many important subject of which i make no mention today among these be our great and grow body of veteran america have traditionally be generous in care for the disabled and the widow and the orphan of the fall these million remain close to all our heart proper care of our uniformed citizen and appreciation of the past service of our veteran be part of our accept governmental responsibility xiwe have survey briefly some problem of our people and a portion of the task before we the hope of freedom itself depend in real measure upon our strength our heart and our wisdom we must be strong in arm we must be strong in the source of all our armament our productivity we all worker and farmer foreman and financier technician and builder all must produce produce more and produce yet more we must be strong above all in the spiritual resource upon which all else depend we must be devote with all our heart to the value we defend we must know that each of these value and virtue apply with equal force at the end of the earth and in our relation with our neighbor next door we must know that freedom express itself with equal eloquence in the right of worker to strike in the nearby factory and in the yearning and suffering of the people of eastern europe as our heart summon our strength our wisdom must direct it there be in world affair a steady course to be follow between an assertion of strength that be truculent and a confession of helplessness that be cowardly there be in our affair at home a middle way between untrammeled freedom of the individual and the demand for the welfare of the whole nation this way must avoid government by bureaucracy as carefully as it avoid neglect of the helpless in every area of political action free man must think before they can expect to win in this spirit must we live and labor confident of our strength compassionate in our heart clear in our mind in this spirit let we together turn to the great task before we note this be the text of the document which the president sign and transmit to the senate and house of representatives h. doc 75 83d cong 1st sess the address as report from the floor appear in the congressional record vol 99 p. 748
in this spring of 1953 the free world weigh one question above all other the chance for a just peace for all people
 to weigh this chance be to summon instantly to mind another recent moment of great decision it come with that yet more hopeful spring of 1945 bright with the promise of victory and of freedom the hope of all just man in that moment too be a just and last peace
 the 8 year that have pass have see that hope waver grow dim and almost die and the shadow of fear again have darkly lengthen across the world
 today the hope of free man remain stubborn and brave but it be sternly discipline by experience it shun not only all crude counsel of despair but also the self deceit of easy illusion it weigh the chance for peace with sure clear knowledge of what happen to the vain hope of 1945
 in that spring of victory the soldier of the western allies meet the soldier of russia in the center of europe they be triumphant comrade in arm their people share the joyous prospect of building in honor of their dead the only fitting monument an age of just peace all these war weary people share too this concrete decent purpose to guard vigilantly against the domination ever again of any part of the world by a single unbridle aggressive power
 this common purpose last an instant and perish the nation of the world divide to follow two distinct road
 the united states and our value friend the other free nation choose one road
 the leader of the soviet union choose another
 the way choose by the united states be plainly mark by a few clear precept which govern its conduct in world affair
 first no people on earth can be hold as a people to be an enemy for all humanity share the common hunger for peace and fellowship and justice
 second no nation 's security and well being can be lastingly achieve in isolation but only in effective cooperation with fellow nation
 third any nation 's right to a form of government and an economic system of its own choosing be inalienable
 fourth any nation 's attempt to dictate to other nation their form of government be indefensible
 and fifth a nation 's hope of last peace can not be firmly base upon any race in armament but rather upon just relation and honest understanding with all other nation
 in the light of these principle the citizen of the united states define the way they propose to follow through the aftermath of war toward true peace
 this way be faithful to the spirit that inspire the united nations to prohibit strife to relieve tension to banish fear this way be to control and to reduce armament this way be to allow all nation to devote their energy and resource to the great and good task of heal the war 's wound of clothing and feeding and house the needy of perfect a just political life of enjoy the fruit of their own free toil
 the soviet government hold a vastly different vision of the future
 in the world of its design security be to be find not in mutual trust and mutual aid but in force huge army subversion rule of neighbor nation the goal be power superiority at all cost security be to be seek by deny it to all other
 the result have be tragic for the world and for the soviet union it have also be ironic
 the amassing of soviet power alert free nation to a new danger of aggression it compel they in self defense to spend unprecedented money and energy for armament it force they to develop weapon of war now capable of inflict instant and terrible punishment upon any aggressor
 it instill in the free nation and let none doubt this the unshakable conviction that as long as there persist a threat to freedom they must at any cost remain armed strong and ready for the risk of war
 it inspire they and let none doubt this to attain a unity of purpose and will beyond the power of propaganda or pressure to break now or ever
 there remain however one thing essentially unchanged and unaffected by soviet conduct the readiness of the free nation to welcome sincerely any genuine evidence of peaceful purpose enable all people again to resume their common quest of just peace
 the free nation most solemnly and repeatedly have assure the soviet union that their firm association have never have any aggressive purpose whatsoever soviet leader however have seem to persuade themselves or try to persuade their people otherwise
 and so it have come to pass that the soviet union itself have share and suffer the very fear it have foster in the rest of the world
 this have be the way of life forge by 8 year of fear and force
 what can the world or any nation in it hope for if no turning be find on this dread road
 the bad to be fear and the good to be expect can be simply state
 the bad be atomic war
 the good would be this a life of perpetual fear and tension a burden of arm drain the wealth and the labor of all people a wasting of strength that defy the american system or the soviet system or any system to achieve true abundance and happiness for the people of this earth
 every gun that be make every warship launch every rocket fire signifie in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and be not feed those who be cold and be not clothe this world in arm be not spend money alone
 it be spend the sweat of its laborer the genius of its scientist the hope of its child
 the cost of one modern heavy bomber be this a modern brick school in more than 30 city
 it be two electric power plant each serve a town of 60,000 population
 it be two fine fully equip hospital it be some 50 mile of concrete highway
 we pay for a single fighter plane with a half million bushel of wheat
 we pay for a single destroyer with new home that could have house more than 8,000 people
 this i repeat be the good way of life to be find on the road the world have be take
 this be not a way of life at all in any true sense under the cloud of threaten war it be humanity hang from a cross of iron
 these plain and cruel truth define the peril and point the hope that come with this spring of 1953
 this be one of those time in the affair of nation when the grave choice must be make if there be to be a turning toward a just and last peace
 it be a moment that call upon the government of the world to speak their intention with simplicity and with honesty
 it call upon they to answer the question that stir the heart of all sane man be there no other way the world may live
 the world know that an era end with the death of joseph stalin the extraordinary 30 year span of his rule see the soviet empire expand to reach from the baltic sea to the sea of japan finally to dominate 800 million soul
 the soviet system shape by stalin and his predecessor be bear of one world war it survive with stubborn and often amazing courage a second world war it have live to threaten a third
 now a new leadership have assume power in the soviet union its link to the past however strong can not bind it completely its future be in great part its own to make
 this new leadership confront a free world arouse as rarely in its history by the will to stay free
 this free world know out of the bitter wisdom of experience that vigilance and sacrifice be the price of liberty
 it know that the defense of western europe imperatively demand the unity of purpose and action make possible by the north atlantic treaty organization embrace a european defense community
 it know that western germany deserve to be a free and equal partner in this community and that this for germany be the only safe way to full final unity
 it know that aggression in korea and in southeast asia be threat to the whole free community to be meet by united action
 this be the kind of free world which the new soviet leadership confront it be a world that demand and expect the full respect of its right and interest it be a world that will always accord the same respect to all other
 so the new soviet leadership now have a precious opportunity to awaken with the rest of the world to the point of peril reach and to help turn the tide of history
 will it do this
 we do not yet know recent statement and gesture of soviet leader give some evidence that they may recognize this critical moment
 we welcome every honest act of peace
 we care nothing for mere rhetoric
 we be only for sincerity of peaceful purpose attest by deed the opportunity for such deed be many the performance of a great number of they wait upon no complex protocol but upon the simple will to do they even a few such clear and specific act such as the soviet union 's signature upon an austrian treaty or its release of thousand of prisoner still hold from world war ii would be impressive sign of sincere intent they would carry a power of persuasion not to be match by any amount of oratory
 this we do know a world that begin to witness the rebirth of trust among nation can find its way to a peace that be neither partial nor punitive
 with all who will work in good faith toward such a peace we be ready with renew resolve to strive to redeem the near lose hope of our day
 the first great step along this way must be the conclusion of an honorable armistice in korea
 this mean the immediate cessation of hostility and the prompt initiation of political discussion lead to the holding of free election in a united korea
 it should mean no less importantly an end to the direct and indirect attack upon the security of indochina and malaya for any armistice in korea that merely release aggressive army to attack elsewhere would be a fraud
 we seek throughout asia as throughout the world a peace that be true and total
 out of this can grow a still wide task the achieving of just political settlement for the other serious and specific issue between the free world and the soviet union
 none of these issue great or small be insoluble give only the will to respect the right of all nation
 again we say the united states be ready to assume its just part
 we have already do all within our power to speed conclusion of a treaty with austria which will free that country from economic exploitation and from occupation by foreign troop
 we be ready not only to press forward with the present plan for close unity of the nation of western europe but also upon that foundation to strive to foster a broad european community conducive to the free movement of person of trade and of idea
 this community would include a free and united germany with a government base upon free and secret election
 this free community and the full independence of the east european nation could mean the end of the present unnatural division of europe
 as progress in all these area strengthen world trust we could proceed concurrently with the next great work the reduction of the burden of armament now weigh upon the world to this end we would welcome and enter into the most solemn agreement these could properly include
 1 the limitation by absolute number or by an agree international ratio of the size of the military and security force of all nation
 2 a commitment by all nation to set an agree limit upon that proportion of total production of certain strategic material to be devoted to military purpose
 3 international control of atomic energy to promote its use for peaceful purpose only and to insure the prohibition of atomic weapon
 4 a limitation or prohibition of other category of weapon of great destructiveness
 5 the enforcement of all these agree limitation and prohibition by adequate safeguard include a practical system of inspection under the united nations
 the detail of such disarmament program be manifestly critical and complex neither the united states nor any other nation can properly claim to possess a perfect immutable formula but the formula matter less than the faith the good faith without which no formula can work justly and effectively
 the fruit of success in all these task would present the world with the great task and the great opportunity of all it be this the dedication of the energy the resource and the imagination of all peaceful nation to a new kind of war this would be a declare total war not upon any human enemy but upon the brute force of poverty and need
 the peace we seek round upon decent trust and cooperative effort among nation can be fortify not by weapon of war but by wheat and by cotton by milk and by wool by meat and by timber and by rice these be word that translate into every language on earth these be need that challenge this world in arm
 this idea of a just and peaceful world be not new or strange to we it inspire the people of the united states to initiate the european recovery program in 1947 that program be prepared to treat with like and equal concern the need of eastern and western europe
 we be prepared to reaffirm with the most concrete evidence our readiness to help build a world in which all people can be productive and prosperous
 this government be ready to ask its people to join with all nation in devote a substantial percentage of the saving achieve by disarmament to a fund for world aid and reconstruction the purpose of this great work would be to help other people to develop the undeveloped area of the world to stimulate profitable and fair world trade to assist all people to know the blessing of productive freedom
 the monument to this new kind of war would be these road and school hospital and home food and health
 we be ready in short to dedicate our strength to serve the need rather than the fear of the world
 we be ready by these and all such action to make of the united nations an institution that can effectively guard the peace and security of all people
 i know of nothing i can add to make plainer the sincere purpose of the united states
 i know of no course other than that mark by these and similar action that can be call the highway of peace
 i know of only one question upon which progress wait it be this
 what be the soviet union ready to do
 whatever the answer be let it be plainly speak
 again we say the hunger for peace be too great the hour in history too late for any government to mock man 's hope with mere word and promise and gesture
 the test of truth be simple there can be no persuasion but by deed
 be the new leadership of the soviet union prepare to use its decisive influence in the communist world include control of the flow of arm to bring not merely an expedient truce in korea but genuine peace in asia
 be it prepared to allow other nation include those of eastern europe the free choice of their own form of government
 be it prepared to act in concert with other upon serious disarmament proposal to be make firmly effective by stringent u.n. control and inspection
 if not where then be the concrete evidence of the soviet union 's concern for peace
 the test be clear
 there be before all people a precious chance to turn the black tide of event if we fail to strive to seize this chance the judgment of future age would be harsh and just
 if we strive but fail and the world remain armed against itself it at least need be divide no long in its clear knowledge of who have condemn humankind to this fate
 the purpose of the united states in state these proposal be simple and clear
 these proposal spring without ulterior purpose or political passion from our calm conviction that the hunger for peace be in the heart of all people those of russia and of china no less than of our own country
 they conform to our firm faith that god create man to enjoy not destroy the fruit of the earth and of their own toil
 they aspire to this the lifting from the back and from the heart of man of their burden of arm and of fear so that they may find before they a golden age of freedom and of peace

madame president members of the general assembly
 when secretary general hammarskjold 's invitation to address this general assembly reach i in bermuda i be just begin a series of conference with the prime ministers and foreign ministers of great britain and of france our subject be some of the problem that beset our world
 during the remainder of the bermuda conference i have constantly in mind that ahead of i lay a great honor that honor be mine today as i stand here privileged to address the general assembly of the united nations
 at the same time that i appreciate the distinction of address you i have a sense of exhilaration as i look upon this assembly
 never before in history have so much hope for so many people be gather together in a single organization your deliberation and decision during these somber year have already realize part of those hope
 but the great test and the great accomplishment still lie ahead and in the confident expectation of those accomplishment i would use the office which for the time be i hold to assure you that the government of the united states will remain steadfast in its support of this body this we shall do in the conviction that you will provide a great share of the wisdom the courage and the faith which can bring to this world last peace for all nation and happiness and well be for all man
 clearly it would not be fitting for i to take this occasion to present to you a unilateral american report on bermuda nevertheless i assure you that in our deliberation on that lovely island we seek to invoke those same great concept of universal peace and human dignity which be so clearly etch in your charter
 neither would it be a measure of this great opportunity merely to recite however hopefully pious platitude
 i therefore decide that this occasion warrant my saying to you some of the thing that have be on the mind and heart of my legislative and executive associate and on mine for a great many month thought i have originally plan to say primarily to the american people
 i know that the american people share my deep belief that if a danger exist in the world it be a danger share by all and equally that if hope exist in the mind of one nation that hope should be share by all
 finally if there be to be advance any proposal design to ease even by the small measure the tension of today 's world what more appropriate audience could there be than the member of the general assembly of the united nations
 i feel impel to speak today in a language that in a sense be new one which i who have spend so much of my life in the military profession would have prefer never to use
 that new language be the language of atomic warfare
 the atomic age have move forward at such a pace that every citizen of the world should have some comprehension at least in comparative term of the extent of this development of the utmost significance to every one of we clearly if the people of the world be to conduct an intelligent search for peace they must be arm with the significant fact of today 's existence
 my recital of atomic danger and power be necessarily state in united states term for these be the only incontrovertible fact that i know i need hardly point out to this assembly however that this subject be global not merely national in character
 on july 16 1945 the united states set off the world 's first atomic explosion since that date in 1945 the united states of america have conduct 42 test explosion
 atomic bomb today be more than 25 time as powerful as the weapon with which the atomic age dawn while hydrogen weapon be in the range of million of ton of tnt equivalent
 today the united states stockpile of atomic weapon which of course increase daily exceed by many time the explosive equivalent of the total of all bomb and all shell that come from every plane and every gun in every theatre of war in all of the year of world war ii
 a single air group whether afloat or land base can now deliver to any reachable target a destructive cargo exceed in power all the bomb that fall on britain in all of world war ii
 in size and variety the development of atomic weapon have be no less remarkable the development have be such that atomic weapon have virtually achieve conventional status within our armed service in the united states the army the navy the air force and the marine corps be all capable of put this weapon to military use
 but the dread secret and the fearful engine of atomic might be not ours alone
 in the first place the secret be possess by our friend and ally great britain and canada whose scientific genius make a tremendous contribution to our original discovery and the design of atomic bomb
 the secret be also know by the soviet union
 the soviet union have inform we that over recent year it have devote extensive resource to atomic weapon during this period the soviet union have explode a series of atomic device include at least one involve thermo nuclear reaction
 if at one time the united states possess what might have be call a monopoly of atomic power that monopoly cease to exist several year ago therefore although our early start have permit we to accumulate what be today a great quantitative advantage the atomic reality of today comprehend two fact of even great significance
 first the knowledge now possess by several nation will eventually be share by other possibly all other
 second even a vast superiority in number of weapon and a consequent capability of devastating retaliation be no preventive of itself against the fearful material damage and toll of human life that would be inflict by surprise aggression
 the free world at least dimly aware of these fact have naturally embark on a large program of warning and defense system that program will be accelerate and expand
 but let no one think that the expenditure of vast sum for weapon and system of defense can guarantee absolute safety for the city and citizen of any nation the awful arithmetic of the atomic bomb do not permit of any such easy solution even against the most powerful defense an aggressor in possession of the effective minimum number of atomic bomb for a surprise attack could probably place a sufficient number of his bomb on the choose target to cause hideous damage
 should such an atomic attack be launch against the united states our reaction would be swift and resolute but for i to say that the defense capability of the united states be such that they could inflict terrible loss upon an aggressor for i to say that the retaliation capability of the united states be so great that such an aggressor 's land would be lay waste all this while fact be not the true expression of the purpose and the hope of the united states
 to pause there would be to confirm the hopeless finality of a belief that two atomic colossi be doom malevolently to eye each other indefinitely across a trembling world to stop there would be to accept helplessly the probability of civilization destroy the annihilation of the irreplaceable heritage of mankind hand down to us generation from generation and the condemnation of mankind to begin all over again the age old struggle upward from savagery toward decency and right and justice
 surely no sane member of the human race could discover victory in such desolation could anyone wish his name to be couple by history with such human degradation and destruction
 occasional page of history do record the face of the great destroyers but the whole book of history reveal mankind 's never end quest for peace and mankind 's god give capacity to build
 it be with the book of history and not with isolated page that the united states will ever wish to be identify my country want to be constructive not destructive it want agreement not war among nation it want itself to live in freedom and in the confidence that the people of every other nation enjoy equally the right of choose their own way of life
 so my country 's purpose be to help we move out of the dark chamber of horror into the light to find a way by which the mind of man the hope of man the soul of man everywhere can move forward toward peace and happiness and well be
 in this quest i know that we must not lack patience
 i know that in a world divide such as ours today salvation can not be attain by one dramatic act
 i know that many step will have to be take over many month before the world can look at itself one day and truly realize that a new climate of mutually peaceful confidence be abroad in the world
 but i know above all else that we must start to take these step now
 the united states and its ally great britain and france have over the past month try to take some of these step let no one say that we shun the conference table
 on the record have long stand the request of the united states great britain and france to negotiate with the soviet union the problem of a divided germany
 on that record have long stand the request of the same three nation to negotiate an austrian peace treaty
 on the same record still stand the request of the united nations to negotiate the problem of korea
 most recently we have receive from the soviet union what be in effect an expression of willingness to hold a four power meeting along with our ally great britain and france we be pleased to see that this note do not contain the unacceptable precondition previously put forward
 as you already know from our joint bermuda communique the united states great britain and france have agree promptly to meet with the soviet union
 the government of the united states approach this conference with hopeful sincerity we will bend every effort of our mind to the single purpose of emerge from that conference with tangible result toward peace the only true way of lessen international tension
 we never have we never will propose or suggest that the soviet union surrender what be rightfully theirs
 we will never say that the people of russia be an enemy with whom we have no desire ever to deal or mingle in friendly and fruitful relationship
 on the contrary we hope that this come conference may initiate a relationship with the soviet union which will eventually bring about a free intermingling of the people of the east and of the west the one sure human way of develop the understanding require for confident and peaceful
 relation
 instead of the discontent which be now settle upon eastern germany occupy austria and the country of eastern europe we seek a harmonious family of free european nation with none a threat to the other and least of all a threat to the people of russia
 beyond the turmoil and strife and misery of asia we seek peaceful opportunity for these people to develop their natural resource and to elevate their life
 these be not idle word or shallow vision behind they lie a story of nation lately come to independence not as a result of war but through free grant or peaceful negotiation there be a record already write of assistance gladly give by nation of the west to needy people and to those suffer the temporary effect of famine drought and natural disaster
 these be deed of peace they speak more loudly than promise or protestation of peaceful intent
 but i do not wish to rest either upon the reiteration of past proposal or the restatement of past deed the gravity of the time be such that every new avenue of peace no matter how dimly discernible should be explore
 there be at least one new avenue of peace which have not yet be well explore an avenue now lay out by the general assembly of the united nations
 in its resolution of november 18th 1953 this general assembly suggest and i quote—"that the disarmament commission study the desirability of establish a sub committee consist of representative of the powers principally involve which should seek in private an acceptable solution and report on such a solution to the general assembly and to the security council not later than 1 september 1954
 the united states heed the suggestion of the general assembly of the united nations be instantly prepared to meet privately with such other country as may be principally involve to seek an acceptable solution to the atomic armament race which overshadow not only the peace but the very life of the world
 we shall carry into these private or diplomatic talk a new conception
 the united states would seek more than the mere reduction or elimination of atomic material for military purpose
 it be not enough to take this weapon out of the hand of the soldier it must be put into the hand of those who will know how to strip its military casing and adapt it to the art of peace
 the united states know that if the fearful trend of atomic military buildup can be reverse this great of destructive force can be develop into a great boon for the benefit of all mankind
 the united states know that peaceful power from atomic energy be no dream of the future that capability already prove be here now today who can doubt if the entire body of the world 's scientist and engineer have adequate amount of fissionable material with which to test and develop their idea that this capability would rapidly be transform into universal efficient and economic usage
 to hasten the day when fear of the atom will begin to disappear from the mind of people and the government of the east and west there be certain step that can be take now
 i therefore make the follow proposal
 the government principally involve to the extent permit by elementary prudence to begin now and continue to make joint contribution from their stockpile of normal uranium and fissionable material to an international atomic energy agency we would expect that such an agency would be set up under the aegis of the united nations
 the ratio of contribution the procedure and other detail would properly be within the scope of the private conversation i have refer to early
 the united states be prepared to undertake these exploration in good faith any partner of the united states act in the same good faith will find the united states a not unreasonable or ungenerous associate
 undoubtedly initial and early contribution to this plan would be small in quantity however the proposal have the great virtue that it can be undertake without the irritation and mutual suspicion incident to any attempt to set up a completely acceptable system of world wide inspection and control
 the atomic energy agency could be make responsible for the impounding storage and protection of the contribute fissionable and other material the ingenuity of our scientist will provide special safe condition under which such a bank of fissionable material can be make essentially immune to surprise seizure
 the more important responsibility of this atomic energy agency would be to devise method whereby this fissionable material would be allocate to serve the peaceful pursuit of mankind expert would be mobilize to apply atomic energy to the need of agriculture medicine and other peaceful activity a special purpose would be to provide abundant electrical energy in the power starve area of the world thus the contribute power would be dedicate some of their strength to serve the need rather than the fear of mankind
 the united states would be more than willing it would be proud to take up with other principally involve the development of plan whereby such peaceful use of atomic energy would be expedite
 of those principally involve the soviet union must of course be one
 i would be prepare to submit to the congress of the united states and with every expectation of approval any such plan that would
 first encourage world wide investigation into the most effective peacetime use of fissionable material and with the certainty that they have all the material need for the conduct of all experiment that be appropriate
 second begin to diminish the potential destructive power of the
 world 's atomic stockpile
 third allow all people of all nation to see that in this enlightened age the great power of the earth both of the east and of the west be interested in human aspiration first rather than in build up the armament of war
 fourth open up a new channel for peaceful discussion and initiate at least a new approach to the many difficult problem that must be solve in both private and public conversation if the world be to shake off the inertia impose by fear and be to make positive progress toward peace
 against the dark background of the atomic bomb the united states do not wish merely to present strength but also the desire and the hope for peace
 the come month will be fraught with fateful decision in this assembly in the capital and military headquarters of the world in the heart of man everywhere be they governor or govern may they be the decision which will lead this world out of fear and into peace
 to the making of these fateful decision the united states pledge before you and therefore before the world its determination to help solve the fearful atomic dilemma to devote its entire heart and mind to find the way by which the miraculous inventiveness of man shall not be dedicate to his death but consecrate to his life
 i again thank the delegate for the great honor they have do i in invite i to appear before they and in listen to i so courteously thank you

mr. president mr. speaker members of the eighty third congress it be a high honor again to present to the congress my view on the state of the union and to recommend measure to advance the security prosperity and well being of the american people all branch of this government and i venture to say both of our great party can support the general objective of the recommendation i make today for that objective be the building of a strong america a nation whose every citizen have good reason for bold hope where effort be reward and prosperity be share where freedom expand and peace be secure that be what i mean by a strong america toward this objective a real momentum have be develop during this administration 's first year in office we mean to continue that momentum and to increase it we mean to build a well future for this nation much for which we may be thankful have happen during the past year first of all we be deeply grateful that our son no long die on the distant mountain of korea although they be still call from our home to military service they be no long call to the field of battle the nation have just complete the most prosperous year in its history the damaging effect of inflation on the wage pension salary and saving of we all have be bring under control taxis have begin to go down the cost of our government have be reduce and its work proceed with some 183,000 few employee thus the discouraging trend of modern government toward their own limitless expansion have in our case be reverse the cost of armament become less oppressive as we near our defense goal yet we be militarily strong every day during the year creation of the new cabinet department of health education and welfare symbolize the government 's permanent concern with the human problem of our citizen segregation in the armed force and other federal activity be on the way out we have also make progress toward its elimination in the district of columbia these be step in the continue effort to eliminate inter racial difficulty some development beyond our shore have be equally encouraging communist aggression halt in korea continue to meet in indo china the vigorous resistance of france and the associated states assist by timely aid from our country in west germany in iran and in other area of the world hearten political victory have be win by the force of stability and freedom slowly but surely the free world gather strength meanwhile from behind the iron curtain there be sign that tyranny be in trouble and reminder that its structure be as brittle as its surface be hard there have be in fact a great strategic change in the world during the past year that precious intangible the initiative be become ours our policy not limit to mere reaction against crisis provoke by other be free to develop along line of our choice not only abroad but also at home as a major theme for american policy during the come year let our joint determination be to hold this new initiative and to use it we shall use this initiative to promote three broad purpose first to protect the freedom of our people second to maintain a strong grow economy third to concern ourselves with the human problem of the individual citizen only by active concern for each of these purpose can we be sure that we be on the forward road to a well and a strong america all my recommendation today be in furtherance of these three purpose i. foreign affairsamerican freedom be threaten so long as the world communist conspiracy exist in its present scope power and hostility more closely than ever before american freedom be interlock with the freedom of other people in the unity of the free world lie our good chance to reduce the communist threat without war in the task of maintain this unity and strengthen all its part the great responsibility fall naturally on those who like ourselves retain the most freedom and strength we shall therefore continue to advance the cause of freedom on foreign front in the far east we retain our vital interest in korea we have negotiate with the republic of korea a mutual security pact which develop our security system for the pacific and which i shall promptly submit to the senate for its consent to ratification we be prepared to meet any renewal of armed aggression in korea we shall maintain indefinitely our basis in okinawa i shall ask the congress to authorize continue material assistance to hasten the successful conclusion of the struggle in indo china this assistance will also bring close the day when the associated states may enjoy the independence already assure by france we shall also continue military and economic aid to the nationalist government of china in south asia profound change be take place in free nation which be demonstrate their ability to progress through democratic method they provide an inspiring contrast to the dictatorial method and backward course of event in communist china in these continue effort the free people of south asia can be assure of the support of the united states in the middle east where tension and serious problem exist we will show sympathetic and impartial friendship in western europe our policy rest firmly on the north atlantic treaty it will remain so base as far ahead as we can see within its organization the building of a united european community include france and germany be vital to a free and self reliant europe this will be promote by the european defense community which offer assurance of european security with the coming of unity to western europe the assistance this nation can render for the security of europe and the free world will be multiply in effectiveness in the western hemisphere we shall continue to develop harmonious and mutually beneficial cooperation with our neighbor indeed solid friendship with all our american neighbor be a cornerstone of our entire policy in the world as a whole the united nations admittedly still in a state of evolution mean much to the united states it have give uniquely valuable service in many place where violence threaten it be the only real world forum where we have the opportunity for international presentation and rebuttal it be a place where the nation of the world can if they have the will take collective action for peace and justice it be a place where the guilt can be squarely assign to those who fail to take all necessary step to keep the peace the united nations deserve our continue firm support foreign assistance and tradein the practical application of our foreign policy we enter the field of foreign assistance and trade military assistance must be continue technical assistance must be maintain economic assistance can be reduce however our economic program in korea and in a few other critical place of the world be especially important and i shall ask congress to continue they in the next fiscal year the forthcoming budget message will propose maintenance of the presidential power of transferability of all assistance fund and will ask authority to merge these fund with the regular defense fund it will also propose that the secretary of defense have primary responsibility for the administration of foreign military assistance in accordance with the policy guidance of the secretary of state the fact that we can now reduce our foreign economic assistance in many area be gratify evidence that its objective be be achieve by continue to surpass her prewar level of economic activity western europe gain self reliance thus our relationship enter a new phase which can bring result beneficial to our taxpayer and our ally alike if still another step be take this step be the creation of a healthy and free system of trade and payment within the free world a system in which our ally can earn their own way and our own economy can continue to flourish the free world can no long afford the kind of arbitrary restraint on trade that have continue ever since the war on this problem i shall submit to the congress detailed recommendation after our joint commission on foreign economic policy have make its report atomic energy proposalas we maintain our military strength during the come year and draw close the bond with our ally we shall be in an improved position to discuss outstanding issue with the soviet union indeed we shall be glad to do so whenever there be a reasonable prospect of constructive result in this spirit the atomic energy proposal of the united states be recently present to the united nations general assembly a truly constructive soviet reaction will make possible a new start toward an era of peace and away from the fatal road toward atomic war defensesince our hope be peace we owe ourselves and the world a candid explanation of the military measure we be take to make that peace secure as we enter this new year our military power continue to grow this power be for our own defense and to deter aggression we shall not be aggressor but we and our ally have and will maintain a massive capability to strike back here be some of the consideration in our defense planning first while determined to use atomic power to serve the usage of peace we take into full account our great and grow number of nuclear weapon and the most effective mean of use they against an aggressor if they be need to preserve our freedom our defense will be strong if under appropriate security safeguard we share with our ally certain knowledge of the tactical use of our nuclear weapon i urge the congress to provide the need authority second the usefulness of these new weapon create new relationship between man and material these new relationship permit economy in the use of man as we build force suit to our situation in the world today as will be see from the budget message on january 21 the airpower of our navy and air force be receive heavy emphasis third our armed force must regain maximum mobility of action our strategic reserve must be centrally place and readily deployable to meet sudden aggression against ourselves and our ally fourth our defense must rest on train manpower and its most economical and mobile use a professional corps be the heart of any security organization it be necessarily the teacher and leader of those who serve temporarily in the discharge of the obligation to help defend the republic pay alone will not retain in the career service of our armed force the necessary number of long term personnel i strongly urge therefore a more generous use of other benefit important to service morale among these be more adequate living quarter and family housing unit and medical care for dependent study of military manpower have just be complete by the national security training commission and a committee appoint by the director of the office of defense mobilization evident weakness exist in the state of readiness and organization of our reserve force measure to correct these weakness will be later submit to the congress fifth the ability to convert swiftly from partial to all out mobilization be imperative to our security for the first time mobilization official know what the requirement be for 1,000 major item need for military use these datum now be relate to civilian requirement and our supply potential will show we the gap in our mobilization base thus we shall have more realistic plant expansion and stockpile goal we shall speed their attainment this nation be at last to have an up to date mobilization base the foundation of a sound defense program another part of this foundation be of course our continental transport system some of our vital heavy material come increasingly from canada indeed our relation with canada happily always close involve more and more the unbreakable tie of strategic interdependence both nation now need the st. lawrence seaway for security as well as for economic reason i urge the congress promptly to approve our participation in its construction sixth military and non military measure for continental defense must be and be be strengthen in the current fiscal year we be allocate to these purpose an increase portion of our effort and in the next fiscal year we shall spend nearly a billion dollar more for they than in 1953.an indispensable part of our continental security be our civil defense effort this will succeed only as we have the complete cooperation of state governors mayors and voluntary citizen group with their help we can advance a cooperative program which if an attack should come would save many life and lessen destruction the defense program recommend in the 1955 budget be consistent with all of the consideration which i have just discuss it be base on a new military program unanimously recommend by the joint chiefs of staff and approve by i follow consideration by the national security council this new program will make and keep america strong in an age of peril nothing should bar its attainment the international and defense policy which i have outline will enable we to negotiate from a position of strength as we hold our resolute course toward a peaceful world we now turn to matter which be normally characterize as domestic well realize that what we do abroad affect every problem at home from the amount of taxis to our very state of mind internal securityunder the standard establish for the new employee security program more than 2,200 employee have be separate from the federal government our national security demand that the investigation of new employee and the evaluation of derogatory information respect present employee be expedite and conclude at the early possible date i shall recommend that the congress provide additional fund where necessary to speed these important procedure from the special employment standard of the federal government i turn now to a matter relate to american citizenship the subversive character of the communist party in the united states have be clearly demonstrate in many way include court proceeding we should recognize by law a fact that be plain to all thoughtful citizen that we be deal here with action akin to treason that when a citizen knowingly participate in the communist conspiracy he no long hold allegiance to the united states i recommend that congress enact legislation to provide that a citizen of the united states who be convict in the court of hereafter conspire to advocate the overthrow of this government by force or violence be treat as have by such act renounce his allegiance to the united states and forfeit his united states citizenship in addition the attorney general will soon appear before your committees to present his recommendation for need additional legal weapon with which to combat subversion in our country and to deal with the question of claimed immunity ii strong economyi turn now to the second great purpose of our government along with the protection of freedom the maintenance of a strong and grow economy the american economy be one of the wonder of the world it undergird our international position our military security and the standard of living of every citizen this administration be determined to keep our economy strong and to keep it grow at this moment we be in transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy i be confident that we can complete this transition without serious interruption in our economic growth but we shall not leave this vital matter to chance economic preparedness be fully as important to the nation as military preparedness subsequent special message and the economic report on january 28 will set forth plan of the administration and its recommendation for congressional action these will include flexible credit and debt management policy tax measure to stimulate consumer and business spending suitable lending guaranteeing insuring and grant in aid activity strengthen old age and unemployment insurance measure improve agricultural program public work plan lay well in advance enlarge opportunity for international trade and investment this mere enumeration of these subject imply the vast amount of study coordination and planning to say nothing of authorize legislation that altogether make our economic preparedness complete if new condition arise that require additional administrative or legislative action the administration will still be ready a government always ready as this be to take well time and vigorous action and a business community willing as our be to plan boldly and with confidence can between they develop a climate assure steady economic growth the budgeti shall submit to the congress on january 21 the first budget prepare by this administration for the period july 1 1954 through june 1955 this budget be adequate to the current need of the government it recognize that a federal budget should be a stabilize factor in the economy its tax and expenditure program will foster individual initiative and economic growth pende the transmittal of my budget message i shall mention here only a few point about our budgetary situation first one of our initial act be to revise with the cooperation of the congress the budget prepare before this administration take office request for new appropriation be greatly reduce in addition the spending level provide in that budget for the current fiscal year have be reduce by about $ 7,000,000,000 in the next fiscal year we estimate a further reduction in expenditure of more than $ 5,000,000,000 this will reduce the spending level over the two fiscal year by more than $ 12,000,000,000 we be also reduce furth our request for new appropriation second despite the substantial loss of revenue in the come fiscal year result from tax reduction now in effect and tax adjustment which i shall propose our reduced spending will move the new budget close to a balance third by keep new appropriation request below estimate revenue we continue to reduce the tremendous accumulation of unfinanced obligation incur by the government under past appropriation fourth until those claim on our government 's revenue be far reduce the growth in the public debt can not be entirely stop because of this because the government 's bill have to be pay every month while the tax money to pay they come in with great unevenness within the fiscal year and because of the need for flexibility to manage this enormous debt i find it necessary to renew my request for an increase in the statutory debt limit taxesthe new budget provide for a low level of taxation than have prevail in precede year six day ago individual income taxis be reduce and the excess profit tax expire these tax reduction be justify only because of the substantial reduction we already have make and be make in governmental expenditure as additional reduction in expenditure be bring gradually but surely into sight further reduction in taxis can and will be make when budget saving and sound governmental financing be assure tax burden should be reduce so that taxpayer may spend their own money in their own way while we be move toward low level of taxation we must thoroughly revise our whole tax system the groundwork for this revision have already be lay by the committee on ways and means of the house of representatives in close consultation with the department of the treasury we should now remove the more glaring tax inequity particularly on small taxpayer reduce restraint on the growth of small business and make other change that will encourage initiative enterprise and production twenty five recommendation toward these end will be contain in my budget message without attempt to summarize these manifold reform i can here illustrate their tendency for example we propose more liberal tax treatment for dependent child who work for widow or widower with dependent child and for medical expense for the business that want to expand or modernize its plant we propose liberalize tax treatment of depreciation research and development expense and retain earning because of the present need for revenue the corporation income tax should be keep at the current rate of 52 for another year and the excise taxis schedule to be reduce on april first include those on liquor tobacco gasoline and automobile should be continue at present rate immediate extension of the renegotiation act of 1951 be also need to eliminate excessive profit and to prevent waste of public fund in the purchase of defense material agriculturethe well being of our 160 million people demand a stable and prosperous agriculture conversely every farmer know he can not prosper unless all america prosper as we seek to promote increase in our standard of living we must be sure that the farmer fairly share in that increase therefore a farm program promote stability and prosperity in all element of our agriculture be urgently need agricultural law now in effect successfully accomplish their wartime purpose of encourage maximum production of many crop today production of these crop at such level far exceed present demand yet the law encourage such production be still in effect the storage facility of the commodity credit corporation bulge with surplus stock of dairy product wheat cotton corn and certain vegetable oil and the corporation 's presently authorize borrow authority--$6,750,000,000 -is nearly exhausted some product price out of domestic market and other price out of world market have pile up in government hand in a world in which million of people be hungry destruction of food would of course be unconscionable yet surplus stock continue to threaten the market and in spite of the acreage control authorize by present law surplus will continue to accumulate we confront two alternative the first be to impose still great acreage reduction for some crop and apply rigid federal control over the use of the divert acre this will regiment the production of every basic agricultural crop it will place every producer of those crop under the domination and control of the federal government in washington this alternative be contrary to the fundamental interest not only of the farmer but of the nation as a whole nor be it a real solution to the problem face we the second alternative be to permit the market price for these agricultural product gradually to have a great influence on the planning of production by farmer while continue the assistance of the government this be the sound approach to make it effective surplus exist when the new program begin must be insulate from the normal channel of trade for special use these use would include school lunch program disaster relief emergency assistance to foreign friend and of particular importance the stockpiling of reserve for a national emergency build on the agricultural law of 1948 and 1949 we should establish a price support program with enough flexibility to attract the production of need supply of essential commodity and to stimulate the consumption of those commodity that be flood american market transition to modernize parity must be accomplish gradually in no case should there be an abrupt downward change in the dollar level or in the percentage level of price support next monday i shall transmit to the congress my detailed recommendation embody this approach they have be develop through the cooperation of innumerable individual vitally interested in agriculture my special message on monday will briefly describe the consultative and advisory process to which this whole program have be subject during the past ten month i have choose this farm program because it will build market protect the consumer food supply and move food into consumption instead of into storage it be a program that will remove the threat to the farmer of these overhang surplus a program also that will stimulate production when a commodity be scarce and encourage consumption when nature be bountiful moreover it will promote the individual freedom responsibility and initiative which distinguish american agriculture and by help our agriculture achieve full parity in the market it promise our farmer a high and steady financial return over the year than any alternative plan conservationpart of our nation 's precious heritage be its natural resource it be the common responsibility of federal state and local government to improve and develop they always work in the close harmony and partnership all federal conservation and resource development project be be reappraise sound project now under way will be continue new project in which the federal government have a part must be economically sound with local sharing of cost wherever appropriate and feasible in the next fiscal year work will be start on twenty three project that meet these standard the federal government will continue to construct and operate economically sound flood control power irrigation and water supply project wherever these project be beyond the capacity of local initiative public or private and consistent with the need of the whole nation our conservation program will also take into account the important role play by farmer in protect our soil resource i recommend enactment of legislation to strengthen agricultural conservation and upstream flood prevention work and to achieve a well balance with major flood control structure in the down stream area recommendation will be make from time to time for the adoption of a uniform and consistent water resource policy;a revise public land policy anda sound program for safeguard the domestic production of critical and strategic metal and mineral in

adequate highway system the federal government be continue its central role in the federal aid highway program so that maximum progress can be make to overcome present inadequacy in the interstate highway system we must continue the federal gasoline tax at two cent per gallon this will require cancellation of the ½¢ decrease which otherwise will become effective april 1st and will maintain revenue so that an expand highway program can be undertake when the commission on intergovernmental relations complete its study of the present system of finance highway construction i shall promptly submit it for consideration by the congress and the governor of the state post officeit be apparent that the substantial saving already make and to be make by the post office department can not eliminate the postal deficit i recommend therefore that the congress approve the bill now pende in the house of representatives provide for the adjustment of certain postal rate to handle the long term aspect of this i also recommend that the congress create a permanent commission to establish fair and reasonable postal rate from time to time in the future iii human problemsalong with the protection of freedom and maintenance of a strong and grow economy this administration recognize a third great purpose of government concern for the human problem of our citizen in a modern industrial society banishment of destitution and cushion the shock of personal disaster on the individual be proper concern of all level of government include the federal government this be especially true where remedy and prevention alike be beyond the individual 's capacity labor and welfareof the many problem in this area those i shall first discuss be of particular concern to the member of our great labor force who with their head heart and hand produce so much of the wealth of our country protection against the hazard of temporary unemployment should be extend to some 6½ million of worker include civilian federal worker who now lack this safeguard moreover the secretary of labor be make available to the state study and recommendation in the field of weekly benefit period of protection and extension of coverage the economic report will consider the related matter of minimum wage and their coverage the labor management relations act of 3947 be basically a sound law however six year of experience have reveal that in some respect it can be improve on january 11 i shall forward to the congress suggestion for change design to reinforce the basic objective of the act our basic social security program the old age and survivors insurance system to which individual contribute during their productive year and receive benefit base on previous earning be design to shield they from destitution last year i recommend extension of the social insurance system to include more than 10,000,000 additional person i ask that this extension soon be accomplish this and other major improvement in the insurance system will bring substantial benefit increase and broaden the membership of the insurance system thus diminish the need for federal grant in aid for such purpose a new formula will therefore be propose permit progressive reduction in such grant as the need for they decline federal grant in aid welfare program now base on widely vary formula should be simplify concrete proposal on fourteen of they will be suggest to the appropriate committees the program for rehabilitation of the disabled especially need strengthen through special vocational training this

increase my more detailed recommendation on this and the other social insurance problem i have mention will be send to the congress on january 14th healthi be flatly oppose to the socialization of medicine the great need for hospital and medical service can well be meet by the initiative of private plan but it be unfortunately a fact that medical cost be rise and already impose severe hardship on many family the federal government can do many helpful thing and still carefully avoid the socialization of medicine the federal government should encourage medical research in its battle with such mortal disease as cancer and heart ailment and should continue to help the state in their health and rehabilitation program the present hospital survey and construction act should be broaden in order to assist in the development of adequate facility for the chronically ill and to encourage the construction of diagnostic center rehabilitation facility and nursing home the war on disease also need a well work relationship between government and private initiative private and non profit hospital and medical insurance plan be already in the field soundly base on the experience and initiative of the

direction of public education policy be a state and local responsibility however the federal government should stand ready to assist state which demonstrably can not provide sufficient school building in order to appraise the need i hope that this year a conference on education will be hold in each state culminate in a national conference from these conference on education every level of government from the federal government to each local school board should gain the information with which to attack this serious problem housingthe detail of a program to enlarge and improve the opportunity for

citizen to vote when they reach the age of 18.conclusioni want to add one final word about the general purport of these many recommendation our government 's power be wisely limit by the constitution but quite apart from those limitation there be thing which no government can do or should try to do a government can strive as ours be strive to maintain an economic system whose door be open to enterprise and ambition those personal quality on which economic growth largely depend but enterprise and ambition be quality which no government can supply fortunately no american government need concern itself on this score our people have these quality in good measure a government can sincerely strive for peace as ours be strive and ask its people to make sacrifice for the sake of peace but no government can place peace in the heart of foreign ruler it be our duty then to ourselves and to freedom itself to remain strong in all those way spiritual economic military that will give we maximum safety against the possibility of aggressive action by other no government can inoculate its people against the fatal materialism that plague our age happily our people though bless with more material good than any people in history have always reserve their first allegiance to the kingdom of the spirit which be the true source of that freedom we value above all material thing but a government can try as ours try to sense the deep aspiration of the people and to express they in political action at home and abroad so long as action and aspiration humbly and earnestly seek favor in the sight of the almighty there be no end to america 's forward road there be no obstacle on it she will not surmount in her march toward a last peace in a free and prosperous world note this be the

be of the utmost importance that each of we understand the true nature of the struggle now take place in the world it be not a struggle merely of economic theory or of form of government or of military power at issue be the true nature of man either man be the creature whom the psalmist describe as a little low than the angel crown with glory and honor hold dominion over the work of his creator or man be a soulless animate machine to be enslave use and consume by the state for its own glorification it be therefore a struggle which go to the root of the human spirit and its shadow fall across the long sweep of man 's destiny this prize so precious so fraught with ultimate meaning be the true object of the contend force in the world in the past year there have be progress justify hope both for continue peace and for the ultimate rule of freedom and justice in the world free nation be collectively strong than at any time in recent year just as nation of this hemisphere

more effectively with other nation for the well being the freedom the dignity of every human on earth these development be hearten indeed and we be hopeful of continue progress but sober problem remain the massive military machine and ambition of the soviet communist bloc still create uneasiness in the world all of we be aware of the continue reliance of the soviet communists on military force of the power of their weapon of their present resistance to realistic armament limitation and of their continue effort to dominate or intimidate free nation on their periphery their steadily grow power include an increase strength in nuclear weapon this power combine with the proclaim intention of the communist leader to communize the world be the threat confront we today to protect our nation and our people from the catastrophe of a nuclear holocaust free nation must maintain countervail military power to persuade the communists of the futility of seek their end through aggression if communist ruler understand that america 's response to aggression will be swift and decisive that never shall we buy peace at the expense of honor or faith they will be powerfully deter from launch a military venture engulf their own people and many other in disaster this of course be merely world stalemate but in this stalemate each of we may and must exercise his high duty to strive in every honorable way for endure peace the military threat be but one menace to our freedom and security we must not only deter aggression we must also frustrate the effort of communists to gain their goal by subversion to this end free nation must maintain and reinforce their cohesion their internal security their political and economic vitality and their faith in freedom in such a world america 's course be dear we must tirelessly labor to make the peace more just and durable we must strengthen the collective defense under the united nations charter and gird ourselves with sufficient military strength and productive capacity to discourage resort to war and protect our nation 's vital interest we must continue to support and strengthen the united nations at this very moment by vote of the united nations general assembly its secretary general be in communist china on a mission of deep concern to all americans seek the release of our never to be forget american aviator and all other united nations prisoner wrongfully detain by the communist regime we must also encourage the effort be make in the united nations to limit armament and to harness the atom to peaceful rise we must expand international trade and investment and assist friendly nation whose own good effort be still insufficient to provide the strength essential to the security of the free world we must be willing to use the process of negotiation whenever they will advance the cause of just and secure peace to which the united states and other free nation be dedicate in respect to all these matter we must through a vigorous information program keep the people of the world truthfully advise of our action and purpose this problem have be attack with new vigor during the past month i urge that the congress give its earnest consideration to the great advantage that can accrue to our country through the successful operation of this program we must also carry forward our educational exchange program this sharing of knowledge and experience between our citizen and those of free country be a powerful factor in the development and maintenance of true partnership among free people to advance these many effort the congress must act in this session on appropriation legislation and treaty today i shall mention especially our foreign economic and military program the recent economic progress in many free nation have be most heartening the productivity of labor and the production of good and service be increase in ever widen area there be a grow will to improve the living standard of all man this progress be important to all our people it promise we ally who be strong and self reliant it promise a grow world market for the product of our mine our factory and our farm but only through steady effort can we hope to continue this progress barrier still impede trade and the flow of capital need to develop each nation 's human and material resource wise reduction of these barrier be a long term objective of our foreign economic policy a policy of an evolutionary and selective nature assure broad benefit to our own and other people we must gradually reduce certain tariff obstacle to trade these action should of course be accompany by a similar lowering of trade barrier by other nation so that we may move steadily toward great economic advantage for all we must far simplify custom administration and procedure we must facilitate the flow of capital and continue technical assistance both directly and through the united nations to less develop country to strengthen their independence and raise their living standard many another step must be take in and among the nation of the free world to release force of private initiative in our own nation these force have bring strength and prosperity once release they will generate rise income in these other country with which to buy the product of american industry labor and agriculture on january 10 by special message i shall submit specific recommendation for carry forward the legislative phase of our foreign economic policy our many effort to build a well world include the maintenance of our military strength this be a vast undertaking major national security program consume two third of the entire federal budget over four million americans serviceman and civilian be on the roll of the defense establishment during the past two year by eliminate duplication and overstaffing by improved procurement and inventory control and by concentrate on the essential many billion of dollar have be save in our defense activity i should like to mention certain fundamental underlie this vast program first a realistic limitation of armament and an endure just peace remain our national goal we maintain powerful military force because there be no present alternative force design for deterrent and defensive purpose alone but able instantly to strike back with destructive power in response to an attack second we must stay alert to the fact that undue reliance on one weapon or preparation for only one kind of warfare simply invite an enemy to resort to another we must therefore keep in our armed force balance and flexibility adequate for our purpose and objective third to keep our armed force abreast of the advance of science our military planning must be flexible enough to utilize the new weapon and technique which flow ever more speedily from our research and development program the forthcoming military budget therefore emphasize modern airpower in the air force navy and marine corps and increase the emphasis on new weapon especially those of rapid and destructive striking power it assure the maintenance of effective retaliatory force as the principal deterrent to overt aggression it accelerate the continental defense program and the build up of ready military reserve force it continue a vigorous program of stockpile strategic and critical material and strengthen our mobilization base the budget also contemplate the strategic concentration of our strength through redeployment of certain force it provide for reduction of force in certain category and their expansion in other to fit they to the military reality of our time these emphasis in our defense planning have be make at my personal direction after long and thoughtful study in my judgment they will give our nation a defense accurately adjust to the national need fourth pende a world agreement on armament limitation we must continue to improve and expand our supply of nuclear weapon for our land naval and air force while at the same time continue our encouraging progress in the peaceful use of atomic power and fifth in the administration of these costly program we must demand the utmost in efficiency and ingenuity we must assure our people not only of adequate protection but also of a defense that can be carry forward from year to year until the threat of aggression have disappear to help maintain this kind of armed strength and improve its efficiency i must urge the enactment of several important measure in this session the first concern the selective service act which expire next june 30th for the foreseeable future our stand force must remain much large than voluntary method can sustain we must therefore extend the statutory authority to induct man for two year of military service the second kind of measure concern the rapid turnover of our most experienced servicemen this process seriously weaken the combat readiness of our armed force and be exorbitantly expensive to encourage more train serviceman to remain in uniform i shall on the thirteenth of this month propose a number of measure to increase the attraction of a military career these measure will include more adequate medical care for dependent survivor benefit more and well housing and selective adjustment in military pay and other allowance and third also on january 13 -i shall present a program to rebuild and strengthen the civilian component of our armed force this be a comprehensive program design to make well use of our manpower of military age because it will go far in assure fair and equitable participation in military training and service it be of particular importance to our combat veteran in keep with the historic military policy of our republic this program be design to build and maintain powerful civilian reserve immediately capable of effective military service in an emergency in lieu of maintain active duty force in excess of the nation 's immediate need maintenance of an effective defense require continuance of our aggressive attack on subversion at home in this effort we have in the past two year make excellent progress fbi investigation have be powerfully reinforce by a new internal security division in the department of justice the security activity of the immigration and naturalization service have be revitalize an improved and strengthen security system be in effect throughout the government the department of justice and the fbi have be arm with effective new legal weapon forge by the 83rd congress we shall continue to ferret out and to destroy communist subversion we shall in the process carefully preserve our tradition and the basic right of our citizen our civil defense program be also a key element in the protection of our country we be develop cooperative method with state governors mayors and voluntary citizen group as well as among federal agency in build the civil defense organization its significance in time of war be obvious its swift assistance in disaster area last year prove its importance in time of peace an industry capable of rapid expansion and essential material and facility swiftly available in time of emergency be indispensable to our defense i urge therefore a two year extension of the defense production act and title ii of the first war powers act of 1941 these be cornerstone of our program for the development and maintenance of an adequate mobilization base at this point i should like to make this additional observation our quest for peace and freedom necessarily presume that we who hold position of public trust must rise above self and section that we must subordinate to the general good our partisan our personal pride and prejudice tirelessly with united purpose we must fortify the material and spiritual foundation of this land of freedom and of free nation throughout the world as never before there be need for unhesitate cooperation among the branch of our government at this time the executive and legislative branch be under the management of different political party this fact place both party on trial before the american people in less perilous day of the past division of governmental responsibility among our great party have produce a paralyze indecision we must not let this happen in our time we must avoid a paralysis of the will for peace and international security in the traditionally bipartisan area military security and foreign relation i can report to you that i have already with the leader of this congress express assurance of unreserved cooperation yet the strength of our country require more than mere maintenance of military strength and success in foreign affair these vital matter be in turn dependent upon concerted and vigorous action in a number of support program i say therefore to the 84th congress in all area basic to the strength of america there will be to the extent i can insure they cooperative constructive relation between the executive and legislative branches of this government let the general good be our yardstick on every great issue of our time our effort to defend our freedom and to secure a just peace be of course inseparable from the second great purpose of our government to help maintain a strong grow economy an economy vigorous and free in which there be ever increase opportunity just reward for effort and a stable prosperity that be widely share in the past two year many important governmental actions help our economy adjust to condition of peace these and other action create a climate for renew economic growth control be remove from wage price and material tax revision encourage increase private spending and employment federal expenditure be sharply reduce make possible a record tax cut these action together with flexible monetary and debt management policy help to halt inflation and stabilize the value of the dollar a program of cooperation and partnership in resource development be begin social security and unemployment insurance law be broaden and strengthen new law start the long process of balance farm production with farm market expand shipbuilding and stockpile program strengthen key sector of the economy while improve our mobilization base a comprehensive new housing law bring impressive progress in an area fundamental to our economic strength and closed loophole in the old law permit dishonest manipulation many of these program be just begin to exert their main stimulating effect upon the economy generally and upon specific community and industry throughout the country the past year--1954 -was one of the most prosperous year in our history business activity now surge with new strength production be rise employment be high toward the end of last year average weekly wage in manufacturing be high than ever before personal income after taxis be at a record level so be consumer spending construction activity be reach new peak export demand for our good be strong state and local government expenditure on public work be rise saving be high and credit be readily available so today the transition to a peacetime economy be largely behind we the economic outlook be good the many promising factor i have mention do not guarantee sustained economic expansion however they do give we a strong position from which to carry forward our economic growth if we as a people act wisely within ten year our annual national output can rise from its present level of about $ 360 billion to $ 500 billion measure in dollar of stable buying power my budget message on january 17 the economic report on the 20th of this month and several special message will set forth in detail major program to foster the growth of our economy and to protect the integrity of the people 's money today i shall discuss these program only in general term government efficiency and economy remain essential to steady progress toward a balanced budget more than ten billion dollar be cut from the spending program propose in the budget of january 9 1953 expenditure of that year be six and a half billion below those of the previous year in the current fiscal year government spending will be nearly four and a half billion dollar less than in the fiscal year which end last june 30 new spending authority have be hold below expenditure reduce government obligation accumulate over the year last year we have a large tax cut and for the first time in seventy five year a basic revision of federal tax law it be now clear that defense and other essential government cost must remain at a level preclude further tax reduction this year although excise and corporation income taxis must therefore be continue at their present rate further tax cut will be possible when justify by low expenditure and by revenue increase arise from the nation 's economic growth i be hopeful that such reduction can be make next year at the foundation of our economic growth be the raw material and energy produce from our mineral and fuel land and forest and water resource with respect to they i believe that the nation must adhere to three fundamental policy first to develop wisely use and conserve basic resource from generation to generation second to follow the historic pattern of develop these resource primarily by private citizen under fair provision of law include restraint for proper conservation and third to treat resource development as a partnership undertaking a partnership in which the participation of private citizen and state and local government be as necessary as federal participation this policy of partnership and cooperation be produce good result most immediately noticeable in respect to water resource first it have encourage local public body and private citizen to plan their own power source increase number of application to the federal power commission to conduct survey and prepare plan for power development notably in the columbia river basin be evidence of local response second the federal government and local and private organization have be encourage to coordinate their development this be important because federal hydroelectric development supply but a small fraction of the nation 's power need such partnership project as priest rapids in washington the coosa river development in alabama and markham ferry in oklahoma already have the approval of the congress this year justifiable project of a similar nature will again have administration support third the federal government must shoulder its own partnership obligation by undertake project of such complexity and size that their success require federal development in keep with this principle i again urge the congress to approve the development of the upper colorado river basin to conserve and assure well use of precious water essential to the future of the west in addition the 1956 budget will recommend appropriation to start six new reclamation and more than thirty new corps of engineers project of vary size go project and investigation of potential new resource development will be continue although this partnership approach be produce encouraging result its full success require a nation wide comprehensive water resource policy firmly base in law such a policy be under preparation and when complete will be submit to the congress in the interest of their proper conservation development and use continue vigilance will be maintain over our fishery wildlife resource the national park and forest and the public land and we shall continue to encourage an orderly development of the nation 's mineral resource a modern efficient highway system be essential to meet the need of our grow population our expand economy and our national security we be accelerate our highway improvement program as rapidly as possible under exist state and federal law and authorization however this effort will not in itself assure our people of an adequate highway system on my recommendation this problem have be carefully consider by the conference of state governors and by a special advisory committee on a national highway program compose of lead private citizen i have receive the recommendation of the governors conference and will shortly receive the view of the special advisory committee aid by their finding i shall submit on january 27th detailed recommendation which will meet our most pressing national highway need in further recognition of the importance of transportation to our economic strength and security the administration through a cabinet committee be thoroughly examine exist federal transportation policy to determine their effect on the adequacy of transportation service this be the first such comprehensive review directly undertake by the executive branch of the government in modern time we be not only examine major problem face the various mode of transport we be also study closely the inter relationship of civilian and government requirement for transportation legislation will be recommend to correct policy deficiency which we may find the nation 's public work activity be tremendous in scope it be expect that more than $ 12 billion will be expend in 1955 for the development of land water and other resource control of flood and navigation and harbor improvement construction of road school and municipal water supply and disposal of domestic and industrial waste many of the federal state and local agency responsible for this work be in their separate capacity highly efficient but public work activity be closely inter related and have a substantial influence on the growth of the country moreover in time of threaten economic contraction they may become a valuable sustain force to these end efficient planning and execution of the nation 's public work require both the coordination of federal activity and effective cooperation with state and local government the council of economic advisers through its public work planning section have make important advance during the past year in effect this coordination and cooperation in view of the success of these initial effort and to give more emphasis and continuity to this essential coordination i shall request the congress to appropriate fund for the support of an office of coordinator of public works in the executive office of the president a most significant element in our grow economy be an agriculture that be stable prosperous and free the problem of our agriculture have evolve over many year and can not be solve overnight nevertheless governmental action last year hold great promise of foster a well balance between production and market and consequently a well and more stable income for our farmer through vigorous administration and through new authority provide by the 83rd congress surplus farm product be now move into consumption from february 1953 through november 1954 the rate of increase of government hold surplus have be reduce by our move into use more than 2.3 billion dollar worth of government own farm commodity this amount be equal to more than seven percent of a year 's production of all our farm and ranch domestic consumption remain high and farm export will be high than last year as a result of the flexibility provide by the agricultural act of 1954 we can move toward less restrictive acreage control thus farm production be gradually adjust to market market be be expand and stock be move into use we can now look forward to an easing of the influence depress farm price to reduce government expenditure for purchase of surplus product and to less federal intrusion into the life and plan of our farm people agricultural program have be redirect toward well balance great stability and sustained prosperity we be head in the right direction i urgently recommend to the congress that we continue resolutely on this road great attention must be direct to the need of low income farm family twenty eight per cent of our farm operator family have net cash income of less than $ 1,000 per year last year at my request careful study be make of the problem of these farm people i shall later submit recommendation design to assure the steady alleviation of their most pressing concern because drought also remain a serious agricultural problem i shall recommend legislation to strengthen federal disaster assistance program this legislation will prescribe an improved appraisal of need well adjustment of the various program to local condition and a more equitable sharing of cost between the states and the federal government the prosperity of our small business enterprise be an indispensable element in the maintenance of our economic strength creation of the small business administration and recently enact tax

light the administration have continue work on its program for the republic begin three year ago because the vast spread of national and human interest be involve within it i shall not in this message attempt its detailed delineation instead from time to time during this session there will be submit to the congress specific recommendation within specific field in the comprehensive survey require for their preparation the administration be guide by endure objective the first be the discharge of our world responsibilityour world policy and our action be dedicate to the achievement of peace with justice for all nation with this purpose we move in a wide variety of way and through many agency to remove the pall of fear to strengthen the tie with our partner and to improve the cooperative cohesion of the free world to reduce the burden of armament and to stimulate and inspire action among all nation for a world of justice and prosperity and peace these national objective be fully support by both our political party in the past year our search for a more stable and just peace have take varied form among the most important be the two conferences at geneva in july and in the fall of last year we explore the possibility of agreement on critical issue that jeopardize the peace the july meeting of heads of government hold out promise to the world of moderation in the bitterness of word and action which tend to generate conflict and war all be in agreement that a nuclear war would be an intolerable disaster which must not be permit to occur but in october when the foreign ministers meet again the result demonstrate conclusively that the soviet leader be not yet willing to create the indispensable condition for a secure and last peace nevertheless it be clear that the conflict between international communism and freedom have take on a new complexion we know the communist leader have often practice the tactic of retreat and zigzag we know that soviet and chinese communism still pose a serious threat to the free world and in the middle east recent soviet move be hardly compatible with the reduction of international tension yet communist tactic against the free nation have shift in emphasis from reliance on violence and the threat of violence to reliance on division enticement and duplicity we must be well prepared to meet the current tactic which pose a dangerous though less obvious threat at the same time our policy must be dynamic as well as flexible design primarily to forward the achievement of our own objective rather than to meet each shift and change on the communist front we must act in the firm assurance that the fruit of freedom be more attractive and desirable to mankind in the pursuit of happiness than the record of communism in the face of communist military power we must of course continue to maintain an effective system of collective security this involve two thing a system which give clear warning that armed aggression will be meet by joint action of the free nation and deterrent military power to make that warn effective moreover the awesome power of the atom must be make to serve as a guardian of the free community and of the peace in the last year the free world have see major gain for the system of collective security the accession to the north atlantic treaty organization and western european union of the sovereign federal german republic the develop cooperation under the southeast asia collective defense treaty and the formation in the middle east of the baghdad pact among turkey iraq iran pakistan and the united kingdom in our own hemisphere the inter american system have continue to show its vitality in maintain peace and a common approach to world problem we now have security pact with more than 40 other nation in the pursuit of our national purpose we have be steadfast in our support of the united nations now enter its second decade with a wide membership and ever increase influence and usefulness in the release of our fifteen flier from communist china an essential prelude be the world opinion mobilize by the general assembly which condemn their imprisonment and demand their liberation the successful atomic energy conference hold in geneva under united nations auspex and our atoms for peace program have be practical step toward the world wide use of this new energy source our sponsorship of such use have benefit our relation with other country active negotiation be now in progress to create an international agency to foster peaceful use of atomic energy during the past year the crucial problem of disarmament have move to the forefront of practical political endeavor at geneva i declare the readiness of the united states to exchange blueprint of the military establishment of our nation and the ussr to be confirm by reciprocal aerial reconnaissance by this means i feel mutual suspicion could be allay and an atmosphere develop in which negotiation look toward limitation of arm would have improve chance of success in the united nations subcommittee on disarmament last fall this proposal be explore and the united states also declare itself willing to include reciprocal ground inspection of key point by the overwhelming vote of 56 to 7 the united nations on december 16 endorse these proposal and give they a top priority thereby the issue be place squarely before the bar of world opinion we shall persevere in seek a general reduction of armament under effective inspection and control which be essential safeguard to ensure reciprocity and protect the security of all in the come year much remain to be do while maintain our military deterrent we must intensify our effort to achieve a just peace in asia we shall continue to give help to nation struggle to maintain their freedom against the threat of communist coercion or subversion in europe we shall endeavor to increase not only the military strength of the north atlantic alliance but also its political cohesion and unity of purpose we shall give such assistance as be feasible to the recently renew effort of western european nation to achieve a great measure of integration such as in the field of peaceful use of atomic energy in the near east we shall spare no effort in seek to promote a fair solution of the tragic dispute between the arab states and israel all of whom we want as our friend the united states be ready to do its part to assure endure peace in that area we hope that both side will make the contribution necessary to achieve that purpose in latin america we shall continue to cooperate vigorously in trade and other measure design to assist economic progress in the area strong economic tie be an essential element in our free world partnership increase trade and investment help all of we prosper together gratifying progress have be make in this direction most recently by the three year extension of our trade agreement legislation i most earnestly request that the congress approve our membership in the organization for trade cooperation which would assist the carrying out of the general agreement on tariffs and trade to which we have be a party since 1948 our membership in the otc will provide the most effective and expeditious mean for remove discrimination and restriction against american export and in make our trade agreement truly reciprocal united states membership in the organization will evidence our continue desire to cooperate in promote an expand trade among the free nation thus the organization as propose be admirably suit to our own interest and to those of like minded nation in work for steady expansion of trade and close economic cooperation be strictly an administrative entity the organization for trade cooperation can not of course alter the control by congress of the tariff import and custom policy of the united states we need to encourage investment overseas by avoid unfair tax duplication and to foster foreign trade by further simplification and improvement of our custom legislation we must sustain and fortify our mutual security program because the condition of poverty and unrest in less develop area make their people a special target of international communism there be a need to help they achieve the economic growth and stability necessary to preserve their independence against communist threat and enticement in order that our friend may well achieve the great strength that be our common goal they need assurance of continuity in economic assistance for development project and program which we approve and which require a period of year for planning and completion accordingly i ask congress to grant limited authority to make long term commitment for assistance to such project to be fulfil from appropriation to be make in future fiscal year these various step will powerfully strengthen the economic foundation of our foreign policy together with constructive action abroad they will maintain the present momentum toward general economic progress and vitality of the free world in all thing change be the inexorable law of life in much of the world the ferment of change be work strongly but grave injustice be still uncorrected we must not by any sanction of ours help to perpetuate these wrong i have particularly in mind the oppressive division of the german people the bondage of million elsewhere and the exclusion of japan from united nations membership we shall keep these injustice in the forefront of human consciousness and seek to maintain the pressure of world opinion to fight these vast wrong in the interest both of justice and secure peace injustice thrive on ignorance because an understanding of the truth about america be one of our most powerful force i be recommend a substantial increase in budgetary support of the united states information agency the sum of our international effort should be this the waging of peace with as much resourcefulness with as great a sense of dedication and urgency as we have ever muster in defense of our country in time of war in this effort our weapon be not force our weapon be the principle and idea embody in our historic tradition apply with the same vigor that in the past make america a live promise of freedom for all mankind to accomplish these vital task all of we should be concern with the strength effectiveness and morale .of our state department and our foreign service another guide in the preparation of the administration 's program be the constant improvement of our national securitybecause peace be the keystone of our national policy our defense program emphasize an effective flexible type of power calculate to deter or repulse any aggression and to preserve the peace short of war we have never have military strength well adapt to our need with improve readiness for emergency use the maintenance of this strong military capability for the indefinite future will continue to call for a large share of our national budget our military program must meet the need of today to build less would expose the nation to aggression to build excessively under the influence of fear could defeat our purpose and impair or destroy the very freedom and economic system our military defense be design to protect we have improve the effectiveness and combat readiness of our force by develop and make operational new weapon and by integrate the late scientific development include new atomic weapon into our military plan we continue to push the production of the most modern military aircraft the development of long range missile have be on an accelerated basis for some time we be move as rapidly as practicable toward nuclear power aircraft and ship combat capability especially in term of firepower have be substantially increase we have make the adjustment in personnel permit by the cessation of the korean war the buildup of our ally and the introduction of new weapon the service be all plan realistically on a long term basis to strengthen our continental defense the united states and canada in the close cooperation have substantially augment early warning network great progress be be make in extend surveillance of the arctic the atlantic and the pacific approach to north america in the last analysis our real strength lie in the caliber of the man and woman in our armed forces active and reserve much have be do to attract and hold capable military personnel but more need to be do this year i renew my request of last year for legislation to provide proper medical care for military dependent and a more equitable survivor benefit program the administration will prepare additional recommendation design to achieve the same objective include career incentive for medical and dental officer and nurse and increase in the proportion of regular officer closely related to the mission of the defense department be the task of the federal civil defense administration a particular point of relationship arise from the fact that the key to civil defense be the expand continental defense program include the distant early warning system our federal civil defense authority have make progress in their program and now comprehensive study be be conduct jointly by the federal civil defense administration the states and critical target city to determine the good procedure that can be adopt in case of an atomic attack we must strengthen federal assistance to the states and city in devise the most effective common defense we have a broad and diversified mobilization base we have the facility material skill and knowledge rapidly to expand the production of thing we need for our defense whenever they be require but mobilization base requirement change with change technology and strategy we must maintain flexibility to meet new requirement i be request therefore that the congress once again extend the defense production act of great importance to our nation 's security be a continue alertness to internal subversive activity within or without our government this administration will not relax its effort to deal forthrightly and vigorously in protection of this government and its citizen against subversion at the same time fully protect the constitutional right of all citizen a third objective of the administration be fiscal integritya public office be indeed a public trust none of its aspect be more demanding than the proper management of the public finance i refer now not only to the indispensable virtue of plain honesty and trustworthiness but also to the prudent effective and conscientious use of tax money i refer also to the attitude of mind that make efficient and economical service to the people a watchword in our government over the long term a balanced budget be a sure index to thrifty management in a home in a business or in the federal government when achievement of a balanced budget be for long put off in a business or home bankruptcy be the result but in similar circumstance a government resort to inflation of the money supply this inevitably result in depreciation of the value of the money and an increase in the cost of living every investment in personal security be threaten by this process of inflation and the real value of the people 's saving whether in the form of insurance bond pension and retirement fund or saving account be thereby shrivel we have make long stride these past three year in bring our federal finance under control the deficit for fiscal year 1953 be almost 9 1/2 billion dollar large deficit seem certain deficit which would have depreciate the value of the dollar and push the cost of live still higher but government waste and extravagance be search out nonessential activity be drop government expense be carefully scrutinize total spending be cut by 14 billion dollar below the amount plan by the previous administration for the fiscal year 1954.this make possible and it be appropriate in the exist circumstance of transition to a peacetime economy the large tax cut in any year in our history almost 7-½ billion dollar be release and every taxpayer in the country benefit almost two third of the saving go directly to individual this tax cut also help to build up the economy to make job in industry and to increase the production .of the many thing desire to improve the scale of live for the great majority of americans the strong expansion of the economy couple with a constant care for efficiency in government operation and an alert guard against waste and duplication have bring we to a prospective balance between income and expenditure this be be do while we continue to strengthen our military security i expect the budget to be in balance during the fiscal year end june 30 1956.i shall propose a balanced budget for the next fiscal year end june 30 1957.but the balance we be seek can not be accomplish without the continue every day effort of the executive and legislative branches to keep expenditure under control it will also be necessary to continue all of the present excise taxis without any reduction and the corporation income taxis at their present rate for another year beyond next april 1st it be unquestionably true that our present tax level be very burdensome and in the interest of long term and continuous economic growth should be reduce when we prudently can it be essential in the sound management of the government 's finance that we be mindful of our enormous national debt and of the obligation we have toward future americans to reduce that debt whenever we can appropriately do so under condition of high peacetime prosperity such as now exist we can never justify go far into debt to give ourselves a tax cut at the expense of our child so in the present state of our financial affair i earnestly believe that a tax cut can be deem justifiable only when it will not unbalance the budget a budget which make provision for some reduction even though modest in our national debt in this way we can well maintain fiscal integrity a fourth aim of our program be to foster a strong economyour competitive enterprise system depend on the energy of free human being limit by prudent restraint in law use free market to plan organize and distribute production and spur by the prospect of reward for successful effort this system have develop our resource it have marvelously expand our productive capacity against the record of all other economic system devise through the age this competitive system have prove the most creative user of human skill in the development of physical resource and the rich rewarder of human effort this be still true in this era when improve living standard and rise national requirement be accompany by swift advance in technology and rapid obsolescence in machine and method typical of these be the stride make in construction of plant to produce electrical energy from atomic power and of laboratory and installation for the application of this new force in industry agriculture and the heal art these development make it imperative to assure effective functioning of our enterprise system that the federal government concern itself with certain broad area of our economic life most important of these be agricultureour farm people be not share as they should in the general prosperity they alone of all major group have see their income decline rather than rise they be catch between two millstone rise production cost and decline price such harm to a part of the national economy so vitally important to everyone be of great concern to we all no other resource be so indispensable as the land that feed and clothe we no group be more fundamental to our national life than our farmer in successful prosecution of the war the nation call for the utmost effort of its farmer their response be superb their contribution unsurpasse farmer be not now to be blame for the mountainous price depress surplus produce in response to wartime policy and law that be too long continue war market be not the market of peacetime failure to recognize that basic fact by a timely adjustment of wartime legislation bring its inevitable result in peacetime surplus low price and low income for our farmer the dimension of government responsibility be as broad and complex as the farm problem itself we be here concerned not only with our essential continue supply of food and fiber but also with a way of life both be indispensable to the well being and strength of the nation consideration of these matter must be above and beyond politic our national farm policy so vital to the welfare of farm people and all of we must not become a field for political warfare too much be at stake our farm people expect of we who have responsibility for their government understanding of their problem and the will to help solve they our objective must be to help bring production into balance with exist and new market at price that yield farmer a return for their work in line with what other americans get to reach this goal deep seat problem must be subject to a step up attack there be no single easy solution rather there must be a many sided assault on the stubborn problem of surplus price cost and market and a steady persistent imaginative advance in the relationship between farmer and their government in a few day by special message i shall lay before the congress my detailed recommendation for new step that should be take promptly to speed the transition in agriculture and thus assist our farmer to achieve their fair share of the national income basic to this program will be a new attack on the surplus problem for even the well conceive farm program can not work under a multi billion dollar weight of accumulate stock i shall urge authorization of a soil bank program to alleviate the problem of divert acre and an overexpande agricultural plant this will include an acreage reserve to reduce current and accumulated surplus of crop in most serious difficulty and a conservation reserve to achieve other need adjustment in the use of agricultural resource i shall urge measure to strengthen our surplus disposal activity i shall propose measure to strengthen individual commodity program to remove control where possible to reduce carryover and to stop further accumulation of surplus i shall ask the congress to provide substantial new fund for an expand drive on the research front to develop new market new crop and new use the rural development program to better the lot of low income farm family deserve full congressional support the great plains program must go forward vigorously advance on these and other front will pull down the pricedepressing surplus and raise farm income in this time of testing in agriculture we should all together regardless of party carry forward resolutely with a sound and forward look program on which farm people may confidently depend now and for year to come i shall briefly mention four other subject directly relate to the well being of the economy preliminary to their full discussion in the economic report and later communication resource conservationi wish to re emphasize the critical importance of the wise use and conservation of our great natural resource of land forest mineral and water and their long range development consistent with our agricultural policy water in particular now play an increase role in industrial process in the irrigation of land in electric power as well as in domestic use at the same time it have the potential of damage and disaster a comprehensive legislative program for water conservation will be submit to the congress during the session the development of our water resource can not be accomplish overnight the need be such that we must make fast progress and without delay therefore i strongly recommend that action be take at this session on such wholly federal project as the colorado river storage project and the fryingpan arkansas project on the john day partnership project and other project which provide for

states and locality with the least financial resource federal aid should in no way jeopardize the freedom of local school system there will be present to the congress a recommend program of federal assistance for school construction such a program should be accompany by action to increase service to the nation 's school by the office of education and by legislation to provide continuation of

have make dramatic progress in conquering disease progress of profound human significance which can be greatly accelerate by an intensified effort in medical research a well support well balance program of research include basic research can open new frontier of knowledge prevent and relieve suffering and prolong life accordingly i shall recommend a substantial increase in federal fund for the support of such a program as an integral part of this effort i shall recommend a new plan to aid construction of non federal medical research and teaching facility and to help provide more adequate support for the training of medical research manpower finally we must aid in cushion the heavy and rise cost of illness and hospitalization to individual and family provision should be make by federal reinsurance or otherwise to foster extension of voluntary health insurance coverage to many more person especially old person and those in rural area plan should be evolve to improve

also the public welfare the need amendment should be enact without further delay we must also carry forward the job of improve the wagehour law last year i request the congress to broaden the coverage

earnestly urge the congress to move swiftly to implement these need labor measure in the field of human need we must carry forward the housing program which be contribute so greatly to the well being of our people and the prosperity of our economy home ownership be now advanced to the point where almost three of every five family in our city town and suburb own the house they live in for the housing program most of the legislative authority already exist however a firm program of public housing be essential until the private building industry have find way to provide more adequate housing for low income family the administration will propose authority to contract for 35 thousand additional public housing unit in each of the next 2 fiscal year for community which will participate in an integrate attack on slum and blight to meet the need of the grow number of old people several amendment to the national housing act will be propose to assist the private homebuilding industry as well as charitable and non profit organization with so large a number of the american people desire to modernize and improve exist dwelling i recommend that the title 1 program for permanent improvement in

in the special assistance authority of the federal national mortgage association and continue support of the college housing program in a way that will not discourage private capital from help to meet

field include a contributory life insurance program equitable pay increase and a fringe benefit program cover many need personnel policy change from improved premium pay to a meaningful incentive award program additional personnel management legislation be need in this session as i state last year an executive pay increase be essential to efficient governmental management such an increase together with need adjustment in the pay for the top career position be also necessary to the equitable completion of the federal pay program initiate last year other legislation will be propose include legislation for prepay group health insurance for employee and their dependent and to effect major improvement in the civil service retirement system all of we share a continue concern for those who have serve this nation in the armed forces the commission on veterans pensions be at this time conduct a study of the entire field of veteran benefit and will soon submit propose improvement we be proud of the progress our people have make in the field of civil right in executive branch operation throughout the nation elimination of discrimination and segregation be all but complete progress be also be make among contractor engage in furnish government service and requirement every citizen now have the opportunity to fit himself for and to hold a position of responsibility in the service of his country in the district of columbia through the voluntary cooperation of the people discrimination and segregation be disappear from hotel theater restaurant and other facility it be disturb that in some locality allegation persist that negro citizen be be deprive of their right to vote and be likewise be subject to unwarranted economic pressure i recommend that the substance of these charge be thoroughly examine by a bipartisan commission create by the congress it be hope that such a commission will be establish promptly so that it may arrive at finding which can receive early consideration the stature of our leadership in the free world have increase through the past three year because we have make more progress than ever before in a similar period to assure our citizen equality in justice in opportunity and in civil right we must expand this effort on every front we must strive to have every person judge and measure by what he be rather than by his color race or religion there will soon be recommend to the congress a program far to advance the effort of the government within the area of federal responsibility to accomplish these objective one particular challenge confront we in the hawaiian islands east meet west to the islands asia and europe and the western hemisphere all the continent have contribute their people and their culture to display a unique example of a community that be a successful laboratory in human brotherhood statehood support by the repeatedly express desire of the islands people and by our tradition would be a shine example of the american way to the entire earth consequently i urgently request this congress to grant statehood for hawaii also in harmony with the provision i last year communicate to the senate and house committees on interior and insular affairs i trust that progress toward statehood for alaska can be make in this session progress be constant toward full integration of our indian citizen into normal community life during the past two year the administration have provide school facility for thousand of indian child previously deny this opportunity we must continue to meet the need of increase number of indian child provision should also be make for the education of adult indians whose schooling in early year be neglect in keep with our responsibility of world leadership and in our own self interest i again point out to the congress the urgent need for revision of the immigration and nationality law our nation have always welcome immigrant to our shore the wisdom of such a policy be clearly show by the fact that america have be build by immigrant and the descendant of immigrant that policy must be continue realistically with present day condition in mind i recommend that the number of person admit to this country annually be base not on the 1920 census but on the late the 1950 census provision should be make to allow for great flexibility in the use of quota so if one country do not use its share the vacancy may be make available for the use of qualified individual from other country the law should be amend to permit the secretary of state and the attorney general to waive the requirement of fingerprinting on a reciprocal basis for person come to this country for temporary visit this and other change in the law be long overdue and should be take care of promptly detailed recommendation for revision of the immigration law will be submit to the congress i be happy to report substantial progress in the flow of immigrant under the refugee relief act of 1953 however i again request this congress to approve without far delay the urgently need amendment to that act which i submit in the last session because of the high prosperity in germany and austria the number of immigrant from those country will be reduce this will make available thousand of unfilled opening which i recommend be distribute to greece and italy and to escapee from behind the iron curtain once again i ask the congress to join with i in demonstrate our belief in the right of suffrage i renew my request that the principle of self government be extend and the right of suffrage grant to the citizen of the district of columbia to conclude the vista before we be bright the march of science the expand economy the advance in collective security toward a just peace in this threefold movement our people be create new standard by which the future of the republic may be judge progress however will be realize only as it be more than match by a continue growth in the spiritual strength of the nation our dedication to moral value must be complete in our dealing abroad and in our relationship among ourselves we have single minded devotion to the common good of america never must we forget that this mean the well being the prosperity the security of all americans in every walk of life to the attainment of these objective i pledge full energy of the administration as in the session ahead it work on a program for submission to you the congress of the united states
chairman martin delegates and alternates to this great convention distinguished guest and my fellow americans wherever they may be in this broad land
 i should first tell you that i have no word in which to express the gratitude that mrs. eisenhower and i feel for the warmth of your welcome the cordiality you have extend to we and to the member of our family our son and daughter my brother and their wife touch our heart deeply
 thank you very much indeed
 i thank you additionally and personally for the high honor you have accord i in entrust i once more with your nomination for the presidency and i should like to say that it be a great satisfaction to i that the team of individual you select in 1952 you have select to keep intact for this campaign
 i be not here go to attempt a eulogy of mr. nixon you have hear his qualification describe in the past several day i merely want to say this that whatever dedication to country loyalty and patriotism and great ability can do for america he will do and that i know
 lady and gentleman when abraham lincoln be nominate in 1860 and a committee bring the news to he at his home in springfield illinois his reply be two sentence long then while his friend and neighbor wait in the street and while bonfire light up the may evening he say simply and now i will not long defer the pleasure of take you and each of you by the hand
 i wish i could do the same speak two sentence and then take each one of you by the hand all of you who be in sound of my voice if i could do so i would first thank you individually for your confidence and your trust then as i be sure lincoln do as he move among his friend in the light of the bonfire we could pause and talk a while about the question that be uppermost in your mind
 i be sure that one topic would dominate all the rest that topic be the future
 this be a good time to think about the future for this convention be celebrate its one hundredth anniversary and a centennial be an occasion not just for recall the inspire past but even more for look ahead to the demand future
 just as on new year 's day we instinctively think i wonder where i will be a year from now so it be quite natural for the republican party to ask today what will happen not just in the come election but even one hundred year from now
 my answer be this if we and our successor be as courageous and forward look and as militantly determine here under the klieg light of the twentieth century as abraham lincoln and his associate be in the bonfire light of the nineteenth the republican party will continue to grow in the confidence and affection of the american people not only to november next but indeed to and beyond its second centennial
 now of course in this convention set you and i be momentarily more interested in november 1956 than in 2056 but the point be this our policy be right today only as they be design to stand the test of tomorrow
 the great norwegian henrik ibsen once write i hold that man be in the right who be most clearly in league with the future
 today i want to demonstrate the truth of a single proposition the republican party be the party of the future
 i hold that the republican party and platform be right in 1956 because they be most closely in league with the future and for this reason the republican party and program be and will be decisively approve by the american people in 1956
 my friend i have just make a very fiat statement for victory for the republican party in november and i believe it from the bottom of my heart
 but what i say be base upon certain assumption and those assumption must become true if the prediction i make be to be valid and that be this that every american who believe as we do the republicans the independent the straight think democrats must carry the message of the record and the pledge that we here make that we have make and here make to all the people of the land
 we must see as we do our civic duty that not only do we vote but that everybody be qualified to vote that everybody register and everybody go to the poll in november here be a task not only for the republican national committee for the woman 's organization for the citizen organization for the so call youth for eisenhower everybody that bear this message in his heart must carry it to the country
 in that way we will win
 and which remind i my friend there be only a few day leave for register in a number of our states that be one thing you can not defer the record show that our registration as compare to former year at this time be way down across the land registration across the board let us help the american heritage let us help the boy scouts let us help everybody to get people out to register to vote
 now of special relevance and to i particularly gratifying be the fact that the country 's young people show a consistent preference for this administration after all let we not forget these young people be america 's future parenthetically may i say i shall never cease to hope that the several state will give they the voting privilege at a somewhat early age than be now generally the case
 now the first reason of the five i shall give you why the republican party be the party of the future be this
 first because it be the party of long range principle not short term expediency
 one of my predecessor be say to have observe that in make his decision he have to operate like a football quarterback he could not very well call the next play until he see how the last play turn out well that may be a good way to run a football team but in these day it be no way to run a government
 now why be it so important that great governmental program be base upon principle rather than upon shift political opportunism
 it be because what government do affect profoundly the daily life and plan of every person in the country if governmental action be without the solid guideline of endure principle national policy flounder in confusion and more than this the million of individual family and enterprise whose risk taking and planning for the future be our country 's very life force be paralyze by uncertainty diffidence and indecision
 change base on principle be progress constant change without principle become chaos
 i shall give you several example of reject expediency in favor of principle
 first the farm issue
 expediency say let us do something in a hurry anything even multiply our price depress surplus at the risk of make the
 problem twice as bad next year just so we get through this year
 people who talk like that do not care about principle and do not know farmer the farmer deal every day in basic principle of growth and life his product must be plan and cultivate and harvest over a long period he have to figure not just a year at a time but over cycle and span of year as to his soil his water his equipment the strain of his stock and the strain on his income
 and so for this man of principle we have design our program of principle in it we recognize that we have receive from our forebear a rich legacy our continent 's basic resource of soil we be determined that through such measure as the soil bank and the great plains program this legacy shall be hand on to our child even rich than we receive it
 we be equally determined that farm price and income which be needlessly push down under surplus surplus induce first by war and then by unwise political action that be stubbornly and recklessly prolong shall in the come month and year get back on a genuinely healthy basis this improvement must continue until a rightful share of our prosperity be permanently enjoy by agriculture on which our very life depend
 a second example labor relation
 expediency say when a major labor dispute loom the government must do something anything to settle the dispute even before the party have finish negotiate get an injunction seize the steel mill appoint a board knock their head together
 principle say free collective bargaining without government interference be the cornerstone of the american philosophy of labor management relation
 if the government charge impatiently into every major dispute the negotiation between party will become a pointless preliminary farce while everyone wait around to see what the government will do this administration have faith in the rightness of the collective bargaining principle it believe in the maturity of both labor and business leader and in their determination to do what be good not only for their own side but for the country as a whole
 the result for the first time in our history a complete steel contract be negotiate and sign without direct government intervention and the last three and a half year have witness one of the most remarkable period of labor peace on record
 another example concentration of power in washington expediency say
 we can not allow our fine new idea to be at the mercy of 51 separate state and territorial legislature it be so much quick and easy to plan finance and direct all major project from washington
 principle say geographical balance of power be essential to our form of free society if you take the centralization shortcut every time something be to be do you will perhaps sometimes get quick action but there be no perhaps about the price you will pay for your impatience the growth of a swollen bureaucratic monster government in washington in whose shadow our state and local government will ultimately wither and die
 and so we stem the heedless stampede to washington we make a special point of build up state activity state finance and state prestige
 our founding fathers show we how the federal government could exercise its undoubted responsibility for leadership while still stop short of the kind of interference that deaden local vigor variety initiative and imagination so today we say to our young people the party of the future will pass along to you undamage the unique system of division of authority which have prove so successful in reconcile our old ideal of personal freedom with the twentieth century need for decisiveness in action
 my second reason for say that the republican party be the party of the future be this it be the party which concentrate on the fact and issue of today and tomorrow not the fact and issue of yesterday
 more than twenty year ago our opponent find in the problem of the depression a battleground on which they score many political victory now economic cycle have not be eliminate still the world have move on from the 1930 's good time have supplant depression new technique for check serious recession have be learn and test and a whole new array of problem have spring up but their obsession with a depression still blind many of our opponent to the insistent demand of today
 the present and the future be bring new kind of challenge to federal and local government water supply highway health housing power development and peaceful use of atomic energy with two third of we live in big city question of urban organization and redevelopment must be give high priority high of all perhaps will be the priority of first class education to meet the demand of our swiftly grow school age population
 the party of the young and of all age say let we quit fight the battle of the past and let we all turn our attention to these problem of the present and future on which the longterm well being of our people so urgently depend
 third the republican party be the party of the future because it be the party that draw people together not drive they apart
 our party detest the technique of pit group against group for cheap political advantage republican view as a central principle of conduct not just as a phrase on nickel and dime that old motto of our e pluribus unum"—"out of many one




 our party as far back as 1856 begin establish a record of bring together as its large element the work people and small farmer as well as the small businessman it attract minority group scholar and writer not to mention reformer of all kind free soilers independent democrats conscience whigs barnburners soft hunker teetotaller vegetarian and transcendentalist
 now a hundred year later the republican party be again the rallying point for americans of all calling age race and income they see in its broad forward move straight down the road fight program the good promise for their own steady progress toward a bright future some opponent have try to call this a one interest party indeed it be a one interest party and that one interest be the interest of every man woman and child in america and most surely as long as the republican party continue to be this kind of one interest party a one universal interest party it will continue to be the party of the future
 and now the fourth reason the republican party be the party of the future because it be the party through which the many thing that still need do will soon be do and will be do by enlist the full energy of free creative individual people
 republicans have prove that it be possible for a government to have a warm sensitive concern for the everyday need of people while steer clear of the paternalistic big brother be watch you kind of interference the individual and especially the idealistic young person have no faith in a tight federal monopoly on problem solving he seek and deserve opportunity for himself and every other person who be burn to participate in put right the wrong of the world
 in our time of prosperity and progress one thing we must always be on guard against be smugness true thing be go well but there be thousand of thing still to be do there be still enough needless suffering to be cure enough injustice to be erase to provide career for all the crusader we can produce or find
 we want they all republicans independent discern democrat come on in and help
 one hundred year ago the republican party be create in a devout belief in equal justice and equal opportunity for all in a nation of free man and woman
 what be more the republican party 's record on social justice rest not on word and promise but on accomplishment the record show that a wide range of quietly effective action conceive in understanding and good will for all have bring about more genuine and often voluntary progress toward equal justice and opportunity in the last three year than be accomplish in all the previous twenty put together elimination of various kind of discrimination in the armed services the district of columbia and among the employee of government contractor provide specific example of this progress
 in this work incidentally no one have be more effective and more energetic than our vice president who have head one of the great committees in this direction
 now in all exist kind of discrimination there be much to do we must insure a fair chance to such people as mature worker who have trouble get job old citizen with problem of health housing security and recreation migratory farm laborer and physically handicapped worker we have with we also problem involve american indians low income farmer and laborer woman who sometimes do not get equal pay for equal work small businessman and employer and worker in area which need special assistance for redevelopment
 specific new program of action be be push for all of these the most recent be a new 14 point program for small businessman which be announce early in august and the everyday well being of people be be advanced on many other front this be be do not by paternalistic regimentation it be do by clear cut aggressive federal leadership and by release the illimitable resource and drive of our million of self reliant individual and our thousand of private organization of every conceivable kind and size each of these be consecrate to the task of meet some human need cure some human evil or enrich some human experience
 finally a party of the future must be completely dedicated to peace as indeed must all americans for without peace there be no future
 it be in the light of this truth that the united states propose its atoms for peace plan in 1953 and since then have do so much to make this new science universally available to friendly nation in order to promote human welfare we have agreement with more than thirty nation for research reactor and with seven for power reactor while many other be under consideration twenty thousand kilogram of nuclear fuel have be set aside for the foreign program
 in the same way we have work unceasingly for the promotion of effective step in disarmament so that the labor of man could with confidence be devoted to their own improvement rather than waste in the building of engine of destruction
 no one be more aware than i that it be the young who fight the war and it be the young who give up year of their life to military training and service it be not enough that their elder promise peace in our time it must be peace in their time too and in their child 's time indeed my friend there be only one real peace now and that be peace for all time
 now there be three imperative of peace three requirement that the prudent man must face with unblinking realism
 the first imperative be the elementary necessity of maintain our own national strength moral economic and military
 it be still my conviction as i write in 1947 the compelling necessity of the moment leave we no alternative to the maintenance of real and respectable strength not only in our moral rectitude and our economic power but in term of adequate military preparedness
 during the past three and one half year our military strength have be constantly augment soberly and intelligently our country have never before in peacetime be so well prepared militarily so long as the world situation require our security must be vigorously sustain
 our economic power as everyone know be display a capacity for growth which be both rapid and sound even while support record military budget we must keep it grow
 but moral strength be also essential today we be compete for man 's heart and mind and trust all over the world in such a competition what we be at home and what we do at home be even more important than what we say abroad here again my friend we find constructive work for each of we
 what each of we do how each of we act have an influence on this question
 now the second imperative of peace be collective security
 we live in a shrunken world a world in which ocean be cross in hour a world in which a single minded despotism menace the scatter freedom of score of struggle independent nation to ensure the combined strength of friendly nation be for all of we an elementary matter of self preservation as elementary as have a stout militia in the day of the
 flint lock
 again the strength i speak of be not military strength alone the heart of the collective security principle be the idea of help other nation to realize their own potentiality political economic and military the strength of the free world lie not in cement the free world into a second monolithic mass to compete with that of the communist it lie rather in the unity that come of the voluntary association of nation which however diverse be develop their own capacity and assert their own national destiny in a world of freedom and of mutual respect
 there can be no endure peace for any nation while other nation suffer privation oppression and a sense of injustice and despair in our modern world it be madness to suppose that there could be an island of tranquillity and prosperity in a sea of wretchedness and frustration for america 's sake as well as the world 's we must measure up to the challenge of the second imperative the urgent need for mutual economic and military cooperation among the free nation sufficient to deter or repel aggression wherever it may threaten
 but even this be no long enough
 we be in the era of the thermo nuclear bomb that can obliterate city and can be deliver across continent with such weapon war have become not just tragic but preposterous with such weapon there can be no victory for anyone plainly the objective now must be to see that such a war do not occur at all
 and so the third imperative of peace be this without for a moment relax our internal and collective defense we must actively try to bridge the great chasm that separate we from the people under communist rule in those region be million of individual human being who have be our friend and who themselves have sincerely want peace and freedom throughout so much of our mutual history
 now for year the iron curtain be impenetrable our people be unable to talk to these individual behind the curtain or travel among they or share their art or sport or invite they to see what life be like in a free democracy or even get acquaint in any way what future be there in such a course except great misunderstanding and an ever deepening division in the world
 of course good will from our side can do little to reach these people unless there be some new spirit of conciliation on the part of the government control they now at last there appear to be sign that some small degree of friendly intercourse among people may be permit we be begin to be able cautiously and with our eye open to encourage some interchange of idea of book magazine student tourist artist radio program technical expert religious leader and governmental official the hope be that little by little mistrust base on falsehood will give way to international understanding base on truth
 now as this development gradually come about it will not seem futile for young people to dream of a brave and new and shine world or for old people to feel that they can in fact bequeath to their child a well inheritance than that which be their own science and technology labor save method management labor organization education medicine and not least politic and government all these have bring within our grasp a world in which backbreake toil and long hour will not be necessary
 travel all over the world to learn to know our brother abroad will be fast and cheap the fear and pain of crippling disease will be greatly reduce the material thing that make life interesting and pleasant will be available to everyone leisure together with educational and recreational facility will be abundant so that all can develop the life of the spirit of reflection of religion of the art of the full realization of the good thing of the world and political wisdom will ensure justice and harmony
 this picture of the future bring to mind a little story
 a government worker when he first arrive in washington in 1953 be pass the national archives building in a taxi where he see this motto carve on one of its pedestal what be past be prologue he have hear that washington cab driver be note for know all the washington answer so he ask the driver about the motto oh that say the driver that be just bureaucrat talk what it really mean is—'you be not see nothing yet
 my friend the kind of era i have describe be possible but it will not be attain by revolution it will not be attain by the sordid politic of pit group against group it will be bring about by the ambition and judgment and inspiration and daring of 168 million free americans work together and with friend abroad toward a common ideal in a peaceful world
 lincoln speak to the republican state convention in 1858 begin with the biblical quotation a house divide against itself can not stand
 today the world be a house divide
 but as be sometimes forget lincoln follow this quotation with a note of hope for his troubled country i do not expect the house to fall he say but i do expect it will cease to be divide
 a century later we too must have the vision the fight spirit and the deep religious faith in our creator 's destiny for we to sound a similar note of promise for our divided world that out of our time there can with incessant work and with god 's help emerge a new era of good life good will and good hope for all man
 one american put it this way every tomorrow have two handle we can take hold of it with the handle of anxiety or the handle of faith
 my friend in firm faith and in the conviction that the republican purpose and principle be in league with this kind of future the nomination that you have tender i for the presidency of the united states i now humbly but confidently accept

first may i express to you my deep appreciation of your courtesy in give i at some inconvenience to yourself this early opportunity of address you on a matter i deem to be of grave importance to our country
 in my forthcoming state of the union message i shall review the international situation generally there be worldwide hope which we can reasonably entertain and there be worldwide responsibility which we must carry to make certain that freedom include our own may be secure
 there be however a special situation in the middle east which i feel i should even now lie before you
 before do so it be well to remind ourselves that our basic national objective in international affair remain peace a world peace base on justice such a peace must include all area all people of the world if it be to be endure there be no nation great or small with which we would refuse to negotiate in mutual good faith with patience and in the determination to secure a well understanding between we out of such understanding must and eventually will grow confidence and trust indispensable ingredient to a program of peace and to plan for lift from we all the burden of expensive armament to promote these objective our government work tirelessly day by day month by month year by year but until a degree of success crown our effort that will assure to all nation peaceful existence we must in the interest of peace itself remain vigilant alert and strong

 the middle east have abruptly reach a new and critical stage in its long and important history in past decade many of the country in that area be not fully self governing other nation exercise considerable authority in the area and the security of the region be largely build around their power but since the first world war there have be a steady evolution toward self government and independence this development the united states have welcome and have encourage our country support without reservation the full sovereignty and independence of each and every nation of the middle east
 the evolution to independence have in the main be a peaceful process but the area have be often trouble persistent crosscurrent of distrust and fear with raid back and forth across national boundary have bring about a high degree of instability in much of the mid east just recently there have be hostility involve western european nation that once exercise much influence in the area also the relatively large attack by israel in october have intensify the basic difference between that nation and its arab neighbor all this instability have be heighten and at time manipulate by international communism
 ii
 russia 's ruler have long seek to dominate the middle east that be true of the czars and it be true of the bolsheviks the reason be not hard to find they do not affect russia 's security for no one plan to use the middle east as a base for aggression against russia never for a moment have the united states entertain such a thought
 the soviet union have nothing whatsoever to fear from the united states in the middle east or anywhere else in the world so long as its ruler do not themselves first resort to aggression
 that statement i make solemnly and emphatically
 neither do russia 's desire to dominate the middle east spring from its own economic interest in the area russia do not appreciably use or depend upon the suez canal in 1955 soviet traffic through the canal represent only about three fourth of 1 percent of the total the soviets have no need for and could provide no market for the petroleum resource which constitute the principal natural wealth of the area indeed the soviet union be a substantial exporter of petroleum product
 the reason for russia 's interest in the middle east be solely that of power politic consider her announce purpose of communize the world it be easy to understand her hope of dominate the middle east
 this region have always be the crossroad of the continent of the eastern hemisphere the suez canal enable the nation of asia and europe to carry on the commerce that be essential if these country be to maintain well rounded and prosperous economy the middle east provide a gateway between eurasia and africa
 it contain about two third of the presently know oil deposit of the world and it normally supply the petroleum need of many nation of europe asia and africa the nation of europe be peculiarly dependent upon this supply and this dependency relate to transportation as well as to production this have be vividly demonstrate since the closing of the suez canal and some of the pipeline alternate way of transportation and indeed alternate source of power can if necessary be develop but these can not be consider as early prospect
 these thing stress the immense importance of the middle east if the nation of that area should lose their independence if they be dominate by alien force hostile to freedom that would be both a tragedy for the area and for many other free nation whose economic life would be subject to near strangulation western europe would be endanger just as though there have be no marshall plan no north atlantic treaty organization the free nation of asia and africa too would be place in serious jeopardy and the country of the middle east would lose the market upon which their economy depend all this would have the most adverse if not disastrous effect upon our own nation 's economic life and political prospect
 then there be other factor which transcend the material the middle east be the birthplace of three great religion moslem christian and hebrew mecca and jerusalem be more than place on the map they symbolize religion which teach that the spirit have supremacy over matter and that the individual have a dignity and right of which no despotic government can rightfully deprive he it would be intolerable if the holy place of the middle east should be subject to a rule that glorify atheistic materialism
 international communism of course seek to mask its purpose of domination by expression of good will and by superficially attractive offer of political economic and military aid but any free nation which be the subject of soviet enticement ought in elementary wisdom to look behind the
 mask
 remember estonia latvia and lithuania in 1939 the soviet union enter into mutual assistance pact with these then dependent country and the soviet foreign minister address the extraordinary fifth session of the supreme soviet in october 1939 solemnly and publicly declare that we stand for the scrupulous and punctilious observance of the pact on the basis of complete reciprocity and we declare that all the nonsensical talk about the sovietization of the baltic country be only to the interest of our common enemy and of all anti soviet provocateur yet in 1940 estonia latvia and lithuania be forcibly incorporate into the soviet union
 soviet control of the satellite nation of eastern europe have be forcibly maintain in spite of solemn promise of a contrary intent make during world war ii
 stalin 's death bring hope that this pattern would change and we read the pledge of the warsaw treaty of 1955 that the soviet union would follow in satellite country the principle of mutual respect for their independence and sovereignty and noninterference in domestic affair but we have just see the subjugation of hungary by naked armed force in the aftermath of this hungarian tragedy world respect for and belief in soviet promise have sink to a new low international communism need and seek a recognizable success
 thus we have these simple and indisputable fact
 1 the middle east which have always be covet by russia would today be prize more than ever by international communism
 2 the soviet ruler continue to show that they do not scruple to use any mean to gain their end
 3 the free nation of the mid east need and for the most part want add strength to assure their continued independence
 iii
 our thought naturally turn to the united nations as a protector of small nation its charter give it primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security our country have give the united nations its full support in relation to the hostility in hungary and in egypt the united nations be able to bring about a cease fire and withdrawal of hostile force from egypt because it be deal with government and people who have a decent respect for the opinion of mankind as reflect in the united nations general assembly but in the case of hungary the situation be different the soviet union veto action by the security council to require the withdrawal of soviet armed force from hungary and it have show callous indifference to the recommendation even the censure of the general assembly the united nations can always be helpful but it can not be a wholly dependable protector of freedom when the ambition of the soviet union be involve
 iv
 under all the circumstance i have lay before you a great responsibility now devolve upon the united states we have show so that none can doubt our dedication to the principle that force shall not be use internationally for any aggressive purpose and that the integrity and independence of the nation of the middle east should be inviolate seldom in history have a nation 's dedication to principle be test as severely as ours during recent week
 there be general recognition in the middle east as elsewhere that the united states do not seek either political or economic domination over any other people our desire be a world environment of freedom not servitude on the other hand many if not all of the nation of the middle east be aware of the danger that stem from international communism and welcome close cooperation with the united states to realize for themselves the united nations goal of independence economic well being and spiritual growth
 if the middle east be to continue its geographic role of unite rather than separate east and west if its vast economic resource be to serve the well being of the people there as well as that of other and if its culture and religion and their shrine be to be preserve for the uplifting of the spirit of the people then the united states must make more evident its willingness to support the independence of the freedom love nation of the area
 v.
 under these circumstance i deem it necessary to seek the cooperation of the congress only with that cooperation can we give the reassurance need to deter aggression to give courage and confidence to those who be dedicate to freedom and thus prevent a chain of event which would gravely endanger all of the free world
 there have be several executive declaration make by the united states in relation to the middle east there be the tripartite declaration of may 25 1950 follow by the presidential assurance of october 31 1950 to the king of saudi arabia there be the presidential declaration of april 9 1956 that
 the united states will within constitutional mean oppose any aggression in the area there be our declaration of november 29 1956 that a threat to the territorial integrity or political independence of iran iraq pakistan or turkey would be view by the united states with the utmost gravity
 nevertheless weakness in the present situation and the increase danger from international communism convince i that basic united states policy should now find expression in joint action by the congress and the executive furthermore our joint resolve should be so couch as to make it apparent that if need be our word will be back by action
 vi
 it be nothing new for the president and the congress to join to recognize that the national integrity of other free nation be directly relate to our own security
 we have join to create and support the security system of the united nations we have reinforce the collective security system of the united nations by a series of collective defense arrangement today we have security treaty with 42 other nation which recognize that our peace and security be intertwine we have join to take decisive action in relation to greece and turkey and in relation to taiwan
 thus the united states through the joint action of the president and the congress or in the case of treaty the senate have manifest in many endanger area its purpose to support free and independent government and peace against external menace notably the menace of international communism thereby we have help to maintain peace and security during a period of great danger it be now essential that the united states should manifest through joint action of the president and the congress our determination to assist those nation of the mid east area which desire that assistance
 the action which i propose would have the following feature
 it would first of all authorize the united states to cooperate with and assist any nation or group of nation in the general area of the middle east in the development of economic strength dedicate to the maintenance of national independence
 it would in the second place authorize the executive to undertake in the same region program of military assistance and cooperation with any nation or group of nation which desire such aid
 it would in the third place authorize such assistance and cooperation to include the employment of the armed force of the united states to secure and protect the territorial integrity and political independence of such nation request such aid against overt armed aggression from any nation control by international communism
 these measure would have to be consonant with the treaty obligation of the united states include the charter of the united nations and with any action or recommendation of the united nations they would also if armed attack occur be subject to the override authority of the united nations security council in accordance with the charter
 the present proposal would in the fourth place authorize the president to employ for economic and defensive military purpose sum available under the mutual security act of 1954 as amend without regard to exist limitation
 the legislation now request should not include the authorization or appropriation of fund because i believe that under the condition i suggest presently appropriate fund will be adequate for the balance of the present fiscal year end june 30 i shall however seek in subsequent legislation the authorization of $ 200,000,000 to be available during each of the fiscal year 1958 and 1959 for discretionary use in the area in addition to the other mutual security program for the area hereafter provide for by the congress
 vii
 this program will not solve all the problem of the middle east neither do it represent the totality of our policy for the area there be the problem of palestine and relation between israel and the arab states and the future of the arab refugee there be the problem of the future status of the suez canal these difficulty be aggravate by international communism but they would exist quite apart from that threat it be not the purpose of the legislation i propose to deal directly with these problem the united nations be actively concern itself with all these matter and we be support the united nations the united states have make clear notably by secretary dulles address of august 26 1955 that we be willing to do much to assist the united nations in solve the basic problem of palestine
 the propose legislation be primarily design to deal with the possibility of communist aggression direct and indirect there be imperative need that any lack of power in the area should be make good not by external or alien force but by the increase vigor and security of the independent nation of the area
 experience show that indirect aggression rarely if ever succeed where there be reasonable security against direct aggression where the government dispose of loyal security force and where economic condition be such as not to make communism seem an attractive alternative the program i suggest deal with all three aspect of this matter and thus with the problem of indirect aggression
 it be my hope and belief that if our purpose be proclaim as propose by the request legislation that very fact will serve to halt any contemplated aggression we shall have hearten the patriot who be dedicate to the independence of their nation they will not feel that they stand alone under the menace of great power and i should add that patriotism be throughout this area a powerful sentiment it be true that fear sometimes pervert true patriotism into fanaticism and to the acceptance of dangerous enticement from without but if that fear can be allay then the climate will be more favorable to the attainment of worthy national ambition
 and as i have indicate it will also be necessary for we to contribute economically to strengthen those country or group of country which have government manifestly dedicate to the preservation of independence and resistance to subversion such measure will provide the great insurance against communist inroad word alone be not enough
 viii
 let i refer again to the request authority to employ the armed force of the united states to assist to defend the territorial integrity and the political independence of any nation in the area against communist armed aggression such authority would not be exercise except at the desire of the nation attack beyond this it be my profound hope that this authority would never have to be exercise at all
 nothing be more necessary to assure this than that our policy with respect to the defense of the area be promptly and clearly determine and declare thus the united nations and all friendly government and indeed government which be not friendly will know where we stand
 if contrary to my hope and expectation a situation arise which call for the military application of the policy which i ask the congress to join i in proclaim i would of course maintain hour by hour contact with the congress if it be in session and if the congress be not in session and if the situation have grave implication i would of course at once call the congress into special session
 in the situation now exist the great risk as be often the case be that ambitious despot may miscalculate if power hungry communists should either falsely or correctly estimate that the middle east be inadequately defend they might be tempt to use open measure of armed attack if so that would start a chain of circumstance which would almost surely involve the united states in military action i be convinced that the good insurance against this dangerous contingency be to make clear now our readiness to cooperate fully and freely with our friend of the middle east in way consonant with the purpose and principle of the united nations i intend promptly to send a special mission to the middle east to explain the cooperation we be prepared to give
 ix
 the policy which i outline involve certain burden and indeed risk for the united states those who covet the area will not like what be propose already they be grossly distort our purpose however before this americans have see our nation 's vital interest and human freedom in jeopardy and their fortitude and resolution have be equal to the crisis regardless of hostile distortion of our word motive and action
 indeed the sacrifice of the american people in the cause of freedom have even since the close of world war ii be measure in many billion of dollar and in thousand of the precious life of our youth these sacrifice by which great area of the world have be preserve to freedom must not be throw away
 in those momentous period of the past the president and the congress have unite without partisanship to serve the vital interest of the united states and of the free world
 the occasion have come for we to manifest again our national unity in support of freedom and to show our deep respect for the right and independence of every nation however great however small we seek not violence but peace to this purpose we must now devote our energy our determination ourselves

i appear before the congress today to report on the state of the union and the relationship of the union to the other nation of the world i come here firmly convinced that at no time in the history of the republic have circumstance more emphatically underscore the need in all echelon of government for vision and wisdom and resolution you meet in a season of stress that be test the fitness of political system and the validity of political philosophy each stress stem in part from cause peculiar to itself but every stress be a reflection of a universal phenomenon in the world today the surge and understandable tide of nationalism be mark by widespread revulsion and revolt against tyranny injustice inequality and poverty as individual join in a common hunger for freedom man and woman and even child pit their spirit against gun and tank on a large scale in an ever more persistent search for the self respect of authentic sovereignty and the economic base on which national independence must rest people sever old tie seek new alliance experiment sometimes dangerously in their struggle to satisfy these human aspiration particularly in the past year this tide have change the pattern of attitude and think among million the change already accomplish foreshadow a world transform by the spirit of freedom this be no faint and pious hope the force now at work in the mind and heart of man will not be spend through many year in the main today 's expression of nationalism be in spirit echo of our forefather struggle for independence this republic can not be aloof to these event herald a new epoch in the affair of mankind our pledge word our enlighten self interest our character as a nation commit we to a high role in world affair a role of vigorous leadership ready strength sympathetic understanding the state of the union at the opening of the 85th congress continue to vindicate the wisdom of the principle on which this republic be rounded proclaim in the constitution of the nation and in many of our historic document and round in devout religious conviction these principle enunciate a vigilant regard for human liberty a wise concern for human welfare a ceaseless effort for human progress fidelity to these principle in our relation with other people have win we new friendship and have increase our opportunity for service within the family of nation the appeal of these principle be universal light fire in the soul of man everywhere we shall continue to uphold they against those who deny they and in counselling with our friend at home the application of these principle to the complex problem of our national life have bring we to an unprecedented peak in our economic prosperity and have exemplify in our way of life the endure human value of mind and spirit through the past four year these principle have guide the legislative program submit by the administration to the congress as we attempt to apply they to current event domestic and foreign we must take into account the complex entity that be the united states of america what endanger it what can improve it the visible structure be our american economy itself after more than a century and a half of constant expansion it be still rich in a wide variety of natural resource it be first among nation in its people'. mastery of industrial skill it be productive beyond our own need of many foodstuff and industrial product it be rewarding to all our citizen in opportunity to earn and to advance in self realization and in self expression it be fortunate in its wealth of educational and cultural and religious center it be vigorously dynamic in the limitless initiative and willingness to venture that characterize free enterprise it be productive of a widely share prosperity our economy be strong expand and fundamentally sound but in any realistic appraisal even the optimistic analyst will realize that in a prosperous period the principal threat to efficient functioning of a free enterprise system be inflation we look back on four year of prosperous activity during which price the cost of living have be relatively stable that is inflation have be hold in check but it be clear that the danger be always present particularly if the government might become profligate in its expenditure or private group might ignore all the possible result on our economy of unwise struggle for immediate gain this danger require a firm resolution that the federal government shall utilize only a prudent share of the nation 's resource that it shall live within its mean carefully measure against need alternative proposal for expenditure through the next four year i shall continue to insist that the executive department and agency of government search out additional way to save money and manpower i urge that the congress be equally watchful in this matter we pledge the government 's share in guard the integrity of the dollar but the government 's effort can not be the entire campaign against inflation the thief that can rob the individual of the value of the pension and social security he have earn during his productive life for success government 's effort must be parallel by the attitude and action of individual citizen i have often speak of the purpose of this administration to serve the national interest of 170 million people the national interest must take precedence over temporary advantage which may be secure by particular group at the expense of all the people in this regard i call on leader in business and in labor to think well on their responsibility to the american people with all element of our society they owe the nation a vigilant guard against the inflationary tendency that be always at work in a dynamic economy operate at today 's high level they can powerfully help counteract or accentuate such tendency by their wage and price policy business in its pricing policy should avoid unnecessary price increase especially at a time like the present when demand in so many area press hard on short supply a reasonable profit be essential to the new investment that provide more job in an expand economy but business leader must in the national interest studiously avoid those price rise that be possible only because of vital or unusual need of the whole nation if our economy be to remain healthy increase in wage and other labor benefit negotiate by labor and management must be reasonably relate to improvement in productivity such increase be beneficial for they provide wage earner with great purchasing power except where necessary to correct obvious injustice wage increase that outrun productivity however be an inflationary factor they make for high price for the public generally and impose a particular hardship on those whose welfare depend on the purchase power of retirement income and saving wage negotiation should also take cognizance of the right of the public generally to share in the benefit of improvement in technology freedom have be define as the opportunity for self discipline this definition have a special application to the area of wage and price policy in a free economy should we persistently fail to discipline ourselves eventually there will be increase pressure on government to redress the failure by that process freedom will step by step disappear no subject on the domestic scene should more attract the concern of the friend of american work man and woman and of free business enterprise than the force that threaten a steady depreciation of the value of our money concern development in another vital sector of our economy agriculture i be gratified that the long slide in farm income have be halt and that further improvement be in prospect this be hearten progress three tool that we have develop improve surplus disposal improve price support law and the soil bank be work to reduce price depress government stock of farm product our concern for the well being of farm family demand that we constantly search for new way by which they can share more fully in our unprecedented prosperity legislative recommendation in the field of agriculture be contain in the budget message our soil water mineral forest fish and wildlife resource be be conserve and improve more effectively their conservation and development be vital to the present and future strength of the nation but they must not be the concern of the federal government alone state and local entity and private enterprise should be encourage to participate in such project i would like to make special mention of program for make the good use of water rapidly become our most precious natural resource just as it can be when neglect a destroyer of both life and wealth there have be prepare and publish a comprehensive water report develop by a cabinet committee and relate to all phase of this particular problem in the light of this report there be two thing i believe we should keep constantly in mind the first be that each of our great river valley should be consider as a whole piecemeal operation within each less drainage area can be self defeat or at the very least needlessly expensive the second be that the domestic and industrial demand for water grow far more rapidly than do our population the whole matter of make the good use of each drop of water from the moment it touch our soil until it reach the ocean for such purpose as irrigation flood control power production and domestic and industrial use clearly demand the close kind of cooperation and partnership between municipality states and the federal government through partnership of federal state and local authority in these vast project we can obtain the economy and efficiency of development and operation that spring from a lively sense of local responsibility until such partnership be establish on a proper and logical basis of share authority responsibility and cost our country will never have both the fully productive use of water that it so obviously need and protection against disastrous flood if we fail in this all the many task that need to be do in america could be accomplish only at an excessive cost by the growth of a stifle bureaucracy and eventually with a dangerous degree of centralized control over our national life in all domestic matter i believe that the people of the united states will expect of we effective action to remedy past failure in meet critical need high priority should be give the school construction bill this will benefit child of all race throughout the country and child of all race need school now a program design to meet emergency need for more classroom should be enact without delay i be hopeful that this program can be enact on its own merit uncomplicate by provision deal with the complex problem of integration i urge the people in all section of the country to approach these problem with calm and reason with mutual understanding and good will and in the american tradition of deep respect for the orderly process of law and justice i should say here that we have much reason to be proud of the progress our people be make in mutual understanding the chief buttress of human and civil right steadily we be move close to the goal of fair and equal treatment of citizen without regard to race or color but unhappily much remain to be do last year the administration recommend to the congress a four point program to reinforce civil right that program included:(1 creation of a bipartisan commission to investigate asserted violation of civil right and to make recommendations;(2 creation of a civil right division in the department of justice in charge of an assistant attorney general;(3 enactment by the congress of new law to aid in the enforcement of voting right and(4 amendment of the law so as to permit the federal government to seek from the civil court preventive relief in civil right case i urge that the congress enact this legislation essential to the stable economic growth we seek be a system of well adapt and efficient financial institution i believe the time have come to conduct a broad national inquiry into the nature performance and adequacy of our financial system both in term of its direct service to the whole economy and in term of its function as the mechanism through which monetary and credit policy take effect i believe the congress should authorize the creation of a commission of able and qualified citizen to undertake this vital inquiry out of their finding and recommendation the administration would develop and present to the congress any legislative proposal that might be indicate for the purpose of improve our financial machinery in this message it seem unnecessary that i should repeat recommendation involve our domestic affair that have be urge upon the congress during the past four year but which in some instance do not reach the stage of completely satisfactory legislation the administration will through future message either directly from i or from head of the department and agency transmit to the congress specific recommendation these will involve our financial and fiscal affair our military and civil defense the administration of justice our agricultural economy our domestic and foreign commerce the urgently need increase in our postal rate the development of our natural resource our labor law include our labor management relation legislation and vital aspect of the health education and welfare of our people there will be special recommendation deal with such subject as atomic energy the furthering of public work the continue effort to eliminate government competition with the business of tax pay citizen a number of legislative recommendation will be mention specifically in my forthcoming budget message which will reach you within the week that message will also recommend such sum as be need to implement the propose action turn to the international scene the existence of a strongly armed imperialistic dictatorship pose a continue threat to the free world 's and thus to our own nation 's security and peace there be certain truth to be remember here first america alone and isolated can not assure even its own security we must be join by the capability and resolution of nation that have prove themselves dependable defender of freedom isolation from they invite war our security be also enhance by the immeasurable interest that join we with all people who believe that peace with justice must be preserve that war of aggression be crime against humanity another truth be that our survival in today 's world require modern adequate dependable military strength our nation have make great stride in assure a modern defense so armed in new weapon so deploy so equipped that today our security force be the most powerful in our peacetime history it can punish heavily any enemy who undertake to attack we it be a major deterrent to war by our research and development more efficient weapon some of amazing capability be be constantly create these vital effort we shall continue yet we must not delude ourselves that safety necessarily increase as expenditure for military research or force in be go up indeed beyond a wise and reasonable level which be always change and be under constant study money spend on arm may be money waste on sterile metal or inflated cost thereby weaken the very security and strength we seek national security require far more than military power economic and moral factor play indispensable role any program that endanger our economy could defeat we any weakening of our national will and resolution any diminution of the vigor and initiative of our individual citizen would strike a blow at the heart of our defense the fine military establishment we can produce must work closely in cooperation with the force of our friend our system of regional pact develop within the charter of the united nations serve to increase both our own security and the security of other nation this system be still a recent introduction on the world scene its problem be many and difficult because it insist on equality among its member and bring into association some nation traditionally divide repeatedly in recent month the collapse of these regional alliance have be predict the strain upon they have be at time indeed severe despite these strain our regional alliance have prove durable and strong and dire prediction of their disintegration have prove completely false with other free nation we should vigorously prosecute measure that will promote mutual strength prosperity and welfare within the free world strength be essentially a product of economic health and social well being consequently even as we continue our program of military assistance we must emphasize aid to our friend in build more productive economy and in well satisfy the natural demand of their people for progress thereby we shall move a long way toward a peaceful world a sound and safeguard agreement for open sky unarmed aerial sentinel and reduce armament would provide a valuable contribution toward a durable peace in the year ahead and we have be persistent in our effort to reach such an agreement we be willing to enter any reliable agreement which would reverse the trend toward ever more devastating nuclear weapon reciprocally provide against the possibility of surprise attack mutually control the outer space missile and satellite development and make feasible a low level of armament and armed force and an easy burden of military expenditure our continue negotiation in this field be a major part of our quest for a confident peace in this atomic age this quest require as well a constructive attitude among all the nation of the free world toward expansion of trade and investment that can give all of we opportunity to work out economic betterment an essential step in this field be the provision of an administrative agency to insure the orderly and proper operation of exist arrangement trader which multilateral trade be now carry on to that end i urge congressional authorization for united states membership in the propose organization for trade cooperation an action which will speed removal of discrimination against our export trade we welcome the effort of a number of our european friend to achieve an integrated community to develop a common market we likewise welcome their cooperative effort in the field of atomic energy to demonstrate once again our unalterable purpose to make of the atom a peaceful servant of humanity i shortly shall ask the congress to authorize full united states participation in the international atomic energy agency world event have magnify both the responsibility and the opportunity of the united states information agency just as in recent month the voice of communism have become more shake and confuse the voice of truth must be more clearly hear to enable our information agency to cope with these new responsibility and opportunity i be ask the congress to increase appreciably the appropriation for this program and for legislation establish a career service for the agency 's overseas foreign service officer the recent historic event in hungary demand that all free nation share to the extent of their capability in the responsibility of grant asylum to victim of communist persecution i request the congress promptly to enact legislation to regularize the status in the united states of hungarian refugee bring here as parolee i shall shortly recommend to the congress by special message the change in our immigration law that i deem necessary in the light of our world responsibility the cost of peace be something we must face boldly fearlessly beyond money it involve change in attitude the renunciation of old prejudice even the sacrifice of some seem self interest only five day ago i express to you the grave concern of your government over the threat of soviet aggression in the middle east i ask for congressional authorization to help counter this threat i say again that this matter be of vital and immediate importance to the nation 's and the free world 's security and peace by our propose program in the middle east we hope to assist in establish a climate in which constructive and long term solution to basic problem of the area may be seek from time to time there will be present to the congress request for other legislation in the broad field of international affair all request will reflect the steadfast purpose of this administration to pursue peace base on justice although in some case detail will be new the underlie purpose and objective will remain the same all proposal make by the administration in this field be base on the free world 's unity this unity may not be immediately obvious unless we examine link by link the chain of relationship that bind we to every area and to every nation in spirit the free world be one because its people uphold the right of independent existence for all nation i have already allude to their economic interdependence but their interdependence extend also into the field of security first of all no reasonable man will question the absolute need for our american neighbor to be prosperous and secure their security and prosperity be inextricably bind to our own and we be of course already join with these neighbor by historic pledge again no reasonable man will deny that the freedom and prosperity and security of western europe be vital to our own prosperity and security if the institution the skill the manpower of its people be to fall under the domination of an aggressive imperialism the violent change in the balance of world power and in the pattern of world commerce could not be fully compensate for by any american measure military or economic but these people whose economic strength be largely dependent on free and uninterrupted movement of oil from the middle east can not prosper indeed their economy would be severely impaired should that area be control by an enemy and the movement of oil be subject to its decision next to the eastward be asiatic and far eastern people recently return to independent control of their own affair or now emerge into sovereign statehood their potential strength constitute new assurance for stability and peace in the world if they can retain their independence should they lose freedom and be dominate by an aggressor the world wide effect would imperil the security of the free world in short the world have so shrink that all free nation be our neighbor without cooperative neighbor the united states can not maintain its own security and welfare because first america 's vital interest be world wide embrace both hemisphere and every continent second we have community of interest with every nation in the free world third interdependence of interest require a decent respect for the right and the peace of all people these principle motivate our action within the united nations there before all the world by our loyalty to they by our practice of they let we strive to set a standard to which all who seek justice and who hunger for peace can rally may we at home here at the seat of government in all the city and town and farmland of america support these principle in a personal effort of dedication thereby each of we can help establish a secure world order in which opportunity for freedom and justice will be more widespread and in which the resource now dissipate on the armament of war can be release for the life and growth of all humanity when our forefather prepare the immortal document that proclaim our independence they

mr. president mr. speaker members of the 85th congress it be again my high privilege to extend personal greeting to the member of the 85th congress all of we realize that as this new session begin many americans be troubled about recent world development which they believe may threaten our nation 's safety honest man differ in their appraisal of america 's material and intellectual strength and the danger that confront we but all know these danger be real the purpose of this message be to outline the measure that can give the american people a confidence just as real in their own security i be not here to justify the past glos over the problem of the present or propose easy solution for the future i be here to state what i believe to be right and what i believe to be wrong and to propose action for correct what i think wrong!i.there be two task confront we that so far outweigh all other that i shall devote this year 's message entirely to they the first be to ensure our safety through strength as to our strength i have repeatedly voice this conviction we now have a broadly base and efficient defensive strength include a great deterrent power which be for the present our main guarantee against war but unless we act wisely and promptly we could lose that capacity to deter attack or defend ourselves my profound conviction be that the american people will say as one man no matter what the exertion or sacrifice we shall maintain that necessary strength!but we could make no more tragic mistake than merely to concentrate on military strength for if we do only this the future would hold nothing for the world but an age of terror and so our second task be to do the constructive work of build a genuine peace we must never become so preoccupied with our desire for military strength that we neglect those area of economic development trade diplomacy education idea and principle where the foundation of real peace must be lay ii.the threat to our safety and to the hope of a peaceful world can be simply state it be communist imperialism this threat be not something imagine by critic of the soviets soviet spokesman from the beginning have publicly and frequently declare their aim to expand their power one way or another throughout the world the threat have become increasingly serious as this expansionist aim have be reinforce by an advance industrial military and scientific establishment but what make the soviet threat unique in history be its all inclusiveness every human activity be press into service as a weapon of expansion trade economic development military power art science education the whole world of idea all be harness to this same chariot of expansion the soviets be in short wage total cold war the only answer to a regime that wage total cold war be to wage total peace this mean bring to bear every asset of our personal and national life upon the task of build the condition in which security and peace can grow iii.among our asset let we first briefly glance at our military power military power serve the cause of security by make prohibitive the cost of any aggressive attack it serve the cause of peace by hold up a shield behind which the patient constructive work of peace can go on but it can serve neither cause if we make either of two mistake the one would be to overestimate our strength and thus neglect crucially important action in the period just ahead the other would be to underestimate our strength thereby we might be tempt to become irresolute in our foreign relation to dishearten our friend and to lose our national poise and perspective in approach the complex problem ahead any orderly balance sheet of military strength must be in two part the first be the position as of today the second be the position in the period ahead as of today our defensive shield comprehend a vast complex of ground sea and air unit superbly equip and strategically deploy around the world the most powerful deterrent to war in the world today lie in the retaliatory power of our strategic air command and the aircraft of our navy they present to any potential attacker who would unleash war upon the world the prospect of virtual annihilation of his own country even if we assume a surprise attack on our basis with a mark reduction in our strike power our bomber would immediately be on their way in sufficient strength to accomplish this mission of retaliation every informed government know this it be no secret since the korean armistice the american people have spend $ 225 billion in maintain and strengthen this overall defensive shield this be the position as of today now as to the period ahead every part of our military establishment must and will be equip to do its defensive job with the most modern weapon and method but it be particularly important to our planning that we make a candid estimate of the effect of long range ballistic missile on the present deterrent power i have describe at this moment the consensus of opinion be that we be probably somewhat behind the soviets in some area of long range ballistic missile development but it be my conviction base on close study of all relevant intelligence that if we make the necessary effort we will have the missile in the need quantity and in time to sustain and strengthen the deterrent power of our increasingly efficient bomber one encouraging fact evidence this ability be the rate of progress we have achieve since we begin to concentrate on these missile the intermediate ballistic missile thor and jupiter have already be order into production the parallel progress in the intercontinental ballistic missile effort will be advance by our plan for acceleration the development of the submarine base polaris missile system have progress so well that its future procurement schedule be be move forward markedly when it be remember that our country have concentrate on the development of ballistic missile for only about a third as long as the soviets these achievement show a rate of progress that speak for itself only a brief time back we be spend at the rate of only about one million dollar a year on long range ballistic missile in 1957 we spend more than one billion dollar on the arias titan thor jupiter and polaris program alone but i repeat gratify though this rate of progress be we must still do more!our real problem then be not our strength today it be rather the vital necessity of action today to ensure our strength tomorrow what i have just say apply to our strength as a single country but we be not alone i have return from the recent nato meeting with renew conviction that because we be a part of a world wide community of free and peaceful nation our own security be immeasurably increase by contrast the soviet union have surround itself with captive and sullen nation like a crack in the crust of an uneasily sleep volcano the hungarian uprising reveal the depth and intensity of the patriotic longing for liberty that still burn within these country the world think of we as a country which be strong but which will never start a war the world also think of we as a land which have never enslave anyone and which be animate by humane ideal this friendship base on common ideal be one of our great source of strength it cement into a cohesive security arrangement the aggregate of the spiritual military and economic strength of all those nation which with we be ally by treaty and agreement up to this point i have talk solely about our military strength to deter a possible future war i now want to talk about the strength we need to win a different kind of war one that have already be launch against we it be the massive economic offensive that have be mount by the communist imperialist against free nation the communist imperialist regime have for some time be largely frustrated in their attempt at expansion base directly on force as a result they have begin to concentrate heavily on economic penetration particularly of newly develop country as a preliminary to political domination this non military drive if underestimate could defeat the free world regardless of our military strength this danger be all the great precisely because many of we fail or refuse to recognize it thus some people may be tempt to finance our extra military effort by cut economic assistance but at the very time when the economic threat be assume menacing proportion to fail to strengthen our own effort would be nothing less than reckless folly admittedly most of we do not anticipate the psychological impact upon the world of the launching of the first earth satellite let we not make the same kind of mistake in another field by fail to anticipate the much more serious impact of the soviet economic offensive as with our military potential our economic asset be more than equal to the task our independent farmer produce an abundance of food and fibre our free worker be versatile intelligent and hardworke our businessman be imaginative and resourceful the productivity the adaptability of the american economy be the solid foundation stone of our security structure we have just conclude another prosperous year our output be once more the great in the nation 's history in the latter part of the year some decline in employment and output occur follow the exceptionally rapid expansion of recent year in a free economy reflect as it do the independent judgment of million of people growth typically move forward unevenly but the basic force of growth remain unimpaired there be solid ground for confidence that economic growth will be resume without an extended interruption moreover the federal government constantly alert to sign of weaken in any part of our economy always stand ready with its full power to take any appropriate further action to promote renew business expansion if our history teach we anything it be this lesson so far as the economic potential of our nation be concern the believer in the future of america have always be the realist i count myself as one of this company our long range problem then be not the stamina of our enormous engine of production our problem be to make sure that we use these vast economic force confidently and creatively not only in direct military defense effort but likewise in our foreign policy through such activity as mutual economic aid and foreign trade in much the same way we have tremendous potential resource on other non military front to help in counter the soviet threat education science research and not least the idea and principle by which we live and in all these case the task ahead be to bring these resource more sharply to bear upon the new task of security and peace in a swiftly change world iv.there be many item in the administration 's program of a kind frequently include in a state of the union message with which i be not deal today they be important to we and to our prosperity but i be reserve they for treatment in separate communication because of my purpose today of speak only about matter bear directly upon our security and peace i now place before you an outline of action design to focus our resource upon the two task of security and peace in this special category i list eight item require action they be not merely desirable they be imperative.1 defense reorganizationthe first need be to assure ourselves that military organization facilitate rather than hinder the functioning of the military establishment in maintain the security of the nation since world war ii the purpose of achieve maximum organizational efficiency in a modern defense establishment have several time occasioned action by the congress and by the executive the advent of revolutionary new device bring with they the problem of overall continental defense create new difficulty reminiscent of those attend the advent of the airplane half a century ago some of the important new weapon which technology have produce do not fit into any exist service pattern they cut across all service involve all service and transcend all service at every stage from development to operation in some instance they defy classification accord to branch of service unfortunately the uncertainty result from such a situation and the jurisdictional dispute attend upon it tend to bewilder and confuse the public and create the impression that service difference be damage the national interest let we proudly remember that the member of the armed forces give their basic allegiance solely to the united states of that fact all of we be certain but pride of service and mistaken zeal in promote particular doctrine have more than once occasion the kind of difficulty of which i have just speak i be not attempt today to pass judgment on the charge of harmful service rivalry but one thing be sure whatever they be america want they stop recently i have have under special study the never end problem of efficient organization complicate as it be by new weapon soon my conclusion will be finalize i shall promptly take such executive action as be necessary and in a separate message i shall present appropriate recommendation to the congress meanwhile without anticipate the detailed form that a reorganization should take i can state its main line in term of objective a major purpose of military organization be to achieve real unity in the defense establishment in all the principal feature of military activity of all these one of the most important to our nation 's security be strategic planning and control this work must be do under unified direction the defense structure must be one which as a whole can assume with top efficiency and without friction the defense of america the defense establishment must therefore plan for a well integration of its defensive resource particularly with respect to the new weapon now build and under development these obviously require full coordination in their development production and use good organization can help assure this coordination in recognition of the need for single control in some of our most advanced development project the secretary of defense have already decide to concentrate into one organization all the anti missile and satellite technology undertake within the department of defense another requirement of military organization be a clear subordination of the military service to duly constitute civilian authority this control must be real not merely on the surface next there must be assurance that an excessive number of compartment in organization will not create costly and confusing compartment in our scientific and industrial effort finally to end inter service dispute require clear organization and decisive central direction support by the unstinted cooperation of every individual in the defense establishment civilian and military.2 accelerated defense effortthe second major action item be the acceleration of the defense effort in particular area affect by the fast pace of scientific and technological advance some of the point at which improve and increase effort be most essential be these we must have sure warn in case of attack the improvement of warning equipment be become increasingly important as we approach the period when long range missile will come into use we must protect and disperse our strike force and increase their readiness for instant reaction this mean more base facility and standby crew we must maintain deterrent retaliatory power this mean among other thing step up long range missile program accelerate program for other effective missile system and for some year more advanced aircraft we must maintain freedom of the sea this mean nuclear submarine and cruiser improve anti submarine weapon missile ship and the like we must maintain all necessary type of mobile force to deal with local conflict should there be need this mean further improvement in equipment mobility tactic and fire power through increase in pay and incentive we must maintain in the armed force the skilled manpower modern military force require we must be forward look in our research and development to anticipate and achieve the unimagined weapon of the future with these and other improvement we intend to assure that our vigilance power and technical excellence keep abreast of any realistic threat we face.3 mutual aidthird we must continue to strengthen our mutual security effort most people now realize that our program of military aid and defense support be an integral part of our own defense effort if the foundation of the free world structure be progressively allow to crumble under the pressure of communist imperialism the entire house of freedom would be in danger of collapse as for the mutual economic assistance program the benefit to we be threefold first the country receive this aid become bulwark against communist encroachment as their military defense and economy be strengthen nation that be conscious of a steady improvement in their industry education health and standard of living be not apt to fall prey to the blandishment of communist imperialist second these country be help to reach the point where mutually profitable trade can expand between they and we third the mutual confidence that come from work together on constructive project create an atmosphere in which real understanding and peace can flourish to help bring these multiple benefit our economic aid effort should be make more effective in proposal for future economic aid i be stress a great use of repayable loan through the development loan fund through fund generate by sale of surplus farm product and through the export import bank while some increase in government fund will be require it remain our objective to encourage shift to the use of private capital source as rapidly as possible one great obstacle to the economic aid program in the past have be not a rational argument against it on the merit but a catchword give away program "the real fact be that no investment we make in our own security and peace can pay we great dividend than necessary amount of economic aid to friendly nation this be no give away "let 's stick to fact we can not afford to have one of our most essential security program shoot down with a slogan 4 mutual tradefourth both in our national interest and in the interest of world peace we must have a five year extension of the trade agreements act with broaden authority to negotiate world trade support a significant segment of american industry and agriculture it provide employment for four and one half million american worker it help supply our ever increase demand for raw material it provide the opportunity for american free enterprise to develop on a worldwide scale it strengthen our friend and increase their desire to be friend world trade help to lay the groundwork for peace by make all free nation of the world strong and more self reliant america be today the world 's great trading nation if we use this great asset wisely to meet the expand demand of the world we shall not only provide future opportunity for our own business agriculture and labor but in the process strengthen our security posture and other prospect for a prosperous harmonious world as president mckinley say as long ago as 1901 isolation be no long possible or desirable the period of exclusiveness be past "5 scientific cooperation with our alliesfifth it be of the high importance that the congress enact the necessary legislation to enable we to exchange appropriate scientific and technical information with friendly country as part of our effort to achieve effective scientific cooperation it be wasteful in the extreme for friendly ally to consume talent and money in solve problem that their friend have already solve all because of artificial barrier to share we can not afford to cut ourselves off from the brilliant talent and mind of scientist in friendly country the task ahead will be hard enough without handcuff of our own making the groundwork for this kind of cooperation have already be lay in discussion among nato country promptness in follow through with legislation will be the well possible evidence of american unity of purpose in cooperate with our friends.6 education and researchsixth in the area of education and research i recommend a balanced program to improve our resource involve an investment of about a billion dollar over a four year period this involve new activity by the department of health education and welfare design principally to encourage improve teaching quality and student opportunity in the interest of national security it also provide a five fold increase in sum available to the national science foundation for its special activity in stimulate and improve science education scrupulous attention have be pay to maintain local control of educational policy spur the maximum amount of local effort and to avoid undue stress on the physical science at the expense of other branch of learn in the field of research i be ask for substantial increase in basic research fund include a doubling of the fund available to the national science foundation for this purpose but federal action can do only a part of the job in both education and research redouble exertion will be necessary on the part of all americans if we be to rise to the demand of our time this mean hard work on the part of state and local government private industry school and college private organization and foundation teacher parent and perhaps most important of all the student himself with his bag of book and his homework with this kind of all inclusive campaign i have no doubt that we can create the intellectual capital we need for the year ahead invest it in the right place and do all this not as regimented pawn but as free man and woman 7 spending and savingseventh to provide for this extra effort for security we must apply stern test of priority to other expenditure both military and civilian this extra effort involve most immediately the need for a supplemental defense appropriation of $ 1.3 billion for fiscal year 1958.in the 1959 budget increase expenditure for missile nuclear ship atomic energy research and development science and education a special contingency fund to deal with possible new technological discovery and increase in pay and incentive to obtain and retain competent manpower add up to a total increase over the comparable figure in the 1957 budget of about $ 4 billion i believe that in spite of these necessary increase we should strive to finance the 1959 security effort out of expect revenue while we now believe that expect revenue and expenditure will roughly balance our real purpose will be to achieve adequate security but always with the utmost regard for efficiency and careful management this purpose will require the cooperation of congress in make careful analysis of estimate present reduce expenditure on less essential military program and installation postpone some new civilian program transfer some to the state and curtail or eliminate other such related matter as the national debt ceiling and tax revenue will be deal with in later messages.8 works of peacemy last call for action be not primarily address to the congress and people of the united states rather it be a message from the people of the united states to all other people especially those of the soviet union this be the spirit of what we would like to say:"in the last analysis there be only one solution to the grim problem that lie ahead the world must stop the present plunge toward more and more destructive weapon of war and turn the corner that will start our step firmly on the path toward last peace "our great hope for success lie in a universal fact the people of the world as people have always want peace and want peace now "the problem then be to find a way of translate this universal desire into action "this will require more than word of peace it require work of peace "now may i try to give you some concrete example of the kind of work of peace that might make a beginning in the new direction for a start our people should learn to know each other well recent negotiation in washington have provide a basis in principle for great freedom of communication and exchange of people i urge the soviet government to cooperate in turn principle into practice by prompt and tangible action that will break down the unnatural barrier that have block the flow of thought and understanding between our people another kind of work of peace be cooperation on project of human welfare for example we now have it within our power to eradicate from the face of the earth that age old scourge of mankind malaria we be embark with other nation in an all out five year campaign to blot out this curse forever we invite the soviets to join with we in this great work of humanity indeed we would be willing to pool our effort with the soviets in other campaign against the disease that be the common enemy of all mortal such as cancer and heart disease if people can get together on such project be it not possible that we could then go on to a full scale cooperative program of science for peace?we have as a guide and inspiration the success of our atom for peace proposal which in only a few year under united nations auspex become a reality in the international atomic energy agency a program of science for peace might provide a means of funnel into one place the result of research from scientist everywhere and from there make it available to all part of the world there be almost no limit to the human betterment that could result from such cooperation hunger and disease could increasingly be drive from the earth the age old dream of a good life for all could at long last be translate into reality but of all the work of peace none be more need now than a real first step toward disarmament last august the united nations general assembly by an overwhelming vote approve a disarmament plan that we and our ally sincerely believe to be fair and practical the soviets have reject both the plan and the negotiate procedure set up by the united nations as a result negotiation on this supremely important issue be now at a stand still but the world can not afford to stand still on disarmament we must never give up the search for a basis of agreement our ally from time to time develop differ idea on how to proceed we must concert these conviction among ourselves thereafter any reasonable proposal that hold promise for disarmament and reduction of tension must be hear discuss and if possible negotiate but a disarmament proposal to hold real promise must at the minimum have one feature reliable mean to ensure compliance by all it take action and demonstrate integrity on both side to create and sustain confidence and confidence in a genuine disarmament agreement be vital not only to the signer of the agreement but also to the million of people all over the world who be weary of tension and armament i say once more to all people that we will always go the extra mile with anyone on earth if it will bring we nearer a genuine peace conclusionthese then be the way in which we must funnel our energy more efficiently into the task of advance security and peace these action demand and expect two thing of the american people sacrifice and a high degree of understanding for sacrifice to be effective it must be intelligent sacrifice must be make for the right purpose and in the right place even if that place happen to come close to home after all it be no good demand sacrifice in general term one day and the next day for local reason oppose the elimination of some unneeded federal facility it be pointless to condemn federal spending in general and the next moment condemn just as strongly an effort to reduce the particular federal grant that touch one 's own interest and it make no sense whatever to spend additional billion on military strength to deter a potential danger and then by cut aid and trade program let the world succumb to a present danger in economic guise my friend of the congress the world be wait to see how wisely and decisively a free representative government will now act i believe that this congress possess and will display the wisdom promptly to do its part in translate into law the action demand by our nation 's interest but to make law effective our kind of government need the full voluntary support of million of americans for these action i be fully confident that the response of the congress and of the american people will make this time of test a time of honor mankind then will see more clearly than ever that the future belong not to the concept of the regiment atheistic state but to the people the god fear peace love people of all the world note this be the text of the document which the president sign and transmit to the senate and the house of representatives h. doc 251 85th cong 2d sess the address as report from the floor appear in the congressional record vol 104 p. 171
mr. president mr. speaker members of the 86th congress my fellow citizen this be the moment when congress and the executive annually begin their cooperative work to build a well america one basic purpose unite we to promote strength and security side by side with liberty and opportunity as we meet today in the 170th year of the republic our nation must continue to provide as all other free government have have to do throughout time a satisfactory answer to a question as old as history it be can government base upon liberty and the god give right of man permanently endure when ceaselessly challenge by a dictatorship hostile to our mode of life and control an economic and military power of great and grow strength?for we the answer have always be find and be still find in the devotion the vision the courage and the fortitude of our people moreover this challenge we face not as a single powerful nation but as one that have in recent decade reach a position of recognize leadership in the free world we have arrive at this position of leadership in an era of remarkable productivity and growth it be also a time when man 's power of mass destruction have reach fearful proportion possession of such capability help create world suspicion and tension we on our part know that we seek only a just peace for all with aggressive design against no one yet we realize that there be uneasiness in the world because of a belief on the part of people that through arrogance miscalculation or fear of attack catastrophic war could be launch keep the peace in today 's world more than ever call for the utmost in the nation 's resolution wisdom steadiness and unremitting effort we can not build peace through desire alone moreover we have learn the bitter lesson that international agreement historically consider by we as sacred be regard in communist doctrine and in practice to be mere scrap of paper the most recent proof of their disdain of international obligation solemnly undertake be their announce intention to abandon their responsibility respect berlin as a consequence we can have no confidence in any treaty to which communists be a party except where such a treaty provide within itself for self enforce mechanism indeed the demonstrate disregard of the communists of their own pledge be one of the great obstacle to success in substitute the rule of law for rule by force yet step by step we must strengthen the institution of peace a peace that rest upon justice a peace that depend upon a deep knowledge and dear understanding by all people of the cause and consequence of possible failure in this great purpose to achieve this peace we seek to prevent war at any place and in any dimension if despite our good effort a local dispute should flare into armed hostility the next problem would be to keep the conflict from spread and so compromise freedom in support of these objective we maintain force of great power and flexibility our formidable air strike force be a powerful deterrent to general war large and grow portion of these unit can depart from their basis in a matter of minute similar force be include in our naval fleet ground and other tactical formation can move with swiftness and precision when request by friendly and responsible government to help curb threaten aggression the stabilize influence of this capacity have be dramatically demonstrate more than once over the past year our military and related scientific progress have be highly gratifying great stride have be make in the development of ballistic missile intermediate range missile be now be deploy in operational unit the arias intercontinental ballistic missile program have be mark by rapid development as evidence by recent successful test missile training unit have be establish and launch site be far along in construction new aircraft that fly at twice the speed of sound be enter our squadron we have successfully place five satellite in orbit which have gather information of scientific importance never before available our late satellite illustrate our steady advance in rocketry and foreshadow new development in world wide communication warning system constantly improve our atomic submarine have shatter endurance record and make historic voyage under the north polar sea a major segment of our national scientific and engineering community be work intensively to achieve new and great development advance in military technology require adequate financing but of course even more it require talent and time all this be give only as a matter of history as a record of our progress in space and ballistic missile field in no more than four year of intensive effort at the same time we clearly recognize that some of the recent soviet accomplishment in this particular technology be indeed brilliant under the law enact last year the department of defense be be reorganize to give the secretary of defense full authority over the military establishment great efficiency more cohesive effort and speedy reaction to emergency be among the many advantage we be already note from these change these few highlight point up our steady military gain we be rightfully gratify by the achievement they represent but we must remember that these impose armament be purchase at great cost national security program account for nearly sixty percent of the entire federal budget for this come fiscal year modern weapon be exceedingly expensive the overall cost of introduce atlas into our armed force will average $ 35 million per missile on the firing line this year we be invest an aggregate of close to $ 7 billion in missile program alone other billion go for research development test and evaluation of new weapon system our late atomic submarine will cost $ 50 million each while some special type will cost three time as much we be now order fighter aircraft which be price at fifty time as much as the fighter of world war ii.we be buy certain bomber that cost their weight in gold these sum be tremendous even when compare with the marvelous resiliency and capacity of our economy such expenditure demand both balance and perspective in our planning for defense at every turn we must weigh judge and select needless duplication of weapon and force must be avoid we must guard against feverish building of vast armament to meet glibly predict moment of so call maximum peril the threat we face be not sporadic or date it be continuous hence we must not be sway in our calculation either by groundless fear or by complacency we must avoid extreme for vacillation between extreme be inefficient costly and destructive of morale in these day of uncease technological advance we must plan our defense expenditure systematically and with care fully recognize that obsolescence compel the never end replacement of old weapon with new one the defense budget for the come year have be plan on the basis of these principle and consideration over these many month i have personally participate in its development the aim be a sensible posture of defense the secondary aim be increase efficiency and avoidance of waste both be achieve by this budgetary plan work by these guide line i believe with all my heart that america can be as sure of the strength and efficiency of her armed force as she be of their loyalty i be equally sure that the nation will thus avoid useless expenditure which in the name of security might tend to undermine the economy and therefore the nation 's safety our own vast strength be only a part of that require for dependable security because of this we have join with nearly 50 other nation in collective security arrangement in these common undertaking each nation be expect to contribute what it can in share the heavy load each supply part of a strategic deployment to protect the forward boundary of freedom constantly we seek new way to make more effective our contribution to this system of collective security recently i have ask a committee of eminent americans of both party to re appraise our military assistance program and the relative emphasis which should be place on military and economic aid i be hopeful that preliminary recommendation of this committee will be available in time to assist in shape the mutual security program for the come fiscal year any survey of the free world 's defense structure can not fail to impart a feeling of regret that so much of our effort and resource must be devote to armament at geneva and elsewhere we continue to seek technical and other agreement that may help to open up with some promise the issue of international disarmament america will never give up the hope that eventually all nation can with mutual confidence drastically reduce these non productive expenditure ii.the material foundation of our national safety be a strong and expand economy this we have and this we must maintain only with such an economy can we be secure and simultaneously provide for the well being of our people a year ago the nation be experience a decline in employment and output today that recession be fade into history and this without gigantic hastily improvise public work project or untimely tax reduction a healthy and vigorous recovery have be under way since last may new home be be build at the high rate in several year retail sale be at peak level personal income be at an all time high the mark forward thrust of our economy reaffirm our confidence in competitive enterprise but clearly wisdom and prudence in both the public and private sector of the economy be always necessary our outlook be this 1960 commitment for our armed force the atomic energy commission and military assistance exceed 47 billion dollar in the foreseeable future they be not likely to be significantly low with an annual population increase of three million other governmental cost be bind to mount after we have provide wisely for our military strength we must judge how to allocate our remain government resource most effectively to promote our well being and economic growth federal program that will benefit all citizen be move forward next year we will be spend increase amount on health program on federal assistance to science and education on the development of the nation 's water resource on the renewal of urban area and on our vast system of federal aid highway each of these additional outlay be be make necessary by the surge growth of america let i illustrate responsive to this growth federal grant and long term loan to assist 14 major type of capital improvement in our city will total over 2 billion dollar in 1960 -double the expenditure of two year ago the major responsibility for development in these field rest in the locality even though the federal government will continue to do its proper part in meet the genuine need of a burgeon population but the progress of our economy can more than match the growth of our need we need only to act wisely and confidently here i hope you will permit i to digress long enough to express something that be much on my mind the basic question face we today be more than mere survival the military defense of national life and territory it be the preservation of a way of life we must meet the world challenge and at the same time permit no stagnation in america unless we progress we regress we can successfully sustain security and remain true to our heritage of freedom if we clearly visualize the task ahead and set out to perform they with resolution and fervor we must first define these task and then understand what we must do to perform they if progress be to be steady we must have long term guide extend far ahead certainly five possibly even ten year they must reflect the knowledge that before the end of five year we will have a population of over 190 million they must be goal that stand high and so inspire every citizen to climb always toward mount level of moral intellectual and material strength every advance toward they must stir pride in individual and national achievement to define these goal i intend to mobilize help from every available source we need more than politically ordain national objective to challenge the good effort of free man and woman a group of selfless and devoted individual outside of government could effectively participate in make the necessary appraisal of the potential of our future the result would be establishment of national goal that would not only spur we on to our fine effort but would meet the stern test of practicality the committee i plan will comprise educator and representative of labor management finance the profession and every other kind of useful activity such a study would update and supplement in the light of continuous change in our society and its economy the monumental work of the committee on recent social trends which be appoint in 1931 by president hoover its report have stand the test of time and have have a beneficial influence on national development the new committee would be concern among other thing with the acceleration of our economy 's growth and the living standard of our people their health and education their well assurance of life and liberty and their great opportunity it would also be concern with method to meet such goal and what level of government local state or federal might or should be particularly concern as one example consider our school operate under the authority of local community and state in their capacity and in their quality they conform to no recognizable standard in some place facility be ample in other meager pay of teacher range between wide limit from the adequate to the shameful as would be expect quality of teaching vary just as widely but to our teacher we commit the most valuable possession of the nation and of the family our child we must have teacher of competence to obtain and hold they we need standard we need a national goal once establish i be certain that public opinion would compel steady progress toward its accomplishment such study would be helpful i believe to government at all level and to all individual the goal so established could help we see our current need in perspective they will spur progress we do not forget of course that our nation 's progress and fiscal integrity be interdependent and inseparable we can afford everything we clearly need but we can not afford one cent of waste we must examine every item of governmental expense critically to do otherwise would betray our nation 's future thrift be one of the characteristic that have make this nation great why should we ignore it now?we must avoid any contribution to inflationary process which could disrupt sound growth in our economy price have display a welcome stability in recent month and if we be wise and resolute we will not tolerate inflation in the year to come but history make clear the risk inherent in any failure to deal firmly with the .basic cause of inflation two of the most important of these cause be the wage price spiral and continue deficit financing inflation would reduce job opportunity price we out of world market shrink the value of saving and penalize the thrift so essential to finance a grow economy inflation be not a robin hood take from the rich to give to the poor rather it deal most cruelly with those who can least protect themselves it strike hard those million of our citizen whose income do not quickly rise with the cost of living when price soar the pensioner and the widow see their security undermine the man of thrift see his saving melt away the white collar worker the minister and the teacher see their standard of living drag down inflation can be prevent but this demand statesmanship on the part of business and labor leader and of government at all level we must encourage the self discipline the restraint necessary to curb the wage price spiral and we must meet current cost from current revenue to minimize the danger of future soar price and to keep our economy sound and expand i shall present to the congress certain proposal first i shall submit a balanced budget for the next year a year expect to be the most prosperous in our history it be a realistic budget with wholly attainable objective if we can not live within our mean during such a time of rise prosperity the hope for fiscal integrity will fade if we persist in live beyond our mean we make it difficult for every family in our land to balance its own household budget but to live within our mean would be a tangible demonstration of the self discipline need to assure a stable dollar the constitution entrust the executive with many function but the congress and the congress alone have the power of the purse ultimately upon congress rest responsibility for determine the scope and amount of federal spending by work together the congress and the executive can keep a balance between income and outgo if this be do there be real hope that we can look forward to a time in the foreseeable future when need tax reform can be accomplish in this hope i be request the secretary of the treasury to prepare appropriate proposal for revise at the proper time our tax structure to remove inequity and to enhance incentive for all americans to work to save and to invest such recommendation will be make as soon as our fiscal condition permit these prospect will be brighten if 1960 expenditure do not exceed the level recommend second i shall recommend to the congress that the chief executive be give the responsibility either to approve or to veto specific item in appropriation and authorization bill this would save tax dollar i assure you gentleman that i know this recommendation have be make time and again by every president that have appear in this hall for many year but i say this it still be one of the most important correction that could be make in our annual expenditure program because this would save tax dollar third to reduce federal operation in an area where private enterprise can do the job i shall recommend legislation for great flexibility in extend federal credit and in improve the procedure under which private credit be insure or guarantee present practice have needlessly add large sum to federal expenditure fourth action be require to make more effective use of the large federal expenditure for agriculture and to achieve great fiscal control in this area outlay of the department of agriculture for the current fiscal year for the support of farm price on a very few farm product will exceed five billion dollar that be a sum equal to approximately two fifth of the net income of all farm operator in the entire united states by the end of this fiscal year it be estimate that there will be in government hand surplus farm product worth about nine billion dollar and by july 1 1959 government expenditure for storage interest and handling of its agricultural inventory will reach a rate of one billion dollar a year this level of expenditure for farm product could be make willingly for a temporary period if it be lead to a sound solution of the problem but unfortunately this be not true we need new legislation in the past i have send message to the congress request great freedom for our farmer to manage their own farm and great freedom for market to reflect the wish of producer and consumer legislative change that follow be appropriate in direction but do not go far enough the situation call for prompt and forthright action recommendation for action will be contain in a message to be transmit to the congress shortly these fiscal and related action will help create an environment of price stability for economic growth however certain additional measure be need i shall ask congress to amend the employment act of 1946 to make it clear that government intend to use all appropriate mean to protect the buying power of the dollar i be establish a continue cabinet group on price stability for economic growth to study governmental and private policy affect cost price and economic growth it will strive also to build a well public understanding of the condition necessary for maintain growth and price stability study be be undertake to improve our information on price wage and productivity i believe all citizen in all walk of life will support this program of action to accelerate economic growth and promote price stability iii.i take up next certain aspect of our international situation and our program to strengthen it america 's security can be assure only within a world community strong stable independent nation in which the concept of freedom justice and human dignity can flourish there can be no such thing as fortress america if ever we be reduce to the isolation imply by that term we would occupy a prison not a fortress the question whether we can afford to help other nation that want to defend their freedom but can not fully do so from their own mean have only one answer we can and we must we have be do so since 1947.our foreign policy have long be dedicate to build a permanent and just peace during the past six year our free world security arrangement have be bolster and the bond of freedom have be more closely knit our friend in western europe be experience new internal vitality and be increasingly more able to resist external threat over the year the world have come to understand clearly that it be our firm policy not to countenance aggression in lebanon taiwan and berlin our stand have be dear right and expressive of the determined will of a united people act with other free nation we have undertake the solemn obligation to defend the people of free berlin against any effort to destroy their freedom in the meantime we shall constantly seek meaningful agreement to settle this and other problem know full well that not only the integrity of a single city but the hope of all free people be at stake we need likewise to continue help to build the economic base so essential to the free world 's stability and strength the international monetary fund and the world bank have both fully prove their worth as instrument of international financial cooperation their executive directors have recommend an increase in each member country 's subscription i be request the congress for immediate approval of our share of these increase we be now negotiate with representative of the twenty latin american republics for the creation of an inter american financial institution its purpose would be to join all the american republics in a common institution which would promote and finance development in latin america and make more effective the use of capital from the world bank the export import bank and private source private enterprise continue to make major contribution to economic development in all part of the world but we have not yet marshal the full potential of american business for this task particularly in country which have recently attain their independence i shall present to this congress a program design to encourage great participation by private enterprise in economic development abroad far all of we know that to advance the cause of freedom we must do much more than help build sound economy the spiritual intellectual and physical strength of people throughout the world will in the last analysis determine their willingness and their ability to resist communism to give a single illustration of our many effort in these field we have be a participant in the effort that have be make over the past few year against one of the great scourge of mankind disease through the mutual security program public health official be be train by american university to serve in less develop country we be engage in intensive malaria eradication project in many part of the world america 's major success in our own country prove the feasibility of success everywhere by these and other mean we shall continue and expand our campaign against the affliction that now bring needless suffering and death to so many of the world 's people we wish to be part of a great shared effort toward the triumph of health iv.america be well describe by one word freedom if we hope to strengthen freedom in the world we must be ever mindful of how our own conduct react elsewhere no nation have ever be so floodlighted by world opinion as the united states be today everything we do be carefully scrutinize by other people throughout the world the bad be see along with the good because we be human we err but as free man we be also responsible for correct the error and imperfection of our way last january i make comprehensive recommendation to the congress for legislation in the labor management field to my disappointment congress fail to act the mcclellan committee disclosure of corruption racketeering and abuse of trust and power in labor management affair have arouse america and amazed other people they emphasize the need for improved local law enforcement and the enactment of effective federal legislation to protect the public interest and to insure the right and economic freedom of million of american worker halfhearted measure will not do i shall recommend prompt enactment of legislation design to safeguard worker fund in union treasury against misuse of any kind whatsoever to protect the right and freedom of individual union member include the basic right to free and secret election of officer to advance true and responsible collective bargaining to protect the public and innocent third party from unfair and coercive practice such as boycott and blackmail picketing the worker and the public must have these vital protection in other area of human right freedom from discrimination in voting in public education in access to job and in other respect the world be likewise watch our conduct the image of america abroad be not improve when school child through closing of some of our school and through no fault of their own be deprive of their opportunity for an education the government of a free people have no purpose more noble than to work for the maximum realization of equality of opportunity under law this be not the sole responsibility of any one branch of our government the judicial arm which have the ultimate authority for interpret the constitution have hold that certain state law and practice discriminate upon racial ground and be unconstitutional whenever the supremacy of the constitution of the united states be challenge i shall continue to take every action necessary to uphold it one of the fundamental concept of our constitutional system be that it guarantee to every individual regardless of race religion or national origin the equal protection of the law those of we who be privileged to hold public office have a solemn obligation to make meaningful this inspire objective we can fulfill that obligation by our leadership in teaching persuade demonstrating and in enforce the law we be make noticeable progress in the field of civil right we be move forward toward achievement of equality of opportunity for all people everywhere in the united states in the interest of the nation and of each of its citizen that progress must continue legislative proposal of the administration in this field will be submit to the congress early in the session all of we should help to make clear that the government be unite in the common purpose of give support to the law and the decision of the courts by move steadily toward the goal of great freedom under law for our own people we shall be the well prepared to work for the cause of freedom under law throughout the world all people be solely tired of the fear destruction and the waste of war as never before the world know the human and material cost of war and seek to replace force with a genuine role of law among nation it be my purpose to intensify effort during the come two year in seek way to supplement the procedure of the united nations and other body with similar objective to the end that the rule of law may replace the rule of force in the affair of nation measure toward this end will be propose later include a re examination of our own relation to the international court of justice finally let we remind ourselves that marxist scripture be not new it be not the gospel of the future its basic objective be dictatorship old as history what be new be the shine prospect that man can build a world where all can live in dignity we seek victory not over any nation or people but over the ancient enemy of we all victory over ignorance poverty disease and human degradation wherever they may be find we march in the noblest of cause human freedom if we make ourselves worthy of america 's ideal if we do not forget that our nation be found on the premise that all man be creature of god 's making the world will come to know that it be free man who carry forward the true promise of human progress and dignity note this be the text of the document which the president sign and transmit to the senate and the house of representatives h. doc 1 86th cong 1st sess the address as report from the floor appear in the congressional record of january 9 1959 vol 105 p. 163
mr. president mr. speaker members of the 86th congress seven year ago i enter my present office with one long hold resolve override all other i be then and remain now determine that the united states shall become an ever more potent resource for the cause of peace realize that peace can not be for ourselves alone but for people everywhere this determination be share by the entire congress indeed by all americans my purpose today be to discuss some feature of america 's position both at home and in her relation to other first i point out that for we annual self examination be make a definite necessity by the fact that we now live in a divided world of uneasy equilibrium with our side commit to its own protection and against aggression by the other with both side of this divide world in possession of unbelievably destructive weapon mankind approach a state where mutual annihilation become a possibility no other fact of today 's world equal this in importance it color everything we say plan and do there be demand of we vigilance determination and the dedication of whatever portion of our resource that will provide adequate security especially a real deterrent to aggression these thing we be do all these fact emphasize the importance of strive incessantly for a just peace only through the strengthening of the spiritual intellectual economic and defensive resource of the free world can we in confidence make progress toward this goal second we note that recent soviet deportment and pronouncement suggest the possible opening of a somewhat less strained period in the relationship between the soviet union and the free world if these pronouncement be genuine there be bright hope of diminish the intensity of past rivalry and eventually of substitute persuasion for coercion whether this be to become an era of last promise remain to be test by action third we now stand in the vestibule of a vast new technological age one that despite its capacity for human destruction have an equal capacity to make poverty and human misery obsolete if our effort be wisely direct and if our unremitting effort for dependable peace begin to attain some success we can surely become participant in create an age characterize by justice and rise level of human well being over the past year the soviet union have express an interest in measure to reduce the common peril of war while neither we nor any other free world nation can permit ourselves to be mislead by pleasant promise until they be test by performance yet we approach this apparently new opportunity with the utmost seriousness we must strive to break the calamitous cycle of frustration and crisis which if unchecked could spiral into nuclear disaster the ultimate insanity though the need for dependable agreement to assure against resort to force in settle dispute be apparent to both side yet as in other issue divide man and nation we can not expect sudden and revolutionary result but we must find some place to begin one obvious road on which to make a useful start be in the widening of communication between our two people in this field there be both side willing countless opportunity most of they well know to we all for develop mutual understanding the true foundation of peace another avenue may be through the reopening on january twelfth of negotiation look to a control ban on the testing of nuclear weapon unfortunately the closing statement from the soviet scientist who meet with our scientist at geneva in an unsuccessful effort to develop an agree basis for a test ban give the clear impression that their conclusion have be politically guide those of the british and american scientific representative be their own freely form individual and collective opinion i be hopeful that as new negotiation begin truth not political opportunism will be the guide light of the deliberation still another avenue may be find in the field of disarmament in which the soviets have profess a readiness to negotiate seriously they have not however make clear the plan they may have if any for mutual inspection and verification the essential condition for any extensive measure of disarmament there be one instance where our initiative for peace have recently be successful a multi lateral treaty sign last month provide for the exclusively peaceful use of antarctica assure by a system of inspection it provide for free and cooperative scientific research in that continent and prohibit nuclear explosion there pende general international agreement on the subject the treaty be a significant contribution toward peace international cooperation and the advancement of science i shall transmit its text to the senate for consideration and approval in the near future the united states be always ready to participate with the soviet union in serious discussion of these or any other subject that may lead to peace with justice certainly it be not necessary to repeat that the united states have no intention of interfere in the internal affair of any nation likewise we reject any attempt to impose its system on we or on other people by force or subversion this concern for the freedom of other people be the intellectual and spiritual cement which have ally we with more than forty other nation in a common defense effort not for a moment do we forget that our own fate be firmly fasten to that of these country we will not act in any way which would jeopardize our solemn commitment to they we and our friend be of course concern with self defense grow out of this concern be the realization that all people of the free world have a great stake in the progress in freedom of the uncommitted and newly emerge nation these people desperately hope to lift themselves to decent level of living must not by our neglect be force to seek help from and finally become virtual satellite of those who proclaim their hostility to freedom their natural desire for a well life must not be frustrate by withhold from they necessary technical and investment assistance this be a problem to be solve not by america alone but also by every nation cherish the same ideal and in position to provide help in recent year america 's partner and friend in western europe and japan have make great economic progress their newly find economic strength be eloquent testimony to the striking success of the policy of economic cooperation which we and they have pursue the international economy of 1960 be markedly different from that of the early postwar year no long be the united states the only major industrial country capable of provide substantial amount of the resource so urgently need in the newly develop country to remain secure and prosperous themselves wealthy nation must extend the kind of cooperation to the less fortunate member that will inspire hope confidence and progress a rich nation can for a time without noticeable damage to itself pursue a course of self indulgence make its single goal the material ease and comfort of its own citizen thus repudiate its own spiritual and material stake in a peaceful and prosperous society of nation but the enmity it will incur the isolation into which it will descend and the internal moral and physical softness that will be engender will in the long term bring it to disaster america do not become great through softness and self indulgence her miraculous progress and achievement flow from other quality far more worthy and substantial:--adherence to principle and method consonant with our religious philosophy   --a satisfaction in hard work   --the readiness to sacrifice for worthwhile cause   --the courage to meet every challenge to her progress   --the intellectual honesty and capacity to recognize the true path of her own good interest to we and to every nation of the free world rich or poor these quality be necessary today as never before if we be to march together to great security prosperity and peace i believe the industrial country be ready to participate actively in supplement the effort of the develop country to achieve progress the immediate need for this kind of cooperation be underscore by the strain in our international balance of payment our surplus from foreign business transaction have in recent year fall substantially short of the expenditure we make abroad to maintain our military establishment overseas to finance private investment and to provide assistance to the less developed nation in 1959 our deficit in balance of payment approach $ 4 billion continue deficit of anything like this magnitude would over time impair our own economic growth and check the forward progress of the free world we must meet this situation by promote a rise volume of export and world trade far we must induce all industrialize nation of the free world to work together in a new cooperative endeavor to help lift the scourge of poverty from less fortunate nation this will provide for well sharing of this burden and for still far profitable trade new nation and other struggle with the problem of development will progress only if they demonstrate faith in their own destiny and possess the will and use their own resource to fulfill it moreover progress in a national transformation can be only gradually earn there be no easy and quick way to follow from the oxcart to the jet plane but just as we draw on europe for assistance in our early year so now do those new and emerge nation that have this faith and determination deserve help over the last fifteen year twenty nation have gain political independence other be do so each year most of they be woefully lack in technical capacity and in investment capital without free world support in these matter they can not effectively progress in freedom respect their need one of the major focal point of our concern be the south asian region here in two nation alone be almost five hundred million people all work and work hard to raise their standard and in do so to make of themselves a strong bulwark against the spread of an ideology that would destroy liberty i can not express to you the depth of my conviction that in our own and free world interest we must cooperate with other to help these people achieve their legitimate ambition as express in their different multi year plan through the world bank and other instrumentality as well as through individual action by every nation in position to help we must squarely face this titanic challenge all of we must realize of course that development in freedom by the newly emerge nation be no mere matter of obtain outside financial assistance an indispensable element in this process be a strong and continue determination on the part of these nation to exercise the national discipline necessary for any sustained development period these quality of determination be particularly essential because of the fact that the process of improvement will necessarily be gradual and laborious rather than revolutionary moreover everyone should be aware that the development process be no short term phenomenon many year be require for even the most favorably situate country i shall continue to urge the american people in the interest of their own security prosperity and peace to make sure that their own part of this great project be amply and cheerfully support free world decision in this matter may spell the difference between world disaster and world progress in freedom other country some of which i visit last month have similar need a common meeting ground be desirable for those nation which be prepared to assist in the development effort during the past year i have discuss this matter with the leader of several western nation because of its wealth of experience the organization for european economic cooperation could help with initial study the goal be to enlist all available economic resource in the industrialize free world especially private investment capital but i repeat that .this help no matter how great can be lastingly effective only if it be use as a supplement to the strength of spirit and will of the people of the newly develop nation by extend this help we hope to make possible the enthusiastic enrollment of these nation under freedom 's banner no more startling contrast to a system of sullen satellite could be imagine if we grasp this opportunity to build an age of productive partnership between the less fortunate nation and those that have already achieve a high state of economic advancement we will make bright the outlook for a world order base upon security freedom and peace otherwise the outlook could be dark indeed we face what may be a turning point in history and we must act decisively as a nation we can successfully pursue these objective only from a position of broadly base strength no matter how earnest be our quest for guaranteed peace we must maintain a high degree of military effectiveness at the same time we be engage in negotiate the issue of arm reduction until tangible and mutually enforceable arm reduction measure be work out we will not weaken the mean of defend our institution america possess an enormous defense power it be my studied conviction that no nation will ever risk general war against we unless we should be so foolish as to neglect the defense force we now so powerfully support it be world wide knowledge that any nation which might be tempt today to attack the united states even though our country might sustain great loss would itself promptly suffer a terrible destruction but i once again assure all people and all nation that the united states except in defense will never turn loose this destructive power during the past year our long range striking power unmatched today in manned bomber have take on new strength as the atlas intercontinental ballistic missile have enter the operational inventory in fourteen recent test launching at range of over 5,000 mile atlas have be strike on an average within two mile of the target this be less than the length of a jet runway well within the circle of total destruction such performance be a great tribute to american scientist and engineer who in the past five year have have to telescope time and technology to develop these long range ballistic missile where america have none before this year moreover grow number of nuclear power submarine will enter our active force some to be arm with polaris missile these remarkable ship and weapon range the ocean will be capable of accurate fire on target virtually anywhere on earth impossible to destroy by surprise attack they will become one of our most effective sentinel for peace to meet situation of less than general nuclear war we continue to maintain our carrier force our many service unit abroad our always ready army strategic force and marine corps division and the civilian component the continue modernization of these force be a costly but necessary process and be schedule to go forward at a rate which will steadily add to our strength the deployment of a portion of these force beyond our shore on land and sea be persuasive demonstration of our determination to stand shoulder to shoulder with our ally for collective security moreover i have direct that step be take to program our military assistance to these ally on a long range basis this be necessary for a sounder collective defense system next i refer to our effort in space exploration which be often mistakenly suppose to be an integral part of defense research and development first america have make great contribution in the past two year to the world 's fund of knowledge of astrophysic and space science these discovery be of present interest chiefly to the scientific community but they be important foundation stone for more extensive exploration of outer space for the ultimate benefit of all mankind second our military missile program go forward so successfully do not suffer from our present lack of very large rocket engine which be so necessary in distant space exploration i be assure by expert that the thrust of our present missile be fully adequate for defense requirement third the united states be press forward in the development of large rocket engine to place much heavy vehicle into space for exploration purpose fourth in the meantime it be necessary to remember that we have only begin to probe the environment immediately surround the earth use launch system presently available we be develop satellite to scout the world 's weather satellite relay station to facilitate and extend communication over the globe for navigation aid to give accurate bearing to ship and aircraft and for perfect instrument to collect and transmit the datum we seek this be the area hold the most promise for early and useful application of space technology fifth we have just complete a year 's experience with our new space law i believe it deficient in certain particular and suggest improvement will be submit shortly the accomplishment of the many task i have allude to require the continuous strengthening of the spiritual intellectual and economic sinew of american life the steady purpose of our society be to assure justice before god for every individual we must be ever alert that freedom do not wither through the careless amassing of restrictive control or the lack of courage to deal boldly with the giant issue of the day a year ago when i meet with you the nation be emerge from an economic downturn even though the sign of resurgent prosperity be not then sufficiently convincing to the doubtful today our surge strength be apparent to everyone 1960 promise to be the most prosperous year in our history yet we continue to be afflict by nag disorder among current problem that require solution are:--the need to protect the public interest in situation of prolong labor management stalemate;--the persistent refusal to come to grip with a critical problem in one sector of american agriculture;--the continue threat of inflation together with the persist tendency toward fiscal irresponsibility --in certain instance the denial to some of our citizen of equal protection of the law every american be disturb by the prolong dispute in the steel industry and the protract delay in reach a settlement we be all relieved that a settlement have at last be achieve in that industry percentagewise by this settlement the increase to the steel company in employment cost be low than in any prior wage settlement since world war ii it be also gratify to note that despite the increase in wage and benefit several of the major steel producer have announce that there will be no increase in steel price at this time the national interest demand that in the period of industrial peace which have be assure by the new contract both management and labor make every possible effort to increase efficiency and productivity in the manufacture of steel so that price increase can be avoid one of the lesson of this story be that the potential danger to the entire nation of long and great strike must be meet to insure against such possibility we must of course depend primarily upon the good commonsense of the responsible individual it be my intention to encourage regular discussion between management and labor outside the bargaining table to consider the interest of the public as well as their mutual interest in the maintenance of industrial peace price stability and economic growth to i it seem almost absurd for the united states to recognize the need and so earnestly to seek for cooperation among the nation unless we can achieve voluntary dependable abide cooperation among the important segment of our own free society failure to face up to basic issue in area other than those of labor management can cause serious strain on the firm freedom support of our society i refer to agriculture as one of these area our basic farm law be write 27 year ago in an emergency effort to redress hardship cause by a world wide depression they be continue and their economic distortion intensify during world war ii in order to provide incentive for production of food need to sustain a war tear free world today our farm problem be totally different it be that of effectively adjust to the change cause by a scientific revolution when the original farm law be write an hour 's farm labor produce only one fourth as much wheat as at present farm legislation be woefully out of date ineffective and expensive for year we have go on with an outmoded system which not only have fail to protect farm income but also have produce soar threaten surplus our farm have be leave produce for war while america have long be at peace once again i urge congress to enact legislation that will gear production more closely to market make costly surplus more manageable provide great freedom in farm operation and steadily achieve increase net farm income another issue that we must meet squarely be that of live within our mean this require restraint in expenditure constant reassessment of priority and the maintenance of stable price we must prevent inflation here be an opponent of so many guise that it be sometimes difficult to recognize but our clear need be to stop continuous and general price rise a need that all of we can see and feel to prevent steadily rise cost and price call for stern self discipline by every citizen no person city state or organized group can afford to evade the obligation to resist inflation for every american pay its crippling tax inflation 's ravage do not end at the water 's edge increase in price of the good we sell abroad threaten to drive we out of market that once be securely ours whether domestic price so high as to be noncompetitive result from demand for too high profit margin or from increase labor cost that outrun growth in productivity the final result be seriously damage to the nation we must fight inflation as we would a fire that imperil our home only by so do can we prevent it from destroy our salary saving pension and insurance and from gnaw away the very root of a free healthy economy and the nation 's security one major method by which the federal government can counter inflation and rise price be to insure that its expenditure be below its revenue the debt with which we be now confront be about 290 billion dollar with interest charge alone now cost taxpayer about 9 1/2 billion it be clear that this debt growth must stop you will be glad to know that despite the unsettling influence of the recent steel strike we estimate that our account will show on june 30 this year a favorable balance of approximately $ 200 million i shall present to the congress for 1961 a balanced budget in the area of defense expenditure continue at the record peace time level of the last several year with a single exception expenditure in every major category of health education and welfare will be equal or great than last year in space expenditure the amount be practically double but the over all guide goal of this budget be national need not response to specific group local or political insistence expenditure increase other than those i have indicate be largely account for by the increase cost of legislation previously enact i repeat this budget will be a balanced one expenditure will be 79 billion 8 hundred million the amount of income over outgo describe in the budget as a surplus to be apply against our national debt be 4 billion 2 hundred million personally i do not feel that any amount can be properly call a surplus as long as the nation be in debt i prefer to think of such an item as reduction on our child 's inherit mortgage once we have establish such payment as normal practice we can profitably make improvement in our tax structure and thereby truly reduce the heavy burden of taxation in any event this one reduction will save taxpayer each year approximately 2 hundred million dollar in interest cost this budget will help ease pressure in our credit and capital market it will enhance the confidence of people all over the world in the strength of our economy and our currency and in our individual and collective ability to be fiscally responsible in the management of the huge public debt the treasury be unfortunately not free of artificial barrier its ability to deal with the difficult problem in this field have be weaken greatly by the unwillingness of the congress to remove archaic restriction the need for a free hand in debt management be even more urgent today because the cost of the undesirable financing practice which the treasury have be force into be mount removal of this roadblock have high priority in my legislative recommendation still another issue relate to civil right in all our hope and plan for a well world we all recognize that provincial and racial prejudice must be combat in the long perspective of history the right to vote have be one of the strong pillar of a free society our first duty be to protect this right against all encroachment in spite of constitutional guarantee and notwithstanding much progress of recent year bias still deprive some person in this country of equal protection of the law early in your last session i recommend legislation which would help eliminate several practice discriminate against the basic right of americans the civil rights commission have develop additional constructive recommendation i hope that these will be among the matter to be seriously consider in the current session i trust that congress will thus signal to the world that our government be strive for equality under law for all our people each year and in many way our nation continue to undergo profound change and growth in the past 18 month we have hail the entry of two more state of the union alaska and hawaii we salute these two western star proudly our vigorous expansion which we all welcome as a sign of health and vitality be many sided we be for example witness explosive growth in metropolitan area by 1975 the metropolitan area of the united states will occupy twice the territory they do today the roster of urban problem with which they must cope be staggering they involve water supply clean the air adjust local tax system provide for essential educational cultural and social service and destroy those condition which breed delinquency and crime in meet these we must if we value our historic freedom keep within the traditional framework of our federal system with power divide between the national and state government the uniqueness of this system may confound the casual observer but it have work effectively for nearly 200 year i do not doubt that our urban and other perplexing problem can be solve in the traditional american method in do so we must realize that nothing be really solve and ruinous tendency be set in motion by yield to the deceptive bait of the easy federal tax dollar our educational system provide a ready example all recognize the vital necessity of have modern school plant well qualified and adequately compensate teacher and of use the good possible teaching technique and curriculum we can not be complacent about educate our youth but the route to well train mind be not through the swift administration of a federal hypodermic or sustain financial transfusion the educational process essentially a local and personal responsibility can not be make to leap ahead by crash centralized governmental action the administration have propose a carefully reason program for help eliminate current deficiency it be design to stimulate classroom construction not by substitution of federal dollar for state and local fund but by incentive to extend and encourage state and local effort this approach reject the notion of federal domination or control it be workable and should appeal to every american interested in advancement of our educational system in the traditional american way i urge the congress to take action upon it there be one other subject concern which i renew a recommendation i make in my state of the union message last january i then advise the congress of my purpose to intensify our effort to replace force with a rule of law among nation from many discussion abroad i be convinced that purpose be widely and deeply share by other people and nation of the world in the same message i state that our effort would include a reexamination of our own relation to the international court of justice the court be establish by the united nations to decide international legal dispute between nation in 1946 we accept the court 's jurisdiction but subject to a reservation of the right to determine unilaterally whether a matter lie essentially within domestic jurisdiction there be pende before the senate a resolution which would repeal our present self judge reservation i support that resolution and urge its prompt passage if this be do i intend to urge similar acceptance of the court 's jurisdiction by every member of the united nations here perhaps it be not amiss for i to say to the members of the congress in this my final year of office a word about the institution we respectively represent and the meaning which the relationship between our two branch have for the day ahead i be not unique as a president in having work with a congress control by the opposition party except that no other president ever do it for quite so long yet in both personal and official relationship we have weather the storm of the past five year for this i be grateful my deep concern in the next twelve month before my successor take office be with our joint congressional executive duty to our own and to other nation act upon the belief i have express here today i shall devote my full energy to the task at hand whether these involve travel for promote great world understanding negotiation to reduce international discord or constant discussion and communication with the congress and the american people on issue both domestic and foreign in pursuit of these objective i look forward to and shall dedicate myself to a close and constructive association with the congress every minute spend in irrelevant interbranch wrangling be precious time take from the intelligent initiation and adoption of coherent policy for our national survival and progress we seek a common goal bright opportunity for our own citizen and a world peace with justice for all before we and our friend be the challenge of an ideology which for more than four decade have trumpet abroad its purpose of gain ultimate victory over all form of government at variance with its own we realize that however much we repudiate the tenet of imperialistic communism it represent a gigantic enterprise grimly pursue by leader who compel its subject to subordinate their freedom of action and spirit and personal desire for some hope for advantage in the future the communists can present an array of material accomplishment over the past fifteen year that lend a false persuasiveness to many of their glitter promise to the uncommitted people the competition they provide be formidable but in our scale of value we place freedom first our whole national existence and development have be gear to that basic concept and be responsible for the position of free world leadership to which we have succeed it be the high prize that any nation can possess it be one that communism can never offer and america 's record of material accomplishment in freedom be write not only in the unparalleled prosperity of our own nation but in the many billion we have devote to the reconstruction of free world economic wreck by world war ii and in the effective help of many more billion we have give in save the independence of many other threaten by outside domination assuredly we have the capacity for handle the problem in the new era of the world 's history we be now enter but we must use that capacity intelligently and tirelessly regardless of personal sacrifice the fissure that divide our political planet be deep and wide we live moreover in a sea of semantic disorder in which old label no long faithfully describe police state be call people 's democracy "armed conquest of free people be call liberation "such slippery slogan make more difficult the problem of communicate true faith fact and belief we must make clear our peaceful intention our aspiration for a well world so do we must use language to enlighten the mind not as the instrument of the study innuendo and distorter of truth and we must live by what we say on my recent visit to distant land i find one statesman after another eager to tell i of the element of their government that have be borrow from our american constitution and from the indestructible ideal set forth in our declaration of independence as a nation we take pride that our own constitutional system and the ideal which sustain it have be long view as a fountainhead of freedom by our every action we must strive to make ourselves worthy of this trust ever mindful that an accumulation of seemingly minor encroachment upon freedom gradually could break down the entire fabric of a free society so persuade we shall get on with the task before we so dedicated and with faith in the almighty humanity shall one day achieve the unity in freedom to which all man have aspire from the dawn of time note this be the text of the document which the president sign and transmit to the senate and the house of representatives h. doc 241 86th cong 2d sess the address as report from the floor appear in the congressional record of january 7 1960 vol 106 p. 135
governor stevenson senator johnson mr. butler senator symington senator humphrey speaker rayburn fellow democrats i want to express my thank to governor stevenson for his generous and heart warm introduction

 it be my great honor to place his name in nomination at the 1956 democratic national convention and i be delighted to have his support and his counsel and his advice in the come month ahead

 with a deep sense of duty and high resolve i accept your nomination

 i accept it with a full and grateful heart without reservation and with only one obligation the obligation to devote every effort of body mind and spirit to lead our party back to victory and our nation back to greatness

 i be grateful too that you have provide i with such an eloquent statement of our party ’s platform pledge which be make so eloquently be make to be keep the rights of man,”—the civil and economic right essential to the human dignity of all man be indeed our goal and our first principle this be a platform on which i can run with enthusiasm and conviction

 and i be grateful finally that i can rely in the come month on so many other on a distinguished running mate who bring unity to our ticket and strength to our platform lyndon johnson on one of the most articulate statesman of our time adlai stevenson on a great spokesman for our need as a nation and a people stuart symington and on that fighting campaigner whose support i welcome president harry s. truman on my travel companion in wisconsin and west virginia senator hubert humphrey on paul butler our devoted and courageous chairman

 i feel a lot safe now that they be on my side again and i be proud of the contrast with our republican competitor for their rank be apparently so thin that not one challenger have come forth with both the competence and the courage to make theirs an open convention

 i be fully aware of the fact that the democratic party by nominate someone of my faith have take on what many regard as a new and hazardous risk new at least since 1928 but i look at it this way the democratic party have once again place its confidence in the american people and in their ability to render a free fair judgement to uphold the constitution and my oath of office and to reject any kind of religious pressure or obligation that might directly or indirectly interfere with my conduct of the presidency in the national interest my record of fourteen year support public education support complete separation of church and state and resist pressure from any source on any issue should be clear by now to everyone

 i hope that no american consider the really critical issue face this country will waste his franchise by vote either for i or against i solely on account of my religious affiliation it be not relevant i want to stress what some other political or religious leader may have say on this subject it be not relevant what abuse may have exist in other country or in other time it be not relevant what pressure if any might conceivably be bring to bear on i i be tell you now what you be entitle to know that my decision on any public policy will be my own as an american a democrat and a free man

 under any circumstance however the victory that we seek in november will not be easy we all know that in our heart we recognize the power of the force that will be align against we we know they will invoke the name of abraham lincoln on behalf of their candidate despite the fact that the political career of their candidate have often serve to show charity toward none and malice toward for all

 we know that it will not be easy to campaign against a man who have speak or vote on every know side of every know issue mr. nixon may feel it be his turn now after the new deal and the fair deal but before he deal someone have well cut the card

 that someone may be the million of americans who vote for president eisenhower but balk at his would be self appoint successor for just as historian tell we that richard i be not fit to fill the shoe of bold henry ii and that richard cromwell be not fit to wear the mantle of his uncle they might add in future year that richard nixon do not measure to the footstep of dwight d. eisenhower

 perhaps he could carry on the party policy the policy of nixon benson dirksen and goldwater but this nation can not afford such a luxury perhaps we could well afford a coolidge follow harding and perhaps we could afford a pierce follow fillmore

 but after buchanan this nation need a lincoln after taft we need a wilson after hoover we need franklin roosevelt and after eight year of drugged and fitful sleep this nation need strong creative democratic leadership in the white house

 but we be not merely run against mr. nixon our task be not merely one of itemize republican failure nor be that wholly necessary for the family force from the farm will know how to vote without our tell they the unemployed miner and textile worker will know how to vote the old people without medical care the family without a decent home the parent of child without adequate food or school they all know that it ’ time for a change

 but i think the american people expect more from we than cry of indignation and attack the time be too grave the challenge too urgent and the stake too high to permit the customary passion of political debate we be not here to curse the darkness but to light the candle that can guide we through that darkness to a safe and sane future as winston churchill say on take office some twenty year ago if we open a quarrel between the present and the past we shall be in danger of lose the future

 today our concern must be with the future for the world be change the old era be end the old way will not do

 abroad the balance of power be shift there be new and more terrible weapon new and uncertain nation new pressure of population and deprivation one third of the world it have be say may be free but one third be the victim of cruel repression and the other one third be rock by the pang of poverty hunger and envy more energy be release by the awakening of these new nation then by the fission of the atom itself

 meanwhile communist influence have penetrate far into asia stand astride in the middle east and now fester some ninety mile off the coast of florida friend have slip into neutrality and neutral into hostility as our keynoter remind we the president who begin his career by go to korea end it by stay away from japan

 the world have be close to war before but now man who have survive all previous threat to his existence have take into his mortal hand the power to exterminate the entire specie some seven time over

 here at home the change face of the future be equally revolutionary the new deal and the fair deal be bold measure for their generation but this be a new generation

 a technological revolution on the farm have lead we to an output explosion but we have not yet learn how to harness that explosion usefully while protect our farmer right to full parity income

 an urban population explosion have crowd our school clutter up our suburb and increase the squalor of our slum

 a peaceful revolution for human right demand an end to racial discrimination in all part of our community life have strain at the leash impose by timid executive leadership

 a medical revolution have extend the life of our elder citizen without provide the dignity and security those later year deserve and a revolution of automation find machine replace man in the mine and mill of america without replace their income or their training or their need to pay the family doctor grocer and landlord

 there have also be a change a slippage in our intellectual and moral strength seven lean year of drought and famine have wither a field of idea blight have descend on our regulatory agency and a dry rot begin in washington be seep into every corner of america in the payola mentality the expense account way of life the confusion between what be legal and what be right too many americans have lose their way their will and their sense of historic purpose

 it be a time in short for a new generation of leadership new man to cope with new problem and new opportunity

 all over the world particularly in the new nation young man be come to power man who be not bind by the tradition of the past man who be not blind by the old fear and hate and rivalry young man who can cast off the old slogan and delusion and suspicion

 the republican nominee to be of course be also a young man but his approach be as old as mckinley his party be the party of the past his speech be generality from poor richard ’s almanac their platform make up of leave over democratic plank have the courage of our old conviction their pledge be a pledge to the status quo and today there can be no status quo

 for i stand tonight face west on what be once the last frontier from the land that stretch three thousand mile behind i the pioneer of old give up their safety their comfort and sometimes their own life to build a new world here in the west they be not the captive of their own doubt the prisoner of their own price tag their motto be not every man for himself but all for the common cause they be determined to make that new world strong and free to overcome its hazard and its hardship to conquer the enemy that threaten from without and within

 today some would say that those struggle be all over that all the horizon have be explore that all the battle have be win that there be no long an american frontier

 but i trust that no one in this vast assemblage will agree with those sentiment for the problem be not all solve and the battle be not all win and we stand today on the edge of a new frontier the frontier of the 1960' a frontier of unknown opportunity and peril a frontier of unfulfilled hope and threat

 woodrow wilson ’s new freedom promise our nation a new political and economic framework franklin roosevelt ’s new deal promise security and succor to those in need but the new frontier of which i speak be not a set of promise it be a set of challenge it sum up not what i intend to offer the american people but what i intend to ask of they it appeal to their pride not to their pocketbook it hold out the promise of more sacrifice instead of more security

 but i tell you the new frontier be here whether we seek it or not beyond that frontier be the uncharted area of science and space unsolved problem of peace and war unconquered pocket of ignorance and prejudice unanswered question of poverty and surplus it would be easy to shrink back from that frontier to look to the safe mediocrity of the past to be lull by good intention and high rhetoric and those who prefer that course should not cast their vote for i regardless of party

 but i believe the time demand new invention innovation imagination decision i be ask each of you to be pioneer on that new frontier my call be to the young in heart regardless of age to all who respond to the scriptural call be strong and of good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed

 for courage not complacency be our need today leadership not salesmanship and the only valid test of leadership be the ability to lead and lead vigorously a tired nation say david lloyd george be a tory nation and the united states today can not afford to be either tired or tory

 there may be those who wish to hear more more promise to this group or that more harsh rhetoric about the man in the kremlin more assurance of a golden future where taxis be always low and subsidy ever high but my promise be in the platform you have adopt our end will not be win by rhetoric and we can have faith in the future only if we have faith in ourselves

 for the harsh fact of the matter be that we stand on this frontier at a turning point in history we must prove all over again whether this nation or any nation so conceive can long endure whether our society with its freedom of choice its breadth of opportunity its range of alternative can compete with the single minded advance of the communist system

 can a nation organize and govern such as ours endure that be the real question have we the nerve and the will can we carry through in an age where we will witness not only new breakthrough in weapon of destruction but also a race for mastery of the sky and the rain the ocean and the tide the far side of space and the inside of man ’s mind

 be we up to the task be we equal to the challenge be we willing to match the russian sacrifice of the present for the future or must we sacrifice our future in order to enjoy the present

 that be the question of the new frontier that be the choice our nation must make a choice that lie not merely between two man or two party but between the public interest and private comfort between national greatness and national decline between the fresh air of progress and the stale dank atmosphere of normalcy”—between determined dedication and creep mediocrity

 all mankind wait upon our decision a whole world look to see what we will do we can not fail their trust we can not fail to try

 it have be a long road from that first snowy day in new hampshire to this crowded convention city now begin another long journey take i into your city and home all over america give i your help your hand your voice your vote recall with i the word of isaiah they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wing as eagle they shall run and not be weary

 as we face the come challenge we too shall wait upon the lord and ask that he renew our strength then shall we be equal to the test then shall we not be weary and then we shall prevail

 thank you

reverend meza reverend reck i be grateful for your generous invitation to speak my view
 while the so call religious issue be necessarily and properly the chief topic here tonight i want to emphasize from the outset that we have far more critical issue to face in the 1960 election the spread of communist influence until it now fester 90 mile off the coast of florida the humiliating treatment of our president and vice president by those who no long respect our power the hungry child i see in west virginia the old people who can not pay their doctor bill the family force to give up their farm an america with too many slum with too few school and too late to the moon and outer space
 these be the real issue which should decide this campaign and they be not religious issue for war and hunger and ignorance and despair know no religious barrier
 but because i be a catholic and no catholic have ever be elect president the real issue in this campaign have be obscure perhaps deliberately in some quarter less responsible than this so it be apparently necessary for i to state once again not what kind of church i believe in for that should be important only to i but what kind of america i believe in
 i believe in an america where the separation of church and state be absolute where no catholic prelate would tell the president should he be catholic how to act and no protestant minister would tell his parishioner for whom to vote where no church or church school be grant any public fund or political preference and where no man be deny public office merely because his religion differ from the president who might appoint he or the people who might elect he
 i believe in an america that be officially neither catholic protestant nor jewish where no public official either request or accept instruction on public policy from the pope the national council of churches or any other ecclesiastical source where no religious body seek to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public act of its official and where religious liberty be so indivisible that an act against one church be treat as an act against all
 for while this year it may be a catholic against whom the finger of suspicion be point in other year it have be and may someday be again a jew or a quaker or a unitarian or a baptist it be virginia 's harassment of baptist preacher for example that help lead to jefferson 's statute of religious freedom today i may be the victim but tomorrow it may be you until the whole fabric of our harmonious society be rip at a time of great national peril
 finally i believe in an america where religious intolerance will someday end where all man and all church be treat as equal where every man have the same right to attend or not attend the church of his choice where there be no catholic vote no anti catholic vote no bloc voting of any kind and where catholics protestants and jews at both the lay and pastoral level will refrain from those attitude of disdain and division which have so often mar their work in the past and promote instead the american ideal of brotherhood
 that be the kind of america in which i believe and it represent the kind of presidency in which i believe a great office that must neither be humble by make it the instrument of any one religious group nor tarnish by arbitrarily withhold its occupancy from the member of any one religious group i believe in a president whose religious view be his own private affair neither impose by he upon the nation or impose by the nation upon he as a condition to hold that office
 i would not look with favor upon a president work to subvert the first amendment 's guarantee of religious liberty nor would our system of check and balance permit he to do so and neither do i look with favor upon those who would work to subvert article vi of the constitution by require a religious test even by indirection for it if they disagree with that safeguard they should be out openly work to repeal it
 i want a chief executive whose public act be responsible to all group and obligate to none who can attend any ceremony service or dinner his office may appropriately require of he and whose fulfillment of his presidential oath be not limit or condition by any religious oath ritual or obligation
 this be the kind of america i believe in and this be the kind i fight for in the south pacific and the kind my brother die for in europe no one suggest then that we might have a divide loyalty that we do not believe in liberty or that we belong to a disloyal group that threaten the freedom for which our forefather die
 and in fact this be the kind of america for which our forefather die when they flee here to escape religious test oath that deny office to member of less favored church when they fight for the constitution the bill of rights and the virginia statute of religious freedom and when they fight at the shrine i visit today the alamo for side by side with bowie and crockett die mccafferty and bailey and carey but no one know whether they be catholics or not for there be no religious test at the alamo
 i ask you tonight to follow in that tradition to judge i on the basis of my record of 14 year in congress on my declare stand against an ambassador to the vatican against unconstitutional aid to parochial school and against any boycott of the public school which i have attend myself)—instead of judge i on the basis of these pamphlet and publication we all have see that carefully select quotation out of context from the statement of catholic church leader usually in other country frequently in other century and always omit of course the statement of the american bishops in 1948 which strongly endorse church state separation and which more nearly reflect the view of almost every american catholic
 i do not consider these other quotation bind upon my public act why should you but let i say with respect to other country that i be wholly opposed to the state be use by any religious group catholic or protestant to compel prohibit or persecute the free exercise of any other religion and i hope that you and i condemn with equal fervor those nation which deny their presidency to protestants and those which deny it to catholics and rather than cite the misdeed of those who differ i would cite the record of the catholic church in such nation as ireland and france and the independence of such statesman as adenauer and de gaulle
 but let i stress again that these be my view for contrary to common newspaper usage i be not the catholic candidate for president i be the democratic party 's candidate for president who happen also to be a catholic i do not speak for my church on public matter and the church do not speak for i
 whatever issue may come before i as president in birth control divorce censorship gambling or any other subject i will make my decision in accordance with these view in accordance with what my conscience tell i to be the national interest and without regard to outside religious pressure or dictate and no power or threat of punishment could cause i to decide otherwise
 but if the time should ever come and i do not concede any conflict to be even remotely possible when my office would require i to either violate my conscience or violate the national interest then i would resign the office and i hope any conscientious public servant would do the same
 but i do not intend to apologize for these view to my critic of either catholic or protestant faith nor do i intend to disavow either my view or my church in order to win this election
 if i should lose on the real issue i shall return to my seat in the senate satisfied that i have try my good and be fairly judge but if this election be decide on the basis that 40 million americans lose their chance of be president on the day they be baptize then it be the whole nation that will be the loser in the eye of catholics and non catholics around the world in the eye of history and in the eye of our own people
 but if on the other hand i should win the election then i shall devote every effort of mind and spirit to fulfil the oath of the presidency practically identical i might add to the oath i have take for 14 year in the congress for without reservation i can solemly swear that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the good of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution so help i god

howard k. smith moderator good evening the television and radio station of the united states and their affiliated station be proud to provide facility for a discussion of issue in the current political campaign by the two major candidate for the presidency the candidate need no introduction the republican candidate vice president richard m. nixon and the democratic candidate senator john f. kennedy accord to rule set by the candidate themselves each man shall make an opening statement of approximately eight minute duration and a closing statement of approximately three minute duration in between the candidate will answer or comment upon answer to question put by a panel of correspondent in this the first discussion in a series of four uh joint appearance the subject matter have be agree will be restrict to internal or domestic american matter and now for the first opening statement by senator john f. kennedy

 senator kennedy mr. smith mr. nixon in the election of 1860 abraham lincoln say the question be whether this nation could exist half slave or half free in the election of 1960 and with the world around we the question be whether the world will exist half slave or half free whether it will move in the direction of freedom in the direction of the road that we be take or whether it will move in the direction of slavery i think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the united states on the kind of society that we build on the kind of strength that we maintain we discuss tonight domestic issue but i would not want that to be any implication to be give that this do not involve directly our struggle with mr. khrushchev for survival mr. khrushchev be in new york and he maintain the communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the soviet union itself the chinese communists have always have a large population but they be important and dangerous now because they be mount a major effort within their own country the kind of country we have here the kind of society we have the kind of strength we build in the united states will be the defense of freedom if we do well here if we meet our obligation if we be move ahead then i think freedom will be secure around the world if we fail then freedom fail therefore i think the question before the american people be be we do as much as we can do be we as strong as we should be be we as strong as we must be if we be go to maintain our independence and if we be go to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to we for assistance to those who look to we for survival i should make it very clear that i do not think we be do enough that i be not satisfied as an american with the progress that we be make this be a great country but i think it could be a great country and this be a powerful country but i think it could be a more powerful country i be not satisfied to have fifty percent of our steel mill capacity unused i be not satisfied when the united states have last year the low rate of economic growth of any major industrialize society in the world because economic growth mean strength and vitality it mean we be able to sustain our defense it mean we be able to meet our commitment abroad i be not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollar worth of food some of it rot even though there be a hungry world and even though four million americans wait every month for a food package from the government which average five cent a day per individual i see case in west virginia here in the united states where child take home part of their school lunch in order to feed their family because i do not think we be meet our obligation toward these americans i be not satisfied when the soviet union be turn out twice as many scientist and engineer as we be i be not satisfied when many of our teacher be inadequately pay or when our child go to school part time shift i think we should have an educational system second to none i be not satisfied when i see man like jimmy hoffa in charge of the large union in the united states still free i be not satisfied when we be fail to develop the natural resource of the united states to the full here in the united states which develop the tennessee valley and which build the grand coulee and the other dam in the northwest united states at the present rate of hydropow production and that be the hallmark of an industrialize society the soviet union by 1975 will be produce more power than we be these be all the thing i think in this country that can make our society strong or can mean that it stand still i be not satisfied until every american enjoy his full constitutional right if a negro baby be bear and this be true also of puerto ricans and mexicans in some of our city he have about one half as much chance to get through high school as a white baby he have one third as much chance to get through college as a white student he have about a third as much chance to be a professional man about half as much chance to own a house he have about uh four time as much chance that he will be out of work in his life as the white baby i think we can do well i do not want the talent of any american to go to waste i know that there be those who want to turn everything over to the government i do not at all i want the individual to meet their responsibility and i want the state to meet their responsibility but i think there be also a national responsibility the argument have be use against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty five year the people of the united states individually could not have develop the tennessee valley collectively they could have a cotton farmer in georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in wisconsin and minnesota he can not protect himself against the force of supply and demand in the market place but work together in effective governmental program he can do so seventeen million americans who live over sixty five on an average social security check of about seventy eight dollar a month they be not able to sustain themselves individually but they can sustain themselves through the social security system i do not believe in big government but i believe in effective governmental action and i think that be the only way that the united states be go to maintain its freedom it be the only way that we be go to move ahead i think we can do a well job i think we be go to have to do a well job if we be go to meet the responsibility which time and event have place upon we we can not turn the job over to anyone else if the united states fail then the whole cause of freedom fail and i think it depend in great measure on what we do here in this country the reason franklin roosevelt be a good neighbor in latin america be because he be a good neighbor in the united states because they feel that the american society be move again i want we to recapture that image i want people in latin america and africa and asia to start to look to america to see how we be do thing to wonder what the resident of the united states be do and not to look at khrushchev or look at the chinese communists that be the obligation upon our generation in 1933 franklin roosevelt say in his inaugural that this generation of americans have a rendezvous with destiny i think our generation of americans have the same rendezvous the question now be can freedom be maintain under the most severe tack attack it have ever know i think it can be and i think in the final analysis it depend upon what we do here i think it be time america start move again

 mr smith and now the opening statement by vice president richard m. nixon

 mr nixon mr. smith senator kennedy the thing that senator kennedy have say many of we can agree with there be no question but that we can not discuss our internal affair in the united states without recognize that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position there be no question but that this nation can not stand still because we be in a deadly competition a competition not only with the man in the kremlin but the man in peking we be ahead in this competition as senator kennedy i think have imply but when you be in a race the only way to stay ahead be to move ahead and i subscribe completely to the spirit that senator kennedy have express tonight the spirit that the united states should move ahead where then do we disagree i think we disagree on the implication of his remark tonight and on the statement that he have make on many occasion during his campaign to the effect that the united states have be stand still we hear tonight for example the statement make that our growth in national product last year be the low of any industrial nation in the world now last year of course be 1958 that happen to be a recession year but when we look at the growth of g.n.p. this year a year of recovery we find that it be six and nine tenth per cent and one of the high in the world today more about that later look then to this problem of how the united states should move ahead and where the united states be move i think it be well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner let us look at the record be the united states stand still be it true that this administration as senator kennedy have charge have be an administration of retreat of defeat of stagnation be it true that as far as this country be concern in the field of electric power in all of the field that he have mention we have not be move ahead well we have a comparison that we can make we have the record of the truman administration of seven and a half year and the seven and a half year of the eisenhower administration when we compare these two record in the area that senator kennedy have have discuss tonight i think we find that america have be move ahead let us take school we have build more school in these last seven and a half year than we build in the previous seven and a half for that matter in the previous twenty year let us take hydroelectric power we have develop more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half year than be develop in any previous administration in history let we take hospital we find that more have be build in this administration than in the previous administration the same be true of highway let us put it in term that all of we can understand we often hear gross national product discuss and in that respect may i say that when we compare the growth in this administration with that of the previous administration that then there be a total growth of eleven percent over seven year in this administration there have be a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven year that show that there be be more growth in this administration than in its predecessor but let us not put it there let us put it in term of the average family what have happen to you we find that your wage have go up five time as much in the eisenhower administration as they do in the truman administration what about the price you pay we find that the price you pay go up five time as much in the truman administration as they do in the eisenhower administration what be the net result of this this mean that the average family income go up fifteen per cent in the eisenhower year as against two per cent in the truman year now this be not stand still but good as this record be may i emphasize it be not enough a record be never something to stand on it be something to build on and in build on this record i believe that we have the secret for progress we know the way to progress and i think first of all our own record prove that we know the way senator kennedy have suggest that he believe he know the way i respect the sincerity which he m- which he make that suggestion but on the other hand when we look at the various program that he offer they do not seem to be new they seem to be simply retread of the program of the truman administration which precede it and i would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those area in which his program be new where they will mean more progress than we have then what kind of program be we for we be for program that will expand educational opportunity that will give to all americans their equal chance for education for all of the thing which be necessary and dear to the heart of our people we be for program in addition which will see that our medical care for the aged be be be much be much well handle than it be at the present time here again may i indicate that senator kennedy and i be not in disagreement as to the aim we both want to help the old people we want to see that they do have adequate medical care the question be the mean i think that the mean that i advocate will reach that goal well than the mean that he advocate i could give well example but for for whatever it be whether it be in the field of housing or health or medical care or school or the eh- development of electric power we have program which we believe will move america move she forward and build on the wonderful record that we have make over these past seven and a half year now when we look at these program might i suggest that in evaluate they we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program be how much you be spend i will concede that in all the area to which i have refer senator kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than i would have it spend i cost out the cost of the democratic platform it run a minimum of thirteen and two tenth billion dollar a year more than we be presently spend to a maximum of eighteen billion dollar a year more than we be presently spend now the republican platform will cost more too it will cost a minimum of four billion dollar a year more a maximum of four and nine tenth billion dollar a year more than we be presently spend now do this mean that his program be well than our not at all because it be not a question of how much the federal government spend it be not a question of which government do the most it be a question of which administration do the right thing and in our case i do believe that our program will stimulate the creative energy of a hundred and eighty million free americans i believe the program that senator kennedy advocate will have a tendency to stifle those creative energy i believe in other word that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress the final point that i would like to make be this senator kennedy have suggest in his speech that we lack compassion for the poor for the old and for other that be unfortunate let we understand throughout this campaign that his motive and mine be sincere i know what it mean to be poor i know what it mean to see people who be unemployed i know senator kennedy feel as deeply about these problem as i do but our disagreement be not about the goal for america but only about the mean to reach those goal

 mr smith thank you mr. nixon that complete the opening statement and now the candidate will answer question or comment upon one another 's answer to question put by correspondent of the network the correspondent introduce themselves i be sander vanocur nbc news i be charles warren mutual news i be stuart novins cbs news bob fleming abc news the first question to senator kennedy from mr. fleming

 mr fleming senator the vice president in his campaign have say that you be naive and at time immature he have raise the question of leadership on this issue why do you think people should vote for you rather than the vice president

 mr kennedy well the vice president and i come to the congress together 1946 we both serve in the labor committee i have be there now for fourteen year the same period of time that he have so that our experience in uh government be comparable secondly i think the question be uh what be the program that we advocate what be the party record that we lead i come out of the democratic party which in this century have produce woodrow wilson and franklin roosevelt and harry truman and which support and sustain these program which i have discuss tonight mr. nixon come out of the republican party he be nominate by it and it be a fact that through most of these last twenty five year the republican leadership have oppose federal aid for education medical care for the aged development of the tennessee valley development of our natural resource i think mr. nixon be an effective leader of his party i hope he would grant i the same the question before we be which point of view and which party do we want to lead the united states

 mr smith mr. nixon would you like to comment on that statement

 mr. nixon i have no comment

 mr. smith the next question mr. novins

 mr novins mr. vice president your campaign stress the value of your eight year experience and the question arise as to whether that experience be as an observer or as a participant or as an initiator of policy making would you tell we please specifically what major proposal you have make in the last eight year that have be adopt by the administration

 mr nixon it would be rather difficult to cover they in eight and- in two and a half minute i would suggest that these proposal could be mention first after each of my foreign trip i have make recommendation that have be adopt for example after my first trip abroad abroad i strongly recommend that we increase our exchange program particularly as they relate to exchange of person of leader in the labor field and in the information field after my trip to south america i make recommendation that a separate inter american lending agency be set up which the south american nation would like much well than a lend- than to participate in the lending agency which treat all the country of the world the same uh i have make other recommendation after each of the other trip for example after my trip abroad to hungary i make some recommendation with regard to the hungarian refugee situation which be adopt not only by the president but some of they be enact into law by the congress within the administration as a chairman of the president 's committee on price stability and economic growth i have have the opportunity to make recommendation which have be adopt within the administration and which i think have be reasonably effective i know senator kennedy suggest in his speech at cleveland yesterday that that committee have not be particularly effective i would only suggest that while we do not take the credit for it i would not presume to that since that committee have be form the price line have be hold very well within the united states

 mr kennedy well i would say in the latter that the and that be what i find uh somewhat unsatisfactory about the figure uh mr. nixon that you use in your previous speech when you talk about the truman administration you mr. truman come to office in nineteen uh forty four and at the end of the war and uh difficulty that be face the united states during that period of transition 1946 when price control be lift so it be rather difficult to use an overall figure take those seven and a half year and compare they to the last eight year i prefer to take the overall percentage record of the last twenty year of the democrats and the eight year of the republicans to show an overall period of growth in regard to uh price stability uh i be not aware that that committee do produce recommendation that ever be certainly before the congress from the point of view of legislation in regard to control price in regard to the exchange of student and labor union i be chairman of the subcommittee on africa and i think that one of the most unfortunate phase of our policy towards that country be the very minute number of exchange that we have i think it be true of latin america also we do come forward with a program of student for the congo of over three hundred which be more than the federal government have for all of africa the previous year so that i do not think that uh we have move at least in those two area with sufficient vigor

 mr smith the next question to senator kennedy from mr. warren

 mr warren uh senator kennedy during your brief speech a few minute ago you mention farm surplus

 mr kennedy that be correct

 mr warren i would like to ask this it be a fact i think that presidential candidate traditionally make promise to farmer lot of people i think do not understand why the government pay farmer for not produce certain crop or pay farmer if they overproduce for that matter now let i ask sir why can not the farmer operate like the business man who operate a factory if an auto company overproduce a certain model car uncle sam do not step in and buy up the surplus why this constant courting of the farmer

 mr kennedy well because i think that if the federal government move out of the program and withdraw its support uh then i think you would have complete uh economic chaos the farmer plant in the spring and harvest in the fall there be hundred of thousand of they they really do not they be not able to control their market very well they bring their crop in or their livestock in many of they about the same time they have only a few purchaser that buy their milk or their hog a few large company in many case and therefore the farmer be not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place i think the experience of the twenty have show what a free market could do to agriculture and if the agricultural economy collapse then the economy of the rest of the united states soon or later will collapse the farmer be the number one market for the automobile industry of the united states the automobile industry be the number one market for steel so if the farmer economy continue to decline as sharply as it have in recent year then i think you would have a recession in the rest of the country so i think the case for the government intervention be a good one secondly my objection to present farm policy be that there be no effective control to bring supply and demand into well balance the dropping of the support price in order to limit production do not work and we now have the high uh surplus nine billion dollar worth we have have a uh high tax load from the treasury for the farmer in the last few year with the low farm income in many year i think that this farm policy have fail in my judgment the only policy that will work will be for effective supply and demand to be in balance and that can only be do through governmental action i therefore suggest that in those basic commodity which be support that the federal government after endorsement by the farmer in that commodity attempt to bring supply and demand into balance attempt effective production control so that we will not have that five or six per cent surplus which break the price fifteen or twenty per cent i think mr. benson 's program have fail and i must say after read the vice president 's speech before the farmer as he read mine i do not believe that it be very much different from mr. benson 's i do not think it provide effective governmental control i think the support price be tie to the average market price of the last three year which be mr. benson 's theory i therefore do not believe that this be a sharp enough breach with the past to give we any hope of success for the future

 mr smith mr. nixon comment

 mr nixon i of course disagree with senator kennedy insofar as his suggestion as to what should be do uh with re- on the farm program he have make the suggestion that what we need be to move in the direction of more government control a suggestion that would also mean raise price uh that the consumer pay for product and im- and impose upon the farmer uh control on acreage even far more than they have today i think this be the wrong direction i do not think this have work in the past i do not think it will work in the future the program that i have advocate be one which depart from the present program that we have in this respect it recognize that the government have a responsibility to get the farmer out of the trouble he presently be in because the government get he into it and that be the fundamental reason why we can not let the farmer go by himself at the present time the farmer produce these surplus because the government ask he to through legislation during the war now that we have these surplus it be our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh the surplus until we get the surplus off the farmer 's back however we should have a program such as i announce which will see that farm income hold up but i would propose hold that income up not through a type of program that senator kennedy have suggest that would raise price but one that would indemnify the farmer pay the farmer in kind uh from the product which be in surplus

 mr. smith the next question to vice president nixon from mr. vanocur

 mr vanocur uh mr. vice president since the question of executive leadership be a very important campaign issue i would like to follow mr. novins question now republican campaign slogan you will see they on sign around the country as you do last week say it be experience that count that be over a picture of yourself sir uh imply that you have have more governmental executive decision make uh experience than uh your opponent now in his news conference on august twenty fourth president eisenhower be ask to give one example of a major idea of yours that he adopt his reply be and i be quote if you give i a week i might think of one i do not remember now that be a month ago sir and the president have not bring it up since and i be wonder sir if you can clarify which version be correct the one put out by republican campaign leader or the one put out by president eisenhower

 mr nixon well i would suggest mr. vanocur that uh if you know the president that be probably a facetious remark uh i would also suggest that insofar as his statement be concern that i think it would be improper for the president of the united states to disclose uh the instance in which member of his official family have make recommendation as i have make they through the year to he which he have accept or reject the president have always maintain and very properly so that he be entitle to get what advice he want from his cabinet and from his other adviser without disclose that to anybody include as a matter of fact the congress now i can only say this through the year i have sit in the national security council i have be in the cabinet i have meet with the legislative leader i have meet with the president when he make the great decision with regard to lebanon quemoy and matsu other matter the president have ask for my advice i have give it sometimes my advice have be take sometimes it have not i do not say that i have make the decision and i would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decision the president only make the decision all that his adviser do be to give counsel when he ask for it as far as what experience count and whether that be experience that count that be not for i to say uh i can only say that my experience be there for the people to consider senator kennedy 's be there for the people to consider as he point out we come to the congress in the same year his experience have be different from mine mine have be in the executive branch his have be in the legislative branch i would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and i think both he and i be go to abide by whatever the people decide

 mr smith senator kennedy

 mr. kennedy well i will just say that the question be of experience and the question also be uh what our judgment be of the future and what our goal be for the united states and what ability we have to implement those goal abraham lincoln come to the presidency in 1860 after a rather little know uh session in the house of representatives and after be defeat for the senate in fifty eight and be a distinguished president there be no certain road to the presidency there be no guarantee that uh if you take uh one road or another that you will be a successful president i have be in the congress for fourteen year i have vote in the last uh eight year uh and the vice president be uh preside over the senate and meet his other responsibility i have met meet uh decision over eight hundred time on matter which affect not only the domestic security of the united states but as a member of the senate foreign relations committee the question really be which candidate and which party can meet the problem that the united states be go to face in the sixty

 mr smith the next question to senator kennedy from mr. novins

 mr novins senator kennedy in connection with these problem of the future that you speak of and the program that you enunciate early in your direct talk you call for expand some of the welfare program for school for teacher salary medical care and so forth but you also call for reduce the federal debt and i be wonder how you if you be president in january would go about pay the bill for all this do this mean that you

 mr kennedy i do not indicate i do not advocate reduce the federal debt because i do not believe that you be go to be able to reduce the federal debt very much in nineteen sixty one two or three i think you have heavy obligation which affect our security which we be go to have to meet and therefore i have never suggest we should uh be able to retire the debt substantially or even at all in nineteen sixty one or two

 mr novins senator i believe in in one of your speech

 mr kennedy no never

 mr novins you suggest that reduce the interest rate would help toward

 mr kennedy no no not reduce the interest

 mr novins a reduction of the federal debt

 mr kennedy reduce the interest rate in my judgment the hard money tight money policy fiscal policy of this administration have contribute to the slow down in our economy which help bring the recession of fifty four which make the recession of fifty eight rather intense and which have slow somewhat our economic activity in 1960 what i have talk about however the kind of program that i have talk about in my judgment be uh fiscally sound medical care for the aged i would put under social security the vice president and i disagree on this the program the javits nixon or the nixon javits program would have cost if fully use uh six hundred million dollar by the government per year and six hundred million dollar by the state the program which i advocate which fail by five vote in the united states senate would have put medical care for the aged in social security and would have be pay for through the social security system and the social security tax secondly i support federal aid to education and federal aid for teacher salary i think that be a good investment i think we be go to have to do it and i think to heap the burden far on the property tax which be already strain in many of our community will provide will make sh- insure in my opinion that many of our child will not be adequately educate and many of our teacher not adequately compensate there be no great return to an economy or to a society than an educational system second to none on the question of the development of natural resource i would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balance and the power revenue would bring back sufficient money to finance the project in the same way as the tennessee valley i believe in the balanced budget and the only condition under which i would unbalance the budget would be if there be a grave national emergency or a serious recession otherwise with a steady rate of economic growth and mr. nixon and mr. rockefeller in their meeting say a five per cent economic growth would bring by 1962 ten billion dollar extra in tax revenue whatever be bring in i think that we can finance essential program within a balanced budget if business remain orderly

 mr smith mr. nixon your comment

 mr nixon yes i think what mr. novins be refer to be not one of senator kennedy 's speech but the democratic platform which do mention cut the national debt i think too that it should be point out that of course it be not possible particularly under the proposal that senator kennedy have advocate either to cut the national debt or to reduce taxis as a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxis as senator kennedy point out that as far as his one proposal be concern the one for medical care for the aged that that would be finance out of social security that however be raise taxis for those who pay social security he point out that he would make pay as you go be the basis for our natural resource development where our natural resource development which i also support incidentally however whenever you uh uh in in uh appropriate money for one of these project you have to pay now and appropriate the money and the eh- while they eventually do pay out it do not mean that you the government do not have to put out the money this year and so i would say that in all of these proposal senator kennedy have make they will result in one of two thing either he have to raise taxis or he have to unbalance the budget if he unbalance the budget that mean you have inflation and that will be of course a very cruel blow to the very people the old people that we have be talk about as far as aid for school construction be concern i favor that as senator kennedy do in january of this year when he say he favor that rather than aid to s- teacher salary i favor that because i believe that be the good way to aid our school without run any risk whatever of the federal government tell our teacher what to teach

 mr smith the next question to vice president nixon from mr. warren

 mr warren mr. vice president you mention school and it be just yesterday i think you ask for a crash program to raise education standard and this evening you talk about advance in education mr. vice president you say it be back in 1957 that salary pay to school teacher be nothing short of a national disgrace high salary for teacher you add be important and if the situation be not correct it could lead to a national disaster and yet you refuse to vote in the senate in order to break a tie vote when that single vote if it have be yes would have grant salary increase to teacher i wonder if you could explain that sir

 mr nixon i be awfully glad you ge- get that question because as you know i get into it at the last of my other question and be not able to complete the argument uh i think that the reason that i vote against have the federal government uh pay teacher salary be probably the very reason that concern senator kennedy when in january of this year in his kick off press conference he say that he favor aid for school construction but at that time do not feel that there should be aid for teacher salary at least that be the way i read his remark now why should there be any question about the federal government aid s- teacher salary why do senator kennedy take that position then why do i take it now we both take it then and i take it now for this reason we want high teacher salary we need high teacher salary but we also want our education to be free of federal control when the federal government get the power to pay teacher inevitably in my opinion it will acquire the power to set standard and to tell the teacher what to teach i think this would be bad for the country i think it would be bad for the teaching profession there be another point that should be make i favor high salary for teacher but as senator kennedy say in january of this year in this same press conference the way that you get high salary for teacher be to support school construction which mean that all of the local school district in the various state then have money which be free to raise the standard for teacher salary i should also point out this once you put the responsibility on the federal government for pay a portion of teacher salary your local community and your state be not go to meet the responsibility as much as they should i believe in other word that we have see the local community and the state assume more of that responsibility teacher salary very fortunately have go up fifty percent in the last eight year as against only a thirty four percent rise for other salary this be not enough it should be more but i do not believe that the way to get more salary for teacher be to have the federal government get in with a massive program my objection here be not the cost in dollar my objection here be the potential cost in control and eventual freedom for the american people by give the federal government power over education and that be the great power a government can have

 mr smith senator kennedy 's comment

 mr kennedy when uh the vice president quote i in january sixty i do not believe the federal government should pay directly teacher salary but that be not the issue before the senate in february the issue before the senate be that the money would be give to the state the state then could determine whether the money would be spend for school construction or teacher salary on that question the vice president and i disagree i vote in favor of that proposal and support it strongly because i think that that provide assistance to our teacher for their salary without any chance of federal control and it be on that vote that th- mr. nixon and i disagree and his tie vote uh defeat his break the tie defeat the proposal i do not want the federal government pay teacher salary directly but if the money will go to the state and the state can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teacher salary in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee and therefore i think that be a sound proposal and that be why i support it and i regret that it do not pass secondly there have be statement make that uh the democratic platform would cost a good deal of money and that i be in favor of unbalance the budget that be wholly wrong wholly in error and it be a fact that in the last eight year the democratic congress have reduce the appropri- the request for the appropriation by over ten billion dollar that be not my view and i think it ought to be state very clearly on the record my view be that you can do these program and they should be carefully draw within a balanced budget if our economy be move ahead

 mr smith the next question to senator kennedy from mr. vanocur

 mr vanocur senator you have be promise the voter that if you be elect president you will try and push through congress bill on medical aid to the aged a comprehensive minimum hourly wage bill federal aid to education now in the august post convention session of the congress when you at least hold up the possibility you could one day be president and when you have overwhelming majority especially in the senate you could not get action on these bill now how do you feel that you will be able to get they in january

 mr kennedy well as you take the bill

 mr vanocur if you be not able to get they in august

 mr kennedy if i may take the bill we do pass in the senate a bill uh to provide a dollar twenty five cent minimum wage it fail because the house do not pass it and the house fail by eleven vote and i might say that two third of the republicans in the house vote against a dollar twenty five cent minimum wage and a majority of the democrats sustain it nearly two third of they vote for the dollar twenty five we be threaten by a veto if we pass a dollar and a quarter it be extremely difficult with the great power that the president do to pass any bill when the president be oppose to it all the president need to sustain his veto of any bill be one third plus one in either the house or the senate secondly we pass a federal aid to education bill in the senate it fail to come to the floor of the house of representatives it be kill in the rules committee and it be a fact in the august session that the four member of the rules committee who be republicans join with two democrats vote against send the aid to education bill to the floor of the house four democrats vote for it every republican on the rules committee vote against send that bill to be consider by the member of the house of representatives thirdly on medical care for the aged this be the same fight that be be go on for twenty five year in social security we want to tie it to social security we offer an amendment to do so forty four democrats vote for it one republican vote for it and we be inform at the time it come to a vote that if it be adopt the president of the united states would veto it in my judgment a vigorous democratic president support by a democratic majority in the house and senate can win the support for these program but if you send a republican president and a democratic majority and the threat of a veto hang over the congress in my judgment you will continue what happen in the august session which be a clash of party and inaction

 mr smith mr. nixon comment

 mr nixon well obviously my view be a little different first of all i do not see how it be possible for a one third of a body such as the republicans have in the house and the senate to stop two third if the two third be adequately lead i would say too that when senator kennedy refer to the action of the house rules committee there be eight democrats on that committee and four republicans it would seem to i again that it be very difficult to blame the four republicans for the eight democrats not get a something through that particular committee i would say far that to blame the president in his veto power for the inability of the senator and his colleague to get action in this special session uh miss the mark when the president exercise his veto power he have to have the people upo- behind he not just a third of the congress because let us consider it if the majority of the member of the congress feel that these particular proposal be good issue the majority of those who be democrats why do not they pass they and send to the president and get a veto and have an issue the reason why these particular bill in these various field that have be mention be not pass be not because the president be against they it be because the people be against they it be because they be too extreme and i be convinced that the alternate proposal that i have that the republicans have in the field of health in the field of education in the field of welfare because they be not extreme because they will accomplish the end uh without too great cost in dollar or in freedom that they could get through the next congress

 mr smith the next question to vice president nixon fa- from mr. fleming

 mr fleming mr. vice president do i take it then you believe that you can work well with democratic majority in the house and senate than senator kennedy could work with democratic majority in the house and senate

 mr nixon i would say this that we of course expect to pick up some seat in both in the house and the senate uh we would hope to control the house to get a majority in the house uh in this election we can not of course control the senate i would say that a president will be able to lead a president will be able to get his program through to the effect that he have the support of the country the support of the people sometimes we we get the opinion that in get program through the house or the senate it be purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing it be not really that whenever a majority of the people be for a program the house and the senate respond to it and whether this house and senate in the next session be democratic or republican if the country will have vote for the candidate for the presidency and for the proposal that he have make i believe that you will find that the president if it be a republican as it would be in my case would be able to get his program through that congress now i also say that as far as senator kennedy 's proposal be concern that again the question be not simply one of uh a presidential veto stop program you must always remember that a president can not stop anything unless he have the people behind he and the reason president eisenhower 's veto have be sustain the reason the congress do not send up bill to he which they think will be veto be because the people and the congress the majority of they know the country be behind the president

 mr smith senator kennedy

 mr kennedy well now let us look at these bill that the vice president suggest be too extreme one be a bill for a dollar twenty five cent an hour for anyone who work in a store or company that have a million dollar a year business i do not think that be extreme at all and yet nearly two third to three fourth of the republicans in the house of representatives vote against that proposal secondly be the federal aid to education bill it it be a very uh because of the defeat of teacher salary it be not a bill that uh meet in my opinion the need the fact of the matter be it be a bill that be less than you recommend mr. nixon this morning in your proposal it be not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one republican to join at least i think four of the eight democrats vote to send it to the floor of the house not one republican and they join with those democrats who be oppose to it i do not say the democrats be unite in their support of the program but i do say a majority be and i say a majority of the republicans be oppose to it the third be medical care for the aged which be tie to social security which be finance out of social security fund it do not put a deficit on the treasury the proposal advance by you and by mr. javits would have cost six hundred million of dollar mr. rockefeller reject it in new york say he do not agree with the financing at all say it ought to be on social security so these be three program which be quite moderate i think it show the difference between the two party one party be ready to move in these program the other party give they lip service

 mr smith mr. warren 's question for senator kennedy

 mr warren senator kennedy on another subject communism be so often describe as an ideology or a belief that exist somewhere other than in the united states let i ask you sir just how serious a threat to our national security be these communist subversive activity in the united states today

 mr kennedy well i think they be serious i think it be a matter that we should continue to uh give uh great care and attention to we should support uh the law which the united states have pass in order to protect we from uh those who would destroy we from within we should sustain uh the department of justice in its effort and the f.b.i. and we should be continually alert i think if the united states be maintain a strong society here in the united states i think that we can meet any internal threat the major threat be external and will continue

 mr smith mr. nixon comment

 mr nixon i agree with senator kennedy 's appraisal generally in this respect the question of communism within the united states have be one that have worry we in the past it be one that will continue to be a problem for year to come we have to remember that the cold war that mr. khrushchev be wage and his colleague be wage be wage all over the world and it be wage right here in the united states that be why we have to continue to be alert it be also essential in be alert that we be fair fair because by be fair we uphold the very freedom that the communists would destroy we uphold the standard of conduct which they would never follow and in this connection i think that uh we must look to the future have in mind the fact that we fight communism at home not only by our law to deal with communists uh the few who do become communists and the few who do become tra- fellow traveler but we also fight communism at home by move against those various injustice which exist in our society which the communists feed upon and in that connection i again would say that while senator kennedy say we be for the status quo i do believe that he uh would agree that i be just as sincere in believe that my proposal for federal aid to education my proposal for health care be just as sincerely hold as his the question again be not one of goal we be for those goal it be one of mean

 mr smith mr. vanocur 's question for vice president nixon

 mr vanocur mr. vice president uh in one of your early statement you say we have move ahead we have build more school we have build more hospital now sir be not it true that the building of more school be a local matter for financing uh be you claim that the eisenhower administration be responsible for the building of these school or be it the local school district that provide for it

 mr nixon not at all as a matter of fact your question bring out a point that i be very glad to make too often in appraise whether we be move ahead or not we think only of what the federal government be do now that be not the test of whether america move the test of whether america move be whether the federal government plus the state government plus the local government plus the big segment of all individual enterprise move we have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollar roughly a hundred billion to a hundred and a quarter billion of that be the result of government activity four hundred billion approximately be a result of what individual do now the reason the eisenhower administration have move the reason that we have have the fund for example locally to build the school and the hospital and the highway to make the progress that we have be because this administration have encourage individual enterprise and it have result in the great expansion of the private sector of the economy that have ever be witness in an eight year period and that be growth that be the growth that we be look for it be the growth that this administration have support and that its policy have stimulate

 mr smith senator kennedy

 mr kennedy well i must say that the reason that the school have be construct be because the local school district be willing to increase the property taxis to a tremendously high figure in my opinion almost to the point of diminish return in order to sustain these school secondly i think we have a rich uh country and i think we have a powerful country i think what we have to do however be have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade if we be go to maintain our security in education in economic growth in development of natural resource the soviet union be make great gain it be not enough to compare what might have be do eight year ago or ten year ago or fifteen year ago or twenty year ago i want to compare what we be do with what our adversary be do so that by the year 1970 the united states be ahead in education in health in building in home in economic strength i think that be the big assignment the big task the big function of the federal government

 mr smith can i have the summation time please we have complete our question and our comment and in just a moment we will have the summation time

 voice this will allow three minute and twenty second for the summation by each candidate

 mr sm1th three minute and twenty second for each candidate vice president nixon will you make the first summation

 mr nixon thank you mr. smith senator kennedy first of all i think it be well to put in perspective where we really do stand with regard to the soviet union in this whole matter of growth the soviet union have be move fast than we have but the reason for that be obvious they start from a much low base although they have be move fast in growth than we have we find for example today that their total gross national product be only forty four per cent of our total gross national product that be the same percentage that it be twenty year ago and as far as the absolute gap be concern we find that the united states be even far ahead than it be twenty year ago be this any reason for complacency not at all because these be determined man they be fanatical man and we have to get the very most of uh out uh out of our economy i agree with senator kennedy completely on that score where we disagree be in the mean that we would use to get the most out of our economy i respectfully submit that senator kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government on what it would do to solve our problem to stimulate growth i believe that when we examine the democratic platform when we examine the proposal that he have discuss tonight when we compare they with the proposal that i have make that these proposal that he make would not result in great growth for this country than would be the case if we follow the program that i have advocate there be many of the point that he have make that i would like to comment upon the one in the field of health be worth mention our health program the one that senator javits and other republican senators as well as i support be one that provide for all people over sixty five who want health insurance the opportunity to have it if they want it it provide a choice of have either government insurance or private insurance but it compel nobody to have insurance who do not want it his program under social security would require everybody who have social security to take government health insurance whether he want it or not and it would not cover several million people who be not cover by social security at all here be one place where i think that our program do a well job than his the other point that i would make be this this downgrading of how much thing cost i think many of our people will understand well when they look at what happen when during the truman administration when the government be spend more than it take in we find saving over a lifetime eat up by inflation we find the people who could least afford it people on retire income uh people on fix income we find they unable to meet their bill at the end of the month it be essential that a man who be president of this country certainly stand for every program that will mean for growth and i stand for program that will mean growth and progress but it be also essential that he not allow a dollar spend that could be well spend by the people themselves

 mr smith senator kennedy your conclusion

 mr kennedy the point be make by mr. nixon that the soviet production be only forty four percent of ours i must say that forty four percent and that soviet country be cause we a good deal of trouble tonight i want to make sure that it stay in that relationship i do not want to see the day when it be sixty percent of ours and seventy and seventy five and eighty and ninety percent of ours with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction secondly the vice president mention medical care for the aged our program be an amendment to the kerr bill the kerr bill provide assistance to all those who be not on social security i think it be a very clear contrast in 1935 when the social security act be write ninety four out of ninety five republicans vote against it mr. landon run in 1936 to repeal it in august of 1960 when we try to get it again but this time for medical care we receive the support of one republican in the senate on this occasion thirdly i think the question before the american people be as they look at this country and as they look at the world around they the goal be the same for all americans the mean be at question the mean be at issue if you feel that everything that be be do now be satisfactory that the relative power and prestige and strength of the united states be increase in relation to that of the communists that we have b- gain more security that we be achieve everything as a nation that we should achieve that we be achieve a well life for our citizen and great strength then i agree i think you should vote for mr. nixon but if you feel that we have to move again in the sixty that the function of the president be to set before the people the unfinished business of our society as franklin roosevelt do in the thirty the agenda for our people what we must do as a society to meet our need in this country and protect our security and help the cause of freedom as i say at the beginning the question before we all that face all republicans and all democrats be can freedom in the next generation conquer or be the communists go to be successful that be the great issue and if we meet our responsibility i think freedom will conquer if we fail if we fail to move ahead if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country then i think that uh the tide could begin to run against we and i do not want historian ten year from now to say these be the year when the tide run out for the united states i want they to say these be the year when the tide come in these be the year when the united states start to move again that be the question before the american people and only you can decide what you want what you want this country to be what you want to do with the future i think we be ready to move and it be to that great task if we be successful that we will address ourselves

 mr smith thank you very much gentleman this hour have go by all too quickly thank you very much for permit we to present the next president of the united states on this unique program i have be ask by the candidate to thank the american network and the affiliate station for provide time and facility for this joint appearance other debate in this series will be announce later and will be on different subject this be howard k. smith good night from chicago

 mr niven mr. vice president senator kennedy say last night that the administration must take responsibility for the loss of cuba would you compare the validity of that statement with the validity of your own statement in previous campaign that the truman administration be responsible for the loss of china to the communists

 mr nixon well first of all i do not agree with senator kennedy that cuba be lose and certainly china be lose when this administration come into power in 1953 as i look at cuba today i believe that we be follow the right course a course which be difficult but a course which under the circumstance be the only proper one which will see that the cuban people get a chance to realize their aspiration of progress through freedom and that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi- of the state in the organization of american states now senator kennedy have make some very strong criticism of my part or allege part in what have happen in cuba he point to the fact that i visit cuba while mr. batista be in power there i can only point out that if we be go to judge the administrations in term of our attitude toward dictator we be glad to have a comparison with the previous administration there be eleven dictator in south america and in central america when we come in in 1953 today there be only three left include the one in cuba we think that be pretty good progress senator kennedy also indicate with regard to cuba that he think that i have make a mistake when i be in cuba in not call for free election in that country now i be very surprised that senator kennedy who be on the foreign relations committee would have make such a statement as this kind as a matter of fact in his book the strategy for peace he take the right position and that position be that the united states have a treaty a treaty with all of the organization of american states which prohibit we from interfere in the internal affair of any other state and prohibit they as well for i to have make such a statement would be in direct uh opposition to that treaty now with regard to cuba let i make one thing clear there be not any question but that we will defend our right there there be not any question but that we will defend guantanamo if it be attack there also be not any question but that the free people of cuba the people who want to be free be go to be support and that they will attain their freedom no cuba be not lose and i do not think this kind of defeatist talk by senator kennedy help the situation one bit

 mr mcgee senator kennedy would you care to comment

 mr kennedy in the first place i have never suggest that cuba be lose except for the present in my speech last night i indicate that i think that cuba one day again would be free where i have be critical of the administration 's policy and where i criticize mr. nixon be because in his press conference in havana in 1955 he praise the competence and stability of the bicta- bict- batista dictatorship that dictatorship have kill over twenty thousand cubans in seven year secondly i do not criticize he for not call for free election what i criticize be the failure of the administration to use its great influence to persuade the cuban government to hold free election particularly in 1957 and 1958 thirdly arthur gardner a republican ambassador earl smith a republican ambassador in succession both have indicate in the past six week that they report to washington that castro be a marxist that raul castro be a communist and that they get no effective result instead our aid continue to batista which be ineffective we never be on the side of freedom we never use our influence when we could have use it most effectively and today cuba be lose for freedom i hope some day it will rise but i do not think it will rise if we continue the same policy toward cuba that we do in recent year and in fact towards all of latin america when we have almost ignore the need of latin america we have beam not a single voice of america program in spanish to all of latin america in the last eight year except for the three month of the hungarian uh revolution

 mr mcgee mr. morgan with a question for senator kennedy

 mr morgan senator last may in oregon you discuss the possibility of send apology or regret to khrushchev over the u-2 incident do you think now that that would have do any good do you think so then

 mr kennedy mr. morgan i suggest that if the united states feel that it could save the summit conference that it would have be proper for we to have express regret in my judgment that statement have be distort uh by mr. nixon and other in their debate around the country and in their discussion mr. lodge on meet the press a month ago say if there be ever a case when we do not have law an our side it be in the u-2 incident the u-2 flight be proper from the point of view of protect our security but they be not in accordance with international law and i say that i feel that rather than tell the lie which we tell rather than indicate that the flight would continue in fact i believe mr. nixon himself say on may fifteenth that the flight would continue even though mr. herter testify before the senate foreign relations committee that they have be cancel as of may twelfth that it would have be far well that if we have express regret if that would have save the summit and if the summit be useful and i believe it be the point that be always leave out be the fact that we express regret to castro this winter that we express regret the eisenhower administration express regret for a flight over southern russia in 1958 we express regret for a flight over eastern germany under this administration the soviet union in 1955 express regret to we over the bering sea incident the chinese communists express regret to we over a plane incident in 1956 that be the accept procedure between nation and my judgment be that we should follow the advice of theodore roosevelt be strong maintain a strong position but also speak softly i believe that in those case where international custom call for the expression of a regret if that would have keep the summit go in my judgment it be a proper action it be not appeasement it be not soft i believe we should be strong than we now be i believe we should have a strong military force i believe we should increase our strength all over the world but i do not confuse word with strength and in my judgment if the summit be useful if it would have bring we close to peace that rather than the lie that we tell which have be criticize by all responsible people afterwards it would have be far well for we to follow the common diplomatic procedure of express regret and then try to move on

 mr mcgee mr. vice president

 mr nixon i think kenne- senator kennedy be wrong on three count first of all he be wrong in think th- er- even suggest that mr. khrushchev might have continue the conference if we have express regret he know these flight be go on long before and that be not the reason that he break up the conference second he be wrong in the analogy that he make the united states be a strong country whenever we do anything that be wrong we can express regret but when the president of the united states be do something that be right something that be for the purpose of defend the security of this country against surprise attack he can never express regret or apologize to anybody include mr. khrushchev now in that connection senator kennedy have criticize the president on the ground not only of not express regret but because he allow this flight to take place while the summit conference or immediately before the summit conference occur this seem to i be criticism that again be wrong on his part we all remember pearl harbor we lose three thousand american life we can not afford an intelligence gap and i just want to make my position absolutely clear with regard to get intelligence information i do not intend to see to it that the united states be ever in a position where while we be negotiate with the soviet union that we discontinue our intelligence effort and i do not intend ever to express regret to mr. khrushchev or anybody else if i be do something that have the support of the congress and that be right for the purpose of protect the security of the united states

 mr mcgee mr. spivak with a question for vice president nixon

 mr spivak mr. vice president you have accuse senator kennedy of avoid the civil right issue when he have be in the south and he have accuse you of the same thing with both north and south listening and watching would you sum up uh your own intention in the field of civil right if you become president

 mr nixon my intention in the field of civil right have be spell out in the republican platform i think we have to make progress first in the field of employment and there we would give statutory authority to the committee on government contracts which be an effective way of get real progress make in this area since about one out of every four job be hold by and be allot by people who have government contract certainly i think all of we agree that when anybody have a government contract certainly the money that be spend under that contract ought to be disburse equally without regard to the race or creed or color of the individual who be to be employ second in the field of school we believe that there should be provision whereby the federal government would give assistance to those district who do want to integrate their school that of course be reject as be the government contract provision by the special session of the congress to in which mr. kennedy be quite active and then as far as other area be concern i think that we have to look to presidential leadership and when i speak of presidential leadership i refer for example to our attitude on the sit in strike here we have a situation which cause all of we concern cause we concern because of the denial of the right of people to the equality which we think belong to everybody i have talk to negro mother i have hear they explain try to explain how they tell their child how they can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but then can not go into that store and sit at the counter and get a coca cola this be wrong and we have to do something about it so under the circumstance what do we do well what we do be what the attorney general of the united states do under the direction of the president call in the owner of chain store and get they to take action now there be other place where the executive can lead but let i just sum up by say this why do i talk every time i be in the south on civil right not because i be preach to the people of the south because this be not just a southern problem it be a northern problem and a western problem it be a problem for all of we i do it because it be the responsibility of leadership i do it because we have to solve this problem together i do it right at this time particularly because when we have khrushchev in this country a man who have enslave million a man who have slaughter thousand we can not continue to have a situation where he can point the finger at the united states of america and say that we be deny right to our citizen and so i say both the candidate and both the vice presidential candidate i would hope as well include senator johnson should talk on this issue at every opportunity

 mr mcgee senator kennedy

 mr kennedy well mr. nixon have not discuss the two basic question what be go to be do and what will be his policy on implement the supreme court decision of 1954 give aid to school technically that be try to carry out the decision be not the great question secondly what be he go to do to provide fair employment he be be the head of the committee on government contracts that be carry out two case both in the district of columbia he have not indicate his support of an attempt to provide fair employment practice around the country so that everyone can get a job regardless of their race or color nor have he indicate that he will support title three which would give the attorney general additional power to protect constitutional right these be the great question equality of education in school about two percent of our population of white people be be illiterate ten per cent of our colored population sixty to seventy percent of our colored child do not finish high school these be the question in these area that the north and south east and west be entitle to know what will be the leadership of the president in these area to provide equality of opportunity for employment equality of opportunity in the field of housing which could be do on all federal support housing by a stroke of the president 's pen what will be do to provide equality of education in all section of the united states those be the question to which the president must establish a moral tone and moral leadership and i can assure you that if i be elect president we will do so

 mr mcgee mr. levy with a question for senator kennedy

 mr levy senator on the same subject in the past you have emphasize the president 's responsibility as a moral leader as well as an executive on civil right question what specifically might the next president do uh in the event of an uh an occurrence such as little rock or the lunch counter sit in from the standpoint of mr kennedy well let i say that i think that the president operate in a number of different area first as a legislative leader and as i just say that i believe that the passage of the so call title three which give the attorney general the power to protect constitutional right in those case where it be not possible for the person involve to bring the suit secondly as an executive leader there have be only six case bring by this attorney general under the voting bill pass in 1957 and the voting bill pass in 1960 the right to vote be basic i do not believe that this administration have implement those bill which represent the will of the majority of the congress on two occasion with vigor thirdly i do not believe that the government contract division be operate with vigor everyone who do business with the government should have the opportunity to make sure that they do not practice discrimination in their hiring and that be in all section of the united states and then fourthly as a moral leader there be a very strong moral basis for this concept of equality of opportunity we be in a very difficult time we need all the talent we can get we sit on a conspicuous stage we be a goldfish bowl before the world we have to practice what we preach we set a very high standard for ourselves the communists do not they set a low standard of materialism we preach in the declaration of independence and in the constitution in the statement of our great leader we preach very high standard and if we be not go to be s- charge before the world with hypocrisy we have to meet those standard i believe the president of the united states should indicate it now lastly i believe in the case of little rock i would have hope that the president of the united states would have be possible for he to indicate it clearly that uh the supreme court decision be go to be carry out i would have hope that it would have be possible to use marshal to do so but it wou- uh evidently uh under the handling of the case it be not i would hope an incident like that would not happen i think if the president be responsible if he consult with those involve if he make it clear that the supreme court decision be go to be carry out in a way that the supreme court plan with deliberate speed then in my judgment provide he be behind action i believe we can make uh progress now the present administration the president have say never indicate what he think of the 1954 decision unless the president speak then of course uh the country do not speak and franklin roosevelt say the pre uh the presidency of the united states be above all a place of moral leadership and i believe on this great moral issue he should speak out and give his view clearly

 mr mcgee mr. vice president

 mr nixon senator kennedy have express some hope in this field hope which i think all americans would share who want some problem some progress in this area but let us look at the performance when he select his vice presidential running mate he select a man who have vote against most of these proposal and who oppose they at the present time let i s- look also at what i do i select a man who stand with i in this field and who will talk with i and work with i on it now the senator refer to the committee on government contracts and yet that very committee of which i be chairman have be handicap by the fact that we have not have adequate fund we have not have adequate power we have not have an adequate staff now in the special session of congress and also in the session that precede it the democratic congress in which there be a two to one democratic majority be ask by the president to give we the fund and give we the power to do a job and they do nothing at all and in the special session in which senator kennedy be call the signal along with senator johnson they turn it down and he himself vote against give we the power despite the fact that the bill have already be consider before that it already have hearing on and the congress already know what it have before it all that i can say be this what we need here be not just high hope what we need be action and in the field of executive leadership i can say that i believe it be essential that the president of the united states not only set the tone but he also must lead he must act as he talk

 mr mcgee mr. morgan with a question for vice president nixon

 mr morgan mr. vice president in your speech you emphasize that the united states be do basically well in the cold war can you square that statement with a considerable mass of bipartisan report and study include one prominently participate in by governor rockefeller which almost unanimously conclude that we be not do nearly so well as we should

 mr nixon mr. morgan no matter how well we be do in the cold war we be not do as well as we should and that will always be the case as long as the communists be on the international scene in the aggressive tac- uh tendency that they presently be follow now as far as the present situation be concern i think it be time that we nail a few of these distortion about the united states that have be put out first of all we hear that our prestige be at an all time low senator kennedy have be hit that point over and over again i would suggest that after premier kush- khrushchev 's uh performance in the united nations compare with president eisenhower 's eloquent speech that at the present time communist prestige in the world be at an all time low and american prestige be at an all time high now that of course be just one factor but it be a significant one when we look for example at the vote on the congo we be on one side they be on the other side what happen there be seventy vote for our position and none for theirs look at the vote in the united nations over the past seven and a half year that be a test of prestige every time the united states have be an one side and they have be on the other side our position have be sustain now look to what we ought to do in the future in this cold war we have to recognize where it be be fight and then we have to develop program to deal with it it be be fight primarily in asia in africa and in latin america what do we need what tool do we need to fight we well we need for example economic assistance we need technical assistance we need exchange we need program of diplomatic and other character which will be effective in that area now senator kennedy a moment ago refer to the fact that there be not an adequate voice of america program for latin america i would like to point out that in the last six year the democratic congresses of which he have be a member have cut twenty million dollar off of the voice of america program they also have cut four billion dollar off of mutual security in these last six year they also have cut two billion dollar off of defense now when they talk about our record here it be well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well so let i summarize by say this i be not satisfied with what we be do in the cold war because i believe we have to step up our activity and launch an offensive for the mind and heart and soul of man it must be economic it must be technological above all it must be ideological but we have get to get help from the congress in order to do this

 mr mcgee senator kennedy

 mr kennedy of course mr. nixon be wholly inaccurate when he say that the congress have not provide more fund in fact than the president recommend for national defense nineteen fifty three we try to put an appropriation of five billion dollar for our defense i be responsible for the amendment with senator monroney in 1954 to strengthen our ground force the congress of the united states appropriate six hundred and seventy seven million dollar mare than the president be willing to use up till a week ago secondly on the question of our position in the united nations we all know about the vote hold this week of the five neutralist and it be generally regard as a defeat for the united states thirdly in 1952 there be only seven vote in favor of the admission of red china into the united nations last year there be twenty nine and tomorrow when the preliminary vote be hold you will see a strengthening of that position or very closely to it we have not maintain our position and our prestige a gallup poll take in february of this year ask the in eight out of nine country they ask the people who do they think would be ahead by 1970 militarily and scientifically and a majority in eight of the nine country say the soviet union would be by 1970 governor rockefeller have be far more critical in june of our position in the world than i have be the rockefeller brothers report general ridgway general gavin the gaither report various report of congressional committee all indicate that the relative strength of the p- united states both militarily politically psychologically and scientifically and industrially the relative strength of the so- of united states compare to that of the soviet union and the chinese communists together have deteriorate in the last eight year and we should know it and the american people should be tell the fact

 mr mcgee mr. spivak with a question for senator kennedy

 mr spivak senator uh follow this up how would you go about increase the prestige you say we be lose and could the program you have devise to do so be accomplish without absolutely wreck our economy

 mr kennedy yes we have be wholly indifferent to latin america until the last few month the program that be put forward this summer after we break off the sugar quota with cuba really be do because we want to get through the o.a.s. meeting a condemnation of russian infiltration of cuba and therefore we pass an authorization not an aid bill which be the first time really since the inter american bank which be found a year ago be develop that we really have look at the need of latin america that we have associate ourselves with those people secondly i believe that in the ca- that it be far well for the united states instead of concentrate our aid particularly in the underdeveloped world on surplus military equipment we pour three hundred million dollar of surplus military equipment into laos we pay more military aid more aid into laos po- per per person than in any country in the world and we ought to know now that laos be move from neutralism in the direction of the communists i believe instead of do that we should concentrate our aid in long term loan which these people can pay back either in hard money or in local currency this permit they to maintain their self respect it permit we to make sure that the project which be invest in be go to produce great wealth and i believe that in case of india and africa and latin america that this be where our emphasis should be i would strengthen the development loan fund and senator fulbright senator humphrey and i try to do that we try to provide an appropriation of a billion and a half for five year on a long term loan basis which this administration oppose and unless we be ready to carry out program like that in the sixty this battle for economic survival which these people be wage be go to be lose and if india should lose her battle with thirty five per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her border then i believe that the balance of power could move against we i think the united states can afford to do these thing i think that we could not afford not to do these thing this go to our survival and here in a country which if it be move ahead if it be develop its economy to the full which we be not now in my judgment we will have the resource to meet our military commitment and also our commitment overseas i believe it be essential that we do it because in the next ten year the balance of power be go to begin to move in the world from one direction or another towards we or towards the communists and unless we begin to identify ourselves not only with the anti communist fight but also with the fight against poverty and hunger these people be go to begin to turn to the communists as an example i believe we can do it if we build our economy the way we should we can afford to do these thing and we must do it

 mr mcgee mr. vice president

 mr nixon senator kennedy have put a great deal of stress on the necessity for economic assistance this be important but it be also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pour in technical assistance at w- as well that you have a disastrous situation we need to step up exchange we need to step up technical assistance so that train people in these newly develop country can operate the economy we also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world and that be that as america move forward we not only must think in term of fight communism but we must also think primarily in term of the interest of these country we must associate ourselves with their aspiration we must let they know that the great american ideal of independence of the right of people to be free and of the right to progress that these be ideal that belong not to ourselves alone but they belong to everybody this we must get across to the world and we can not do it unless we do have adequate fund for for example information which have be cut by the congress adequate fund for technical assistance the other point that i would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance be that the united states must not rest its case here alone this be primarily an ideological battle a battle for the mind and the heart and the soul of man we must not meet the communists purely in the field of gross atheistic materialism we must stand for our ideal

 mr mcgee mr. levy with a question for vice president nixon

 mr levy mr. vice president the labor department today add five more major industrial center to the list of area with substantial unemployment you say in new york this week that as president you would use the full power of the government if necessary to combat unemployment specifically what measure would you advocate and at what point

 mr nixon to combat unemployment we first must concentrate on the very area to which you refer the so call depressed area now in the last congress the special session of the congress there be a bill one by the president one by senator kennedy and member of his party now the bill that the president have submit would have provide more aid for those area that really need it area like scranton and wilkes barre and the area of west virginia than the one that senator kennedy be support on the other hand we find that the bill get into the legislative difficulty and consequently no action be take so point one at the high priority we must get a bill for depressed area through the next congress i have make recommendation on that and i have discuss they previously and i will spell they out far in the campaign second as we consider this problem of unemployment we have to realize where it be in analyze the figure we will find that our unemployment exist among the old citizen it exist also among those who be inadequately train that is those who do not have an adequate opportunity for education it also exist among minority group if we be go to combat unemployment then we have to do a well job in these area that be why i have a program for education a program in the case of equal job opportunity and one that would also deal with our old citizen now finally with regard to the whole problem of combat recession as you call it we must use the full resource of the government in these respect one we must see to it that credit be expand as we go into any recessionary period and understand i do not believe we be go into a recession i believe this economy be sound and that we be go to move up but second in addition to that if we do get into a recessionary period we should move on that part of the economy which be represent by the private sector and i mean stimulate that part of the economy that can create job the private sector of the economy this mean through tax reform and if necessary tax cut that will stimulate more job i favor that rather than massive federal spending program which will come into effect usually long after you have pass through the recessionary period so we must use all of these weapon for the purpose of combat recession if it should come but i do not expect it to come

 mr mcgee senator kennedy

 mr kennedy well mr. nixon have state the record inaccurately in regard to the depressed area bill i be very familiar with it it come out of the committee of which i be the chairman the labor subcommittee in fifty five i be the floor manager we pass an area redevelopment bill far more effective than the bill the administration suggest on two occasion and the president veto it both time we pass a bill again this year in the cong- in the senate and it die in the rules committee of the house of representatives let i make it very clear that the bill that mr. nixon talk about do not mention wilkes barre or scranton it do not mention west virginia our bill be far more effective the bill introduce and erd- sponsor by senator douglas be far more effective in try to stimulate the economy of those area secondly he have mention the problem of our old citizen i can not still understand why this administration and mr. nixon oppose put medical care for the aged under social security to give they some security third i believe we should step up the use of our surplus food in these area until we be able to get the people back to work five cent a day that be what the food package average per person fourthly i believe we should not carry out a hard money high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958 and i think helped bring the slow down of 1960 if we move into a recession in sixty one then i would agree that we have to put more money into the economy and it can be do by either one of the two method discuss one be by ex- the program such as aid to education the other would be to make a judgment on what be the most effective tax program to stimulate our economy

 mr mcgee mr. niven with a question for senator kennedy

 mr niven senator while the main theme of your campaign have be this decline of american power and prestige in the last eight year you have hardly criticize president eisenhower at all and in a speech last weekend you say you have no quarrel with the president now be not mr. eisenhower and not mr. nixon responsible for any such decline

 mr kennedy well i understand that this be the eisenhower nixon administration accord to all the republican uh propaganda that i have read the question be what we be go to do in the future i have be critical of this administration and i have be critical of the president in fact uh mr. nixon uh discuss that a week ago in a speech i believe that our power and prestige in the last eight year have decline now what be the issue be what we be go to do in the future now that be an issue between mr. nixon and myself he feel that we be move ahead uh in a we be not go into a recession in this country economically he feel that our power and prestige be strong than it ever be relative to that of the communists that we be move ahead i disagree and i believe the american people have to make the choice on november eighth between the view of whether we have to move ahead fast whether what we be do now be not satisfactory whether we have to build great strength at home and abroad and mr. nixon 's view that be the great issue president eisenhower move from the scene on january twentieth and the next four year be the critical year and that be the debate that be the argument between mr. nixon and myself and on that issue the american people have to make their judgment and i think it be a important judgment i think in many way this election be more important than any since 1932 or certainly almost any in this century because we disagree very fundamentally on the position of the united states and if his view prevail then i think that be go to bring an important result to this country in the sixty if our view prevail that we have to do more that we have to make a great national and international effort that we have lose prestige in latin america the president of brazil the new incumbent run for office call on castro during his campaign because he think it be important to get the vote of those who be support castro in latin america in africa the united states have ignore latin uh africa we give more scholarship to the congo this summer we offer they than we have give to all of africa the year before less than two hundred for all the country of africa and they need train leadership more than anything we have be uh have a very clear decision in the last eight year mr. nixon have be part of that administration he be have experience in it and i believe this administration have not meet its responsibility in the last eight year that our power relative to that of the communists be decline that we be face a very hazardous time in the sixty and unless the united states begin to move here unless we start to go ahead i do not believe that we be go to meet our responsibility to our own people or to the cause of freedom i think the choice be clear and it involve the future

 mr mcgee mr. vice president

 mr nixon well first of all i think senator kennedy should make up his mind with regard to my responsibility in our first debate he indicate that i have not have experience or at least uh have not participate significantly in the making of the decision i be glad to hear tonight that he do suggest that i have have some experience let i make my position cl ear i have participate in the discussion lead to the decision in this administration i be proud of the record of this administration i do not stand on it because it be not something to stand on but something to build on now look at senator kennedy 's credential he be suggest that he will move america fast and far than i will but what do he offer he offer retread of program that fail i submit to you that as you look at his program his program for example with regard to the federal reserve and uh free money or loose money uh high low interest rate his program in the economic field generally be the program that be adopt and try during the truman administration and when we compare the economic progress of this country in the truman administration with that of the eisenhower administration we find that in every index there have be a tr- great deal more performance and more progress in this administration than in that one i say the program and the leadership that fail then be not the program and the leadership that america need now i say that the american people do not want to go back to those policy and incidentally if senator kennedy disagree he should indicate where he believe those policy be different from those he be advocate today

 mr mcgee mr. spivak with a question for vice president nixon

 mr spivak mr. vice president accord to news dispatch soviet premier khrushchev say today that prime minister macmillan have assure he that there would be a summit conference next year after the presidential election have you give any cause for such assurance and do you consider it desirable or even possible that there would be a summit conference next year if mr. khrushchev persist in the condition he be lay down

 mr nixon no of course i have not talk to prime minister macmillan it would not be appropriate for i to do so the president be still go to be president for the next four month and he of course be the only one who could commit this country in this period as far as a summit conference be concern i want to make my position absolutely clear i would be willing as president to meet with mr. khrushchev or any other world leader if it would serve the cause of peace i would not be able wou- would be willing to meet with he however unless there be preparation for that conference which would give we some reasonable certainty some reasonable certainty that you be go to have some success we must not build up the hope of the world and then dash they as be the case in paris there mr. khrushchev come to that conference determine to break it up he be go to break it up because he would know that he be not go to get his way on berlin and on the other key matter with which he be concern at the paris conference now if we be go to have another summit conference there must be negotiation at the diplomatic level the ambassador the secretaries of state and other at that level prior to that time which will delineate the issue and which will prepare the way for the head of state to meet and make some progress otherwise if we find the head of state meeting and not make progress we will find that the cause of peace will have be hurt rather than help so under these circumstance i therefore strongly urge and i will strongly hold if i have the opportunity to urge or to hold this position that any summit conference would be go into only after the most careful preparation and only after mr. khrushchev after his disgraceful conduct at paris after his disgraceful conduct at the united nations give some assurance that he really want to sit down and talk and to accomplish something and not just to make propaganda

 mr mcgee senator kennedy

 mr kennedy i have no disagreement with the vice president 's position on that it my view be the same as his let i say there be only one uh point i would add that before we go into the summit before we ever meet again i think it be important that the united states build its strength that it build its military strength as well as its own economic strength if we negotiate from a position where the power balance or wave be move away from we it be extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on berlin as well as the other question now the next president of the united states in his first year be go to be confront with a very serious question on our defense of berlin our commitment to berlin it be go to be a test of our nerve and will it be go to be a test of our strength and because we be go to move in sixty one and two partly because we have not maintain our strength with sufficient vigor in the last year i believe that before we meet that crisis that the next president of the united states should send a message to congress ask for a revitalization of our military strength because come spring or late in the winter we be go to be face to face with the most serious berlin crisis since l949 or fifty on the question of the summit i agree with the position of mr. nixon i would not meet mr. khrushchev unless there be some agreement at the secondary level foreign minister or ambassador which would indicate that the meeting would have some hope of success or a useful exchange of idea

 mr mcgee mr. levy with a question for senator kennedy

 mr levy senator in your acceptance speech at los angeles you say that your campaign would be base not on what you intend to offer the american people but what you intend to ask of they since that time you have spell out many of the thing that you intend to do but you have make only vague reference to sacrifice and self denial a year or so ago i believe you say that you would not hesitate to recommend a tax increase if you consider it necessary

 mr kennedy that be right

 mr levy be this what you have in mind

 mr kennedy well i do not think that in the winter of sixty one under present economic condition it uh a uh tax uh increase would be desirable in fact it would be deflationary it would cause great unemployment it would cause a real slowdown in our economy if it ever become necessary and be wise economically and essential to our security i would have no hesitancy in suggest a tax increase or any other policy which would defend the united states i have talk in every speech about the fact that these be go to be very difficult time in the nineteen sixty and that we be go to have to meet our responsibility as citizen i be talk about a national mood i be talk about our willingness to bear any burden in order to maintain our own freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe we do not know what the future be go to bring but i would not want anyone to elect i uh president of the united states or vote for i under the expectation that life would be easy if i be elect now many of the program that i be talk about economic growth care for the aged development of our natural resource build the strength of the united states that be how the united states begin to prepare for its great action in world war ii and in the post war period if we be move ahead if we be provide a viable economy if our people have sufficient resource so that they can consume what we produce then this country be on the move then we be strong then we set a well example to the world so we have the problem of not only build our own uh military strength and extend uh our policy abroad we have to do a job here at home so i believe that the policy that i recommend come under the general heading of strengthen the united states we be use our steel capacity fifty five per cent today we be not able to consume what we be able to produce at a time when the soviet union be make great economic gain and all i say be i do not know what the sixty will bring except i think they will bring hard time in the uh international sphere i hope we can move ahead here at home in the united states i be confident we can do a far well job of mobilize our economy and resource in the united states and i merely say that they if they elect i president i will do my good to carry the united states through a difficult period but i would not want people to elect i because i promise they the easy soft life i think it be go to be difficult but i be confident that this country can meet its responsibility

 mr mcgee mr. vice president

 mr nixon well i think we should be no under no illusion whatever about what the responsibility of the american people will be in the sixty our expenditure for defense our expenditure for mutual security our expenditure for economic assistance and technical assistance be not go to get less in my opinion they be go to be de- be great i think it may be necessary that we have more taxis i hope not i hope we can economize elsewhere so that we do not have to but i would have no hesitation to ask the american people to pay the taxis even in l961 if necessary to maintain a sound economy and also to maintain a sound dollar because when you do not tax and tax enough to pay for your outgo you pay it many time over in high price and inflation and i simply will not do that i think i should also add that as far as senator kennedy 's proposal be concern if he intend to carry out his platform the one adopt in los angeles it be just impossible for he to make good on those promise without raise taxis or without have a rise in t- price or both the platform suggest that it can be do through economic growth that it can be do in effect with mirror but it be not go to be work that way you can not add billion of dollar to our expenditure and not pay for it after all it be not pay for by my money it be not pay for by his but by the people 's money

 mr mcgee mr. niven with a question for vice president nixon

 mr niven mr. vice president you say that while mr. khrushchev be here senator kennedy should talk about what be right with this country as well as what be wrong with the country in the 1952 campaign when you be republican candidate for vice president and we be eh at war with the communists do you feel a similar responsibility to t- talk about what be right with the country

 mr nixon i do and as i point out in 1952 i make it very clear that as far as the korean war be concern that i feel that the decision to go into the war in korea be right and necessary what i criticize be the policy that make it necessary to go to korea now incidentally i should point out here that senator kennedy have attack our foreign policy he be say that it be be a policy that have lead to defeat and retreat and i would like to know where have we be defeat and where have we retreat in the truman administration six hundred million people go behind the iron curtain include the satellite country of eastern europe and communist china in this administration we have stop they at quemoy and matsu we have stop they in indochina we have stop they in lebanon we have stop they in other part of the world i would also like to point out that as far as senator kennedy 's comment be concern i think he have a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this administration whenever he think we be wrong but he have a responsibility to be accurate and not to misstate the case i do not think he should say that our prestige be at an all time low i think this be very harmful at a time mr. khrushchev be here harmful because it be wrong i do not think it be helpful when he suggest and i be glad he be correct this to an extent that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night in the united states now this just be not true now there be people who go to bed hungry in the united states far less incidentally than use to go to bed hungry when we come into power at the end of the truman administration but the thing that be right about the united states it should be emphasize be that less people go to bed hungry in the united states than in any major country in the world we be the good feed we be the well clothe with a well distribution of this world 's good to all of our people than any people in history now in point out the thing that be wrong i think we ought to emphasize america 's strength it be not necessary to to run america down in order to build she up now so that we get it absolutely clear senator kennedy must as a candidate as i as a candidate in fifty two criticize we when we be wrong and he be do a very effective job of that in his way but on the other hand he have a responsibility to be accurate and i have a responsibility to correct he every time he misstate the case and i intend to continue to do so

 mr mcgee senator kennedy

 mr kennedy well mr. nixon uh- i will just give you the testimony of mr. george aiken senator george aiken the rank minority member republican member and former chairman of the senate agricultural committee testify in 1959 say there be twenty six million americans who do not have the income to afford a decent diet mr. benson testify on the food stamp plan in 1957 say there be twenty five million americans who could not afford a elementary low cost diet and he define that as someone who use bean in place of meat now i have see a good many hundred of thousand of people who be uh not adequately feed you can not tell i that a surplus food distribution of five cent po- per person and that n- nearly six million americans receive that be adequate you can not tell i that any one who use bean instead of meat in the united states and there be twenty five million of they accord to mr. benson be well feed or adequately feed i believe that we should not compare what our figure may be to india or some other country that have serious problem but to remember that we be the most prosperous country in the world and that these people be not get adequate food and they be not get in many case adequate shelter and we ought to try to meet the problem secondly mr. nixon have continue to state and he state it last week these fantastic figure of what the democratic budget would c- uh platform would cost they be wholly inaccurate i say last week i believe in a balanced budget unless there be a severe recession and after all the worst unbalanced budget in history be in 1958 twelve billion dollar large than in any administration in the history of the united states so that i believe that on this subject we can balance the budget unless we have a national emergency or unless we have a severe recession

 mr mcgee mr. morgan with a question for senator kennedy

 mr morgan senator saturday on television you say that you have always think that quemoy and matsu be unwise place to draw our defense line in the far east would you comment far on that and also address to this question could not a pullback from those island be interpret as appeasement

 mr kennedy well the united states uh have on occasion attempt uh mostly in the middle fifty to persuade chiang kai shek to pull his troop back to formosa i believe strongly in the defense of formosa these island be a few mile five or six mile off the coast of red china within a general harbor area and more than a hundred mile from formosa we have never say flatly that we will defend quemoy and matsu if it be attack we say we will defend it if it be part of a general attack on formosa but it be extremely difficult to make that judgment now mr. herter in 1958 when he be under secretary of state say they be strategically undefensible admiral spruance and callins in 1955 say that we should not attempt to defend these island in their conference in the far east general ridgway have say the same thing i believe that when you get into a w- if you be go to get into war for the defense of formosa it ought to be on a clearly define line one of the problem i think at the time of south korea be the question of whether the united states would defend it if it be attack i believe that we should defend formosa we should come to its defense to leave this rather in the air that we will defend it under some condition but not under other i think be a mistake secondly i would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the communist gun it be a decision finally that the nationalists should make and i believe that we should consult with they and attempt to work out a plan by which the line be draw at the island of formosa it leave a hundred mile between the sea but with general ridgway mr. herter general collins admiral spruance and many other i think it be unwise to take the chance of be drag into a war which may lead to a world war over two island which be not strategically defensible which be not accord to their testimony essential to the defense of formosa i think that uh we should protect our commitment i believe strongly we should do so in berlin i believe strongly we should d- do so in formosa and i believe we should meet our commitment to every country whose security we have guarantee but i do not believe that that line in case of war should be draw on those island but instead on the island of formosa and as long as they be not essential to the defense of formosa it be be my judgment ever since 1954 at the time of the eisenhower doctrine for the far east that our line should be draw in the sea around the island itself

 mr mcgee mr. vice president

 mr nixon i disagree completely with senator kennedy on this point i remember in the period immediately before the korean war south korea be suppose to be indefensible as well general testify to that and secretary acheson make a very famous speech at the press club early in the year that k- korean war start indicate in effect that south korea be beyond the defense zone of the united states i suppose it be hope when he make that speech that we would not get into a war but it do not mean that we have to go in when they come in now i think as far as quemoy and matsu be concern that the question be not these two little piece of real estate they be unimportant it be not the few people who live on they they be not too important it be the principle involve these two island be in the area of freedom the nationalists have these two island we should not uh force our nationalist ally to get off of they and give they to the communists if we do that we start a chain reaction because the communists be not after quemoy and matsu they be a- they be after formosa in my opinion this be the same kind of woolly think that lead to disaster for america in korea i be against it i would never tolerate it as president of the united states and i will hope that senator kennedy will change his mind if he should be elect

 mr mcgee gentleman we have approximately four minute remain may i ask you to make your question and answer as brief as possible consistent with clarity and mr. levy have a question for vice president nixon

 mr levy mr. vice president you be urge voter to forget party label and vote for the man senator kennedy say that in do this you be try to run away from your party on such issue as housing and aid to education by advocate what he call a me too program why do you say that party label be not important

 mr nixon because that be the way we elect a president in this country and it be the way we should i be a student of history as be senator kennedy incidentally and i have find that in the history of this country we have have many great president some of they have be democrats and some of they have be republicans the people some way have always understand that at a particular time a certain man be the one the country need now i believe that in an election when we be try to determine who should lead the free world not just america perhaps as senator kennedy have already indicate the most important election in our history it be not the label that he wear or that i wear that count it be what we be it be our whole life it be what we stand for it be what we believe and consequently i do not think it be enough to go before republican audience and i never do and say look vote for i because i be a republican i do not think it be enough for senator kennedy to go before the audience on the democratic side and say vote for i because i be a democrat that be not enough what be involve here be the question of leadership for the whole free world now that mean the good leadership it may be republican it may be democratic but the people be the one that determine it the people have to make up their mind and i believe the people therefore should be ask to make up their mind not simply on the basis of vote the way your grandfather do vote the way your mother do i think the people should put america first rather than party first now as far as run away from my party be concern senator kennedy have say that we have no compassion for the poor that we be against progress the enemy of progress be the term that he be use and the like all that i can say be this we do have program in all of these field education housing defense that will move america forward they will move she forward fast and they will move she more surely than in his program this be what i deeply believe i be sure he believe just as deeply that his will move that way i suggest however that in the interest of fairness that he could give i the benefit of also believe as he believe

 mr mcgee senator kennedy

 mr kennedy well let i say i do think that party be important in that they tell something about the program and something about the man abraham lincoln be a great president of all the people but he be select by his party at a key time in history because his party stand for something the democratic party in this century have stand for something it have stand for progress it have stand for concern for the people 's welfare it have stand for a strong foreign policy and a strong national defense and as a result produce wilson president roosevelt and president truman the republican party have produce mckinley and harding coolidge dewey and landon they do stand for something they stand for a whole different approach to the problem face this country at home and abroad that be the importance of party only if it tell something about the record and the republicans in recent year not only in the last twenty five year but in the last eight year have oppose housing oppose care for the aged oppose federal aid to education oppose minimum wage and i think that record tell something

 mr mcgee senator kennedy yesterday you use the word trigger happy in refer to vice president richard nixon 's stand on defend the island of quemoy and matsu last week on a program like this one you say the next president would come face to face with a serious crisis in berlin so the question be would you take military action to defend berlin

 mr kennedy mr. mcgee we have a contractual right to be in berlin come out of the conversation at potsdam and of world war ii that have be reinforce by direct commitment of the president of the united states it be be reinforce by a number of other nation under nato i have state on many occasion that the united states must meet its commitment on berlin it be a commitment that we have to meet if we be go to protect the security of western europe and therefore on this question i do not think that there be any doubt in the mind of any american i hope there be not any doubt in the mind of any member of the community of west berlin i be sure there be not any doubt in the mind of the russians we will meet our commitment to maintain the freedom and independence of west berlin

 mr shadel mr. vice president do you wish to comment

 mr nixon yes as a matter of fact the statement that senator kennedy make be that to the effect that there be trigger happy republicans that my stand on quemoy and matsu be an indication of trigger happy republicans i resent that comment i resent it because th- it be an implication that republicans have be trigger happy and therefore would lead this nation into war i would remind senator kennedy of the past fifty year i would ask he to name one republican president who lead this nation into war there be three democratic president who lead we into war i do not mean by that that one party be a war party and the other party be a peace party but i do say that any statement to the effect that the republican party be trigger happy be belie by the record we have a war when we come into power in 1953 we get rid of that we have keep out of other war and certainly that do not indicate that we be trigger happy we have be strong but we have not be trigger happy as far as berlin be concern there be not any question about the necessity of defend berlin the right of people there to be free and there be not any question about what the united american people republicans and democrats alike would do in the event there be an attempt by the communists to take over berlin

 mr shadel the next question be by mr. von fremd for vice president nixon

 mr von fremd mr. vice president a two part question concern the offshore island in the formosa straits if you be president and the chinese communists tomorrow begin an invasion of quemoy and matsu would you launch the uh united states into a war by send the seventh fleet and other military force to resist this aggression and secondly if the uh regular conventional force fail to halt such uh such an invasion would you authorize the use of nuclear weapon

 mr nixon mr. von fremd it would be completely irresponsible for a candidate for the presidency or for a president himself to indicate the course of action and the weapon he would use in the event of such an attack i will say this in the event that such an attack occur and in the event the attack be a prelude to an attack on formosa which would be the indication today because the chinese communists say over and over again that their objective be not the offshore island that they consider they only steppingstone to take formosa in the event that their attack then be a prelude to an attack on formosa there be not any question but that the united states would then again as in the case of berlin honor our treaty obligation and stand by our ally of formosa but to indicate in advance how we would respond to indicate the nature of this response would be incorrect it would certainly be inappropriate it would not be in the good interest of the united states i will only say this however in addition to do what senator kennedy have suggest to suggest that we will surrender these island or force our chinese nationalist ally to surrender they in advance be not something that would lead to peace it be something that would lead in my opinion to war this be the history of deal with dictator this be something that senator kennedy and all americans must know we try this with hitler it do not work he want first uh we know austria and then he go on to the sudetenland and then danzig and each time it be think this be all that he want now what do the chinese communists want they do not want just quemoy and matsu they do not want just formosa they want the world and the question be if you surrender or indicate in advance that you be not go to defend any part of the free world and you figure that be go to satisfy they it do not satisfy they it only whet their appetite and then the question come when do you stop they i have often hear president eisenhower in discuss this question make the statement that if we once start the process of indicate that this point or that point be not the place to stop those who threaten the peace and freedom of the world where do we stop they and i say that those of we who stand against surrender of territory this or any other in the face of blackmail in the s- face of force by the communists be stand for the course that will lead to peace

 mr shadel senator kennedy do you wish to comment

 mr kennedy yes the whole th- the united states now have a treaty which i vote for in the united states senate in 1955 to defend formosa and the pescadores island the island which mr. nixon be discuss be five or four mile respectively off the coast of china now when senator green the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee write to the president he receive back on the second of october 1958 neither you nor any other american need feel the u.s. will be involve in military hostility merely in the defense of quemoy and matsu now that be the issue i believe we must meet our commitment to uh formosa i support it and the pescadores island that be the present american position the treaty do not include these two island mr. nixon suggest uh that the united states should go to war if these two island be attack i suggest that if formosa be attack or the pescadores or if there be any military action in any area which indicate an attack on formosa and the pescadores then of course the united states be at war to defend its treaty now i must say what mr. nixon want to do be commit we as i understand he so that we can be clear if there be a disagreement he want we to be commit to the defense of these island merely as the defense of these island as free territory not as part of the defense of formosa admiral yarnell the commander of the asiatic fleet have say that these island be not worth the bone of a single american the president of the united states have indicate they be not within the treaty area they be not within the treaty area when the treaty be pass in fifty five we have attempt to persuade chiang kai shek as late as january of 1959 to reduce the number of troop he have on they this be a serious issue and i think we ought to understand completely if we disagree and if so where

 mr shadel mr. cater have the next question for senator kennedy

 mr cater senator kennedy last week you say that before we should hold another summit conference that it be important that the united states build its strength modern weapon take quite a long time to build what sort of prolonged period do you envisage before there can be a summit conference and do you think that there can be any new initiative on the ground of nuclear disarmament uh nuclear control or weapon control d- uh during this period

 mr kennedy well i think we should st- strengthen our conventional force and we should attempt in january february and march of next year to increase the airlift capacity of our conventional force then i believe that we should move full time on our missile production particularly on minuteman and on polaris it may be a long period but we must we must get start immediately now on the question of disarmament particularly nuclear disarmament i must say that i feel that another effort should be make by a new administration in january of 1961 to renew negotiation with the soviet union and see whether it be possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chance of contamination of the atmosphere and also lessen the chance that other power will begin to possess a nuclear capacity there be indication because of new invention that ten fifteen or twenty nation will have a nuclear capacity include red china by the end of the presidential office in 1964 this be extremely serious there have be many war in the history of mankind and to take a chance uh now be and not make every effort that we could make to provide for some control over these weapon i think would be a great mistake one of my disagreement with the present administration have be that i do not feel a real effort have be make an this very sensitive subject not only of nuclear control but also of general disarmament less than a hundred people have be work throughout the entire federal government on this subject and i believe it be be reflect in our success and failure at geneva now we may not succeed the soviet union may not agree to an inspection system we may be able to get satisfactory assurance it may be necessary for we to begin test again but i hope the next administration and if i have anything to do with it the next administration will make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing control of nuclear weapon if possible control of outer space free from weapon and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament level these must be do if we can not succeed then we must strengthen ourselves but i would make the effort because i think the fate not only of our own civilization but i think the fate of world and the future of the human race be involve in prevent a nuclear war

 mr shadel mr. vice president your comment

 mr nixon yes i be go to make a major speech on this whole subject next week before the next debate and i will have an opportunity then to answer any other question that may arise with regard to my position on it there be not any question but that we must move forward in every possible way to reduce the danger of war to move toward control disarmament to control test but also let us have in mind this when senator kennedy suggest that we have not be make an effort he simply do not know what he be talk about it be not a question of the number of people who be work in an administration it be a question of who they be this have be one of the high level operation in the whole state department right under the president himself we have go certainly the extra mile and then some in make offer to the soviet union on control of test on disarmament and in every other way and i just want to make one thing very clear yes we should make a great effort but under no circumstance must the united states ever make an agreement base on trust there must be an absolute guarantee now just a comment on senator kennedy 's last answer he forget that in this same debate on the formosa resolution which he say he vote for which he do that he vote against an amendment or be record against an amendment and on this particular or for an amendment i should say which pass the senate overwhelmingly seventy to twelve and that amendment put the senate of the united states on record with a majority of the senator 's own party voting for it as well as the majority of republicans put they on record against the very position that the senator take now of surrendering of indicate in advance that the united states will not defend the offshore island

 mr shadel the next question be by mr. drummond for vice president nixon

 mr drummond mr. nixon i would like to ask eh one more aspect or raise another aspect of this same question uh it be my understanding that president eisenhower never advocate that quemoy and matsu should be defend under all circumstance as a matter of principle i hear secretary dulles at a press conference in fifty eight say that he think that it be a mistake for chiang kai shek to deploy troop to these island i would like to ask what have lead you to take what appear to be a different position on this subject

 mr nixon well mr. drummond first of all refer to secretary dulles press conference i think if you read it all and i know that you have you will find that secretary dulles also indicate in that press conference that when the troop be withdraw from quemoy that the implication be certainly of everything that he say that quemoy could well be defend there be too many infantryman there not enough heavy artillery and certainly i do not think there be any implication in secretary dulles statement that quemoy and matsu should not be defend in the event that they be attack and that attack be a preliminary to an attack on formosa now as far as president eisenhower be concern i have often hear he discuss this question as i uh relate a moment ago the president have always indicate that we must not make the mistake in deal with the dictator of indicate that we be go to make a concession at the point of a gun whenever you do that inevitably the dictator be encourage to try it again so first it will be quemoy and matsu next it may be formosa what do we do then my point be this that once you do this follow this course of action of indicate that you be not go to defend a particular area the inevitable result be that it encourage a man who be determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return and that mean war we go through this tragic experience lead to world war ii we learn our lesson again in korea we must not learn it again that be why i think the senate be right include a majority of the democrats a majority of the republicans when they reject senator kennedy 's position in 1955 and incidentally senator johnson be among those who reject that position vote with the seventy against the twelve the senate be right because they know the lesson of history and may i say too that i would trust that senator kennedy would change his position on this change it because as long as he as a major presidential candidate continue to suggest that we be go to turn over these island he be only encourage the aggressor the chinese communist and the soviet aggressor to press the united states to press we to the point where war would be inevitable the road to war be always pave with good intention and in this instance the good intention of course be a desire for peace but certainly we be not go to have peace by give in and indicate in advance that we be not go to defend what have become a symbol of freedom

 mr shadel senator kennedy

 mr kennedy i do not think it be possible for mr. nixon to state the record in distortion of the fact with more precision than he just do in 1955 mr. dulles at a press conference say the treaty that we have with the republic of china exclude quemoy and matsu from the treaty area that be do with much thought and deliberation therefore that treaty do not commit the united states to defend anything except formosa and the pescadores and to deal with act against that treaty area i completely sustain the treaty i vote for it i would take any action necessary to defend the treaty formosa and the pescadores island what we be now talk about be the vice president 's determination to guarantee quemoy and matsu which be four and five mile off the coast of red china which be not within the treaty area i do not suggest that chiang kai shek and this administration have be attempt since 1955 to persuade chiang kai shek to lessen his troop commitment uh he send a mission the president in 1955 of mr. uh robertson and admiral radford general twining say they be still do it in 1959 general ridgway say who be chief of staff to go to war for quemoy and matsu to i would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take to i that concept be completely repugnant so i stand with they i stand with the secretary of state mr. herter who say these island be indefensible i believe that we should meet our commitment and if the chinese communists attack the pescadores and formosa they know that it will mean a war i would not ho- hand over these island under any point of gun but i merely say that the treaty be quite precise and i sustain the treaty mr. nixon would add a guarantee to island five mile off the coast of the re- republic of china when he be never really protest the communists seize cuba ninety mile off the coast of the united states

 mr shadel mr. von fremd have a question for senator kennedy

 mr von fremd senator kennedy i would like to uh shift the conversation if i may to a domestic uh political argument the chairman of the republican national committee senator thruston morton declare early this week that you owe vice president nixon and the republican party a public apology for some strong charge make by former president harry truman who bluntly suggest where the vice president and the republican party could go do you feel that you owe the vice president an apology

 mr kennedy well i must say that uh mr. truman have uh his method of express thing he be be in politic for fifty year he be be president of the united states they may be not my style but i really do not think there be anything that i could say to president truman that be go to cause he at the age of seventy six to change his particular speaking manner perhaps mrs. truman can but i do not think i can i will just have to tell mr. morton that if you would pass that message on to he

 mr shadel any comment mr. vice president

 mr nixon yes i think so of course both er senator kennedy and i have feel mr. truman 's ire and uh consequently i think he can speak with some feeling on this subject i just do want to say one thing however we all have temper i have one i be sure senator kennedy have one but when a man 's president of the united states or a former president he have an obligation not to lose his temper in public one thing i have note as i have travel around the country be the tremendous number of child who come out to see the presidential candidate i see mother hold their baby up so that they can see a man who might be president of the united states i know senator kennedy see they too it make you realize that whoever be president be go to be a man that all the child of america will either look up to or will look down to and i can only say that i be very proud that president eisenhower restore dignity and decency and frankly good language to the conduct of the presidency of the united states and i only hope that should i win this election that i could approach president eisenhower in maintain the dignity of the office in see to it that whenever any mother or father talk to his child he can look at the man in the white house and whatever he may think of his policy he will say well there be a man who maintain the kind of standard personally that i would want my child to follow

 mr shadel mr. cater 's question be for vice president nixon

 mr cater mr. vice president i would like to return just once more if i may to this area of deal with the communists critic have claim that on at least three occasion in recent year on the sending of american troop to indochina in 1954 on the matter of continue the u-2 flight uh in may and then on this definition of the of our commitment to the offshore island that you have overstate the administration position that you have take a more bellicose position than president eisenhower just two day ago you say that you call on uh senator kennedy to serve notice to communist aggressor around the world that we be not go to retreat one inch more any place where as we do retreat from the tachen islands or at least chiang kai shek do would you say this be a valid criticism of your statement of foreign policy

 mr nixon well mr. cater of course it be a criticism that uh be be make uh i obviously do not think it be valid i have support the administration 's position and i think that that position have be correct i think my position have be correct as far as indochina be concern i state over and over again that it be essential during that period that the united states make it clear that we would not tolerate indochina fall under communist domination now as a result of our take the strong stand that we do the civil war there be end and today at least in the south of indochina the communists have move out and we do have a strong free bastion there now look to the u-2 flight i would like to point out that i have be support the president 's position throughout i think the president be correct in order these flight i think the president be correct certainly in his decision to continue the flight while the conference be go on i note for example in read a uh a a particular discussion that senator kennedy have with dave garroway shortly after the uh his statement about regret that uh he make the statement that he feel that these particular flight uh be one that should not have occur right at that time and the indication be how would mr. khrushchev have feel if we have uh have a flight over the uni- how would we have feel if mr. khrushchev ha uh have a flight over the united states while uh he be visit here and the answer of course be that communist espionage go on all the time the answer be that the united states can not afford to have a es- an es a espionage lack or should we s- uh lag or should i say uh an intelligence lag any more than we can afford to have a missile lag now refer to your question with regard to quemoy and matsu what i object to here be the constant reference to surrender these island senator kennedy quote the record which he read from a moment ago but what he forget to point out be that the key vote a uh vote which i have refer to several time where he be in the minority be one which reject his position now why do they reject it for the very reason that those senator know as the president of the united states know that you should not indicate to the communists in advance that you be go to surrender an area that be free why because they know as senator kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage they to more aggression

 mr shadel senator kennedy

 mr kennedy well number one on indochina mr. nixon talk in before the newspaper editor in the spring of 1954 about put and i quote he american boy into indochina the reason indochina be preserve be the result of the geneva conference which indochina number two on the question of the u-2 flight i think the u-2 flight in may just before the conference be a mistake in timing because of the hazard involve if the summit conference have any hope for success i never criticize the u-2 flight in general however i never suggest espionage should stop it still go on i would assume on both side number three the vice president on may fifteenth after the u-2 flight indicate that the flight be go on even though the administration and the president have cancel the flight on may twelfth number three the pre vice president suggest that we should keep the communists in doubt about whether we would fight on quemoy and matsu that be not the position he be take he be indicate that we should fight for these island come what may because they be in his word in the area of freedom he do not take that position on tibet he do not take that position on budapest he do not take that position that i have see so far in laos guinea and ghana have both move within the soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy so have cuba i merely say that the united states should meet its commitment to que- to uh formosa and the pescadores but as admiral yarnell have say and he be be support by most military authority these island that we be now talk about be not worth the bone of a single american soldier and i know how difficult it be to sustain troop close to the shore under artillery bombardment and therefore i think we should make it very clear the disagreement between mr. nixon and myself he be extend the administration 's commitment

 mr shadel mr. drummond 's question be for senator kennedy

 mr drummond uh mr. kennedy representative adam clayton powell in the course of his speak tour in your behalf be say and i quote the ku klux klan be ride again in this campaign if it do not stop all bigot will vote for nixon and all right think christians and jews will vote for kennedy rather than be find in the rank of the klan minded end quotation governor michael disalle be say much the same thing what i would like to ask senator kennedy be what be the purpose of this sort of thing and how do you feel about it

 mr kennedy well the que- the mr. griffin i believe who be the head of the klan who live in tampa florida indicate a in a statement i think two or three week ago that he be not go to vote for i and that he be go to vote for mr. nixon i do not suggest in any way nor have i ever that that indicate that mr. nixon have the slight sympathy involvement or in any way imply any inference in regard to the ku klux klan that be absurd i do not suggest that i do not support it i would disagree with it mr. nixon know very well that in this in this whole matter that be be involve with the so call religious discussion in this campaign i have never suggest even by the vague implication that he do anything but disapprove it and that be my view now i disapprove of the issue i do not suggest that mr. nixon do in any way

 mr shadel mr. vice president

 mr nixon well i welcome this opportunity to join senator kennedy completely on that statement and to say before this large television audience in history something that i have be say in the past and want to will always say in the future on our last television debate i point out that it be my position that americans must choose the good man that either party could produce we can not settle for anything but the good and that mean of course the good man that this nation can produce and that mean that we can not have any test of religion we can not have any test of race it must be a test of a man also as far as religion be concern i have see communism abroad i see what it do communism be the enemy of all religion and we who do believe in god must join together we must not be divide on this issue the bad thing that i can think can happen in this campaign would be for it to be decide on religious issue i obviously repudiate the klan i repudiate anybody who use the religious issue i will not tolerate it i have order all of my people to have nothing to do with it and i say say to this great audience whoever may be listen remember if you believe in america if you want america to set the right example to the world that we can not have religious or racial prejudice we can not have it in our heart but we certainly can not have it in a presidential campaign

 mr shadel mr. mcgee have a question for vice president nixon

 mr mcgee mr. vice president some of your early campaign literature say you be make a study to see if new law be need to protect the public against excessive use of power by labor union have you decide whether such new law be need and if so what would they do

 mr nixon mr. mcgee i be plan a speech on that subject next week uh also so that we can get the uh opportunity for the questioner to question i it will be before the next television debate uh i will say simply in advance of it that i believe that in this area the law which should be pass uh as far as the big national emergency strike be concern be one that will give the president more weapon with which to deal with those strike now i have a basic disagreement with senator kennedy though on this point he have take the position when he first indicate in october of last year that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapon the president might have to stop a national emergency strike i understand in his last speech before the steelworkers union that he change that position and indicate that he feel that government seizure might be the good way to stop a strike which could not be settle by collective bargaining i do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure i think the moment that you give to the union on the one side and to management on the other side the escape hatch of eventually go to government to get it settle that most of these great strike will end up be settle by government and that will be a be in the end in my opinion wage control it would mean price control all the thing that we do not want i do believe however that we can give to the president of the united states power in addition to what he presently have in the fact finding area which would enable he to be more effective than we have be in handle these strike one last point i should make the record in handle they have be very good during this administration we have have less man hour lose by strike in these last seven year than we have in the previous seven year by a great deal and i only want to say that however good the record be it be get to be well because in this critical year period of the sixty we have get to move forward all americans must move forward together and we have to get the great cooperation possible between labor and management we can not afford stoppage of massive effect on the economy when we be in the terrible competition we be in with the soviets

 mr shadel senator your comment

 mr kennedy well i always have difficulty recognize my position when they be state by the vice president i never suggest that compulsory arbitration be the solution for national emergency dispute i be oppose to that be oppose to it in october 1958 i have suggest that the president should be give other weapon to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strike beyond the injunction provision of the taft hartley act i do not know what other weapon the vice president be talk about i be talk about give he four or five tool not only the fact find committee that he now have under the injunction provision not only the injunction but also the power of the fact find commission to make recommendation recommendation which would not be bind but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind they one of the additional power that i would suggest would be seizure there might be other by the president have five power four or five power and he only have very limited power today neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be use and therefore there would be a great incentive on both side to reach an agreement themselves without take it to the government the difficulty now be the president 's course be quite limited he can set up a fact find committee the fact find committee 's power be limited he can provide an injunction if there be a national emergency for eighty day then the strike can go on and there be no other power or action that the president could take unless he go to the congress this be a difficult and sensitive matter but to state my view precisely the president should have a variety of thing he could do he could leave the party in doubt as to which one he would use and therefore there would be incentive instead of as now the steel company be ready to take the strike because they feel the injunction of eighty day would break the union which do not happen

 mr shadel the next question be by mr. cater for senator kennedy

 mr cater uh mr. kennedy uh senator uh vice president nixon say that he have cost the two party platform and that yours would run at least ten billion dollar a year more than his you have deny his figure he have call on you to supply your figure would you do that

 mr kennedy yes i have state in both uh debate and state again that i believe in a balanced budget and have support that concept during my fourteen year in the congress the only two time when an unbalanced budget be warrant would be during a serious recession and we have that in fifty eight in an unbalanced budget of twelve billion dollar or a national emergency where there should be large expenditure for national defense which we have in world war ii and uh during part of the korean war on the question of the cost of our budget i have state that it be my good judgment that our agricultural program will cost a billion and a half possibly two billion dollar less than the present agricultural program my judgment be that the program the vice president put forward which be an extension of mr. benson 's program will cost a billion dollar more than the present program which cost about six billion dollar a year the most expensive in history we have spend more money on agriculture in the last eight year than the hundred year of the agricultural department before that secondly i believe that the high interest rate policy that this administration have follow have add about three billion dollar a year to interest on the debt merely fund the debt which be a burden an the taxpayer i would hope under a different monetary policy that it would be possible to reduce that interest rate burden at least a billion dollar third i think it be possible to gain a seven hundred million to a billion dollar through tax change which i believe would close up loof- loophole on dividend withholding on expense account fourthly i have suggest that the medical care for the aged and the bill which the congress now have pass and the president sign if fully implement would cost a billion dollar on the treasury out of treasury fund and a billion dollar by the states the proposal that i have put forward and which many of the member of my party support be for medical care finance under social security which would be finance under the social security taxis which be less than three cent a day per person for medical care doctor bill nurse hospital when they retire it be actuarially sound so in my judgment we would spend more money in this administration on aid to education we would spend more money on housing we would spend more money and i hope more wisely on defense than this administration have but i believe that the next administration should work for a balanced budget and that would be my intention mr. nixon misstate my figure constantly which uh be of course his right but the fact of the matter be here be where i stand and i just want to have it on the public record

 mr shadel mr. vice president

 mr nixon senator kennedy have indicate on several occasion in this program tonight that i have be misstate his record and his figure i will issue a white paper after this broadcast quote exactly what he say on compulsory arbitration for example and the record will show that i have be correct now as far as his figure be concern here tonight he again be engage in this what i would call mirror game of here it be and here it isn't uh on the one hand for example he suggest that as far as his medical care program be concerned that that really be not a problem because it be from social security but social security be a tax the people pay it it come right out of your paycheck this do not mean that the people be not go to be pay the bill he also indicate as far as his agricultural program be concerned that he feel it will cost less than our well all that i can suggest be that all the expert who have study the program indicate that it be the most fantastic program the bad program insofar as its effect on the farmer that the america have ever have foist upon it in an election year or any other time and i would also point out that senator kennedy leave out a part of the cost of that program a twenty five percent rise in food price that the people would have to pay now be we go to have that when it be not go to help the farmer i do not think we should have that kind of a program then he go on to say that he be go to change the interest rate situation and we be go to get some more money that way well what he be say there in effect we be go to have inflation we be go to go right back to what we have under mr. truman when he have political control of the federal reserve board i do not believe we ought to pay our bill through inflation through a phony interest rate

 mr shadel next mr. drummond 's question for vice president nixon

 mr drummond uh mr. nixon uh before the convention you and governor rockefeller say jointly that the nation 's economic growth ought to be accelerate and the republican platform state that uh the nation need to quicken the pace of economic growth uh be it fair therefore mr. vice president to conclude that you feel that there have be insufficient economic growth during the past eight year and if so what would you do beyond uh present administration policy uh to step it up

 mr nixon mr. drummond i be never satisfied with the economic growth of this country i be not satisfied with it even if there be no communism in the world but particularly when we be in the kind of a race we be in we have get to see that america grow just as fast as we can provide we grow soundly because even though we have maintain as i point out in our first debate the absolute gap over the soviet union even though the growth in this administration have be twice as much as it be in the truman administration that be not good enough because america must be able to grow enough not only to take care of our need at home for well education and housing and health all these thing we want we have get to grow enough to maintain the force that we have abroad and to wage the non military battle for the war uh for the world in asia in africa and latin america it be go to cost more money and growth will help we to win that battle now what do we do about it and here i believe basically that what we have to do be to stimulate that sector of america the private enterprise sector of the economy in which there be the great possibility for expansion so that be why i advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy in addition to that we have to move on other area that be hold back growth i refer for example to distressed area we have to move into those area with program so that we make adequate use of the resource of those area we also have to see that all of the people of the united states the tremendous talent that our people have be use adequately that be why in this whole area of civil right the equality of opportunity for employment and education be not just for the benefit of the minority group it be for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientist and the engineer and all the rest that we need and in addition to that we need program particularly in high education which will stimulate scientific breakthrough which will bring more growth now what all this of course add up to be this america have not be stand still let us get that straight anybody who say america 's be stand still for the last seven and a half year have not be travel around america he be be travel in some other country we have be move we have be move much fast than we do in the truman year but we can and must move fast and that be why i stand so strongly for program that will move america forward in the sixty move she forward so that we can stay ahead of the soviet union and win the battle for freedom and peace

 mr shadel senator kennedy

 mr kennedy well first may i correct a statement which be make before that under my agricultural program food price would go up twenty five percent that be untrue the fa- the farmer who grow wheat get about two and a half cent out of a twenty five cent loaf of bread even if you put his income up ten percent that would be two and three quarter percent three pers- or three cent out of that twenty five cent the t- man who grow tomato it cost less for those tomato than it do for the label on the can and i believe when the average hour for many farmer wage be about fifty cent an hour he should do well but anybody who suggest that that program would c- come to any figure indicate by the vice president be in error the vice president suggest a number of thing he suggest that we aid distressed area the administration have veto that bill pass by the congress twice he suggest we pass an aid to education bill but the administration and the republican majority in the congress have oppose any realistic aid to education and the vice president cast the decide vote against federal aid for teacher salary in the senate which prevent that be add this administration and this country last year have the low rate of economic growth which mean job of any major industrialize society in the world in 1959 and when we have to find twenty five thousand new job a week for the next ten year we be go to have to grow more governor rockefeller say five per cent the democratic platform and other say five per cent many say four and a half per cent the last eight year the average growth have be about two and a half per cent that be why we do not have full employment today

 mr shadel mr. mcgee have the next question for senator kennedy

 mr mcgee uh senator kennedy a moment ago you mention tax loophole now your running mate senator lyndon johnson be from texas an oil produce state and one that many political leader feel be in doubt in this election year and report from there say that oil man in texas be seek assurance from senator johnson that the oil depletion allowance will not be cut the democratic platform pledge to plug hole in the tax law and refer to inequitable depletion allowance as be conspicuous loophole my question be do you consider the twenty seven and a half per cent depletion allowance inequitable and would you ask that it be cut

 mr kennedy uh mr. mcgee there be about a hundred and four commodity that have some kind of depletion allowance different kind of mineral include oil i believe all of those should be go over in detail to make sure that no one be get a tax break to make sure that no one be get away from pay the taxis he ought to pay that include oil it include all kind of mineral it include everything within the range of taxation we want to be sure it be fair and equitable it include oil abroad perhaps that oil abroad should be treat differently than the oil here at home now the oil industry recently have have hard time particularly some of the small producer they be move about eight or nine day in texas but i can assure you that if i be elect president the whole spectrum of taxis will be go through carefully and if there be any inequity in oil or any other commodity then i would vote to close that loophole i have vote in the past to reduce the depletion allowance for the large producer for those from five million dollar down to maintain it at twenty seven and a half per cent i believe we should study this and other allowance tax expense dividend expense and all the rest and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth how we can provide the revenue need to move our country forward

 mr shadel mr. vice president

 mr nixon senator kennedy 's position and mine completely different on this i favor the present depletion allowance i favor it not because i want to make a lot of oil man rich but because i want to make america rich why do we have a depletion allowance because this be the stimulation the incentive for company to go out and explore for oil to develop it if we do not have a depletion allowance of certainly i believe the present amount we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country now as far as my position then be concern it be exactly opposite to the senator 's and it be because of my belief that if america be go to have the growth that he talk about and that i talk about and that we want the thing to do be not to discourage individual enterprise not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and mineral but to encourage they and so he would be do exactly the wrong thing one other thing he suggest that there be a number of other item in this whole depletion field that could be take into account he also say a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his program by revise the tax law include depletion i should point out that as far as depletion allowance be concern the oil depletion allowance be one that provide eighty percent of all of those involve in depletion so you be not go to get much from revenue insofar as depletion allowance be concern unless you move in the area that he indicate but i oppose it i oppose it for the reason that i mention i oppose it because i want we to have more oil exploration and not less

 mr shadel gentleman if i may remind you time be grow short so please keep your question and answer as brief as possible consistent with clarity mr. von fremd for vice president nixon

 mr von fremd mr. vice president in the past three year there have be an exodus of more than four billion dollar of gold from the united states apparently for two reason because export have slump and have not cover import and because of increase american investment abroad if you be president how would you go about stop this departure of gold from our shore

 mr nixon well mr. von fremd the first thing we have to do be to continue to keep confidence abroad in the american dollar that mean that we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can because the moment that we have loss of confidence in our own fiscal policy at home it result in gold flow out secondly we have to increase our export as compare with our import and here we have a very strong program go forward in the department of commerce this one must be step up beyond that as far as the gold supply be concern and as far as the movement of gold be concern uh we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our ally abroad in this great venture in which all free man be involve of win the battle for freedom now america have be carry a tremendous load in this respect i think we have be right in carry it i have favor our program abroad for economic assistance and for military assistance but now we find that the country of europe for example that we have aid and japan that we have aid in the far east these country some our former enemy have now recover completely they have get to bear a great share of this load of economic assistance abroad that be why i be advocate and will develop during the course of the next administration if of course i get the opportunity a program in which we enlist more aid from these other country on a concerted basis in the program of economic development for africa asia and latin america the united states can not continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself we can a big share of it but we have get to have more help from our friend abroad and these three factor i think will be very helpful in reverse the gold flow which you speak about

 mr shadel senator kennedy

 mr kennedy just to uh correct the record mr. nixon say on depletion that his record be the opposite of mine what i say be that this matter should be thoroughly go into to make sure that there be not loophole if his record be the opposite of that that mean that he do not want to go into it now on the question of gold the difficulty of course be that we do have heavy obligation abroad that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollar overseas to pay our troop maintain our basis and sustain other economy in other word if we be go to continue to maintain our position in the sixty we have to maintain a sound monetary and fiscal policy we have to have control over inflation and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade we have to be able to compete in the world market we have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume uh from abroad if we be go to be able to meet our obligation in addition many of the country around the world still keep restriction against our goad go all the way back to the day when there be a dollar shortage now there be not a dollar shortage and yet many of these country continue to move against our good i believe that we must be able to compete in the market steel and in all the basic commodity abroad we must be able to compete against they because we always do because of our technological lead we have to be sure to maintain that we have to persuade these other country not to restrict our good come in not to act as if there be a dollar gap and third we have to persuade they to assume some of the responsibility that up till now we have maintain to assist underdeveloped country in africa latin america and asia make an economic breakthrough on their own

 mr shadel mr. drummond 's question now for senator kennedy

 mr drummond senator kennedy a question on american prestige in light of the fact that the soviet ambassador be recently expel from the congo and that mr. khrushchev have this week cancel his trip to cuba for fear of stir resentment throughout all latin america i would like to ask you to spell out somewhat more fully how you think we should measure american prestige to determine whether it be rise or whether it be fall

 mr kennedy well i think there be many uh test mr. drummond of prestige and the significance of prestige really be because we be so identify with the cause of freedom therefore if we be on the mount if we be rise if our influence be spread if our prestige be spread then those uh who stand now on the razor edge of decision between we or between the communist system wonder whether they should use the system of freedom to develop their country or the system of communism they will be persuade to follow our example there have be several indication that our prestige be not as high as it once be mr. george allen the head of our information service say that a result of our be second in space in the sputnik in 1957 and i quote he i believe i paraphrase he accurately he say that many of these country equate space development with scientific productivity and scientific advancement and therefore he say many of these country now feel that the soviet union which be once so backward be now on a par with the united states secondly the economic growth of the soviet union be great than our mr. dulles have suggest it be from two to three time as great as ours this have a great effect on the s- underdeveloped world which face problem of low income and high population density and inadequate resource three a gallup poll take in february ask people in ten country which country they think would be first in 1970 both scientifically and militarily and a majority in every country except greece feel that it would be the soviet union by l970 four in the vote at the u.n. particularly the vote deal with red china last saturday we receive the support on the position that we have take of only two african country one liberia which have be tie to we for more than a century and the other union of south africa which be not a popular country in africa every other ca- african country either abstain or vote against we a more country vote against we in asia on this issue than vote with we on the neutralist resolution which we be so much opposed to the same thing happen the candidate who be a candidate for the president of brazil take a trip to cuba to call on mr. castro during the election in order to get the benefit of the castro supporter uh within brazil there be many indication guinea and ghana two independent country within the last three year guinea in fifty seven ghana within the last eighteen month both now be support the soviet foreign policy at the u.n. mr. herter say so himself laos be move in that direction so i would say our prestige be not so high no long do we give the image of be on the rise no long do we give an image of vitality

 mr shadel mr. vice president

 mr nixon well i would say first of all that senator 's kennedy 's statement that he be just make be not go to help our gallup polls abroad and it be not go to help our prestige either let us look at the other side of the coin let us look at the vote on the congo the vote be seventy to nothing against the soviet union let us look at the situation with regard to economic growth as it really be we find that the soviet union be a very primitive economy its growth rate be not what count it be whether it be catch up with we and it be not catch up with we we be well ahead and we can stay ahead provide we have confidence in america and do not run she down in order to build she up we could look also at other item which senator kennedy have name but i will only conclude by say this in this whole matter of prestige in the final analysis its whether you stand for what be right and get back to this matter that we discuss at the outset the matter of quemoy and matsu i can think of nothing that will be a great blow to the prestige of the united states among the free nation in asia than for we to take senator kennedy 's advan- advice to go go against what a majority of the member of the senate both democrat and republican do say in 1955 and to say in advance we will surrender an area to the communists in other word if the united states be go to maintain its strength and its prestige we must not only be strong militarily and economically we must be firm diplomatically thi- certainly we have be speak i know of whether we should have retreat or defeat let us remember the way to win be not to retreat and not to surrender

 mr nixon mr. howe senator kennedy my fellow americans since this campaign begin i have have a very rare privilege i have travel to forty eight of the fifty state and in my travel i have learn what the people of the united states be think about there be one issue that stand out above all the rest one in which every american be concern regardless of what group he may be a member and regardless of where he may live and that issue very simply state be this how can we keep the peace keep it without surrender how can we extend freedom extend it without war now in determine how we deal with this issue we must find the answer to a very important but simple question who threaten the peace who threaten freedom in the world there be only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom that that be present by the international communist movement and therefore if we be to have peace we must know how to deal with the communists and their leader i know mr. khrushchev i also have have the opportunity of know and meet other communist leader in the world i believe there be certain principle we must find in deal with he and his colleague principle if follow that will keep the peace and that also can extend freedom first we have to learn from the past because we can not afford to make the mistake of the past in the seven year before this administration come into power in washington we find that six hundred million people go behind the iron curtain and at the end of that seven year we be engage in a war in korea which cost of thirty thousand american life in the past seven year in president eisenhower 's administration this situation have be reverse we end the korean war by strong firm leadership we have keep out of other war and we have avoid surrender of principle or territory at the conference table now why be we successful as our predecessor be not successful i think there be several reason in the first place they make a fatal error in misjudge the communists in try to apply to they the same rule of conduct that you would apply to the leader of the free world one of the major error they make be the one that lead to the korean war in rule out the defense of korea they invite aggression in that area they think they be go to have peace it bring war we learn from their mistake and so in our seven year we find that we have be firm in our diplomacy we have never make concession without get concession in return we have always be willing to go the extra mile to negotiate for disarmament or in any other area but we have never be willing to do anything that in effect surrender freedom any place in the world that be why president eisenhower be correct in not apologize or express regret to mr. khrushchev at the paris conference as senator kennedy suggest he could have do that be why senator wh- president eisenhower be also correct in his policy in the formosa straits where he decline and refuse to follow the recommendation recommendation which senator kennedy vote for in 1955 again make in 1959 again repeat in his debate that you have hear recommendation with regard to again slice off a piece of free territory and abandon it if in effect to the communists why do the president feel this be wrong and why be the president right and his critic wrong because again this show a lack of understanding of dictator a lack of understanding particularly of communists because every time you make such a concession it do not lead to peace it only encourage they to blackmail you it encourage they to begin a war and so i say that the record show that we know how to keep the peace to keep it without surrender let we move now to the future it be not enough to stand on this record because we be deal with the most ruthless fanatical leader that the world have ever see that be why i say that in this period of the sixty america must move forward in every area first of all although we be today as senator kennedy have admit the strong nation in the world militarily we must increase our strength increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponent have if the should launch a surprise attack we will be able to destroy their war make capability they must know in other word that it be national suicide if they begin anything we need this kind of strength because we be the guardian of the peace in addition to military strength we need to see that the economy of this country continue to grow it have grow in the past seven year it can and will grow even more in the next four and the reason that it must grow even more be because we have thing to do at home and also because we be in a race for survival a race in which it be not enough to be ahead it be not enough simply to be complacent we have to move ahead in order to stay ahead and that be why in this field i have make recommendation which i be confident will move the american economy ahead move it firmly and soundly so that there will never be a time when the soviet union will be able to challenge our superiority in this field and so we need military strength we need economic strength we also need the right diplomatic policy what be they again we turn to the past firmness but no belligerence and by no belligerence i mean that we do not answer insult by insult when you be proud and confident of your strength you do not get down to the level of mr. khrushchev and his colleague and that example that president eisenhower have set we will continue to follow but all this by itself be not enough it be not enough for we simply to be the strong nation militarily the strong economically and also to have firm diplomacy we must have a great goal and that be not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world to extend it to all the world because that be america 's destiny to extend it to all the world because the communist aim be not to hold their own but to extend communism and you can not fight a victory for communism or a strategy of victory for communism with the strategy simply of hold the line and so i say that we believe that our policy of military strength of economic strength of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender we also believe that in the great field of ideal that we can lead america to the victory for freedom victory in the newly develop country victory also in the captive country provide we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principle

 mr howe now the opening statement of senator kennedy

 mr kennedy mr. howe mr. vice president first uh let i again try to correct the record on the matter of quemoy and matsu i vote for the formosa resolution in 1955 i have sustain it since then i have say that i agree with the administration policy mr. nixon early indicate that he would defend quemoy and matsu even if the attack on these island two mile off the coast of china be not part of a general attack an formosa and the pescadores i indicate that i would defend those island if the attack be direct against pescadores and formosa which be part of the eisenhower policy i have support that policy in the last week as a member of the senate foreign relations committee i have re read the testimony of general twining represent the administration in 1959 and the assistant secretary of state before the foreign relations committee in 1958 and i have accurately describe the administration policy and i support it wholeheartedly so that really be not an issue in this campaign it be not an issue with mr. nixon who now say that he also support the eisenhower policy nor be the question that all americans want peace and security an issue in this campaign the question be be we move in the direction of peace and security be our relative strength grow be as mr. nixon say our prestige at an all time high as he say a week ago and that of the communists at an all time low i do not believe it be i do not believe that our relative strength be increase and i say that not as the democratic standard bearer but as a citizen of the united states who be concerned about the united states i look at cuba ninety mile off the coast of the united states in 1957 i be in havana i talk to the american ambassador there he say that he be the second most powerful man in cuba and yet even though ambassador smith and ambassador gardner both republican ambassadors both warn of castro the marxist influence around castro the communist influence around castro both of they have testify in the last six week that in spite of their warning to the american government nothing be do our d- security depend upon latin america can any american look at the situation in latin america feel contented with what be happen today when a candidate for the presidency of brazil feel it necessary to call not on washington during the campaign but on castro in havana in order to pick up the support of the castro supporter in brazil at the american conference inter american conference this summer when we want they to join together in the denunciation of castro and the cuban communists we could not even get the inter american group to join together in denounce castro it be rather a vague statement that they finally make do you know today that the com- the russians broadcast ten time as many program in spanish to latin america as we do do you know we do not have a single program sponsor by our government to cuba to tell they our story to tell they that we be their friend that we want they to be free again africa be now the emerge area of the world it contain twenty five percent of all the member of the general assembly we do not even have a bureau of african affairs until 1957 in the africa south of the sahara which be the major new section we have less student from all of africa in that area study under government auspex today than from the country of thailand if there be one thing africa need it be technical assistance and yet last year we give they less than five percent of all the technical assistance fund that we distribute around the world we rely in the middle east on the baghdad pact and yet when the iraqi government be change the baghdad pact break down we rely on the eisenhower doctrine for the middle east which pass the senate there be not one country in the middle east that now endorse the eisenhower doctrine we look to europe uh to asia because the struggle be in the underdeveloped world which system communism or freedom will triumph in the next five or ten year that be what should concern we not the history of ten or fifteen or twenty year ago but be we do enough in these area what be freedom 's chance in those area by 1965 or 1970 will there be other cubas in latin america will guinea and ghana which have now vote with the communists frequently as newly independent country of africa will there be other will the congo go communist will other country be we do enough in that area and what about asia be india go to win the economic struggle or be china go to win it who will dominate asia in the next five or ten year communism the chinese or will freedom the question which we have to decide as americans be we do enough today be our strength and prestige rise do people want to be identify with we do they want to follow united states leadership i do not think they do enough and that be what concern i in africa these country that have newly join the united nations on the question of admission of red china only two country in all of africa vote with us liberia and the union of south africa the rest either abstain or vote against we more country in asia vote against we on that question than vote with we i believe that this struggle be go to go on and it may be well decide in the next decade i have see cuba go to the communists i have see communist influence and castro influence rise in latin america i have see we ignore africa there be six country in africa that be member of the united nations there be not a single american diplomatic representative in any of those six when guinea become independent the soviet ambassador show up that very day we do not recognize they for two month the american ambassador do not show up for nearly eight month i believe that the world be change fast and i do not think this administration have show the foresight have show the knowledge have be identify with the great fight which these people be wage to be free to get a well standard of living to live well the average income in some of those country be twenty five dollar a year the communists say come with we look what we have do and we have be in on the whole uninterested i think we be go to have to do well mr. nixon talk about our be the strong country in the world i think we be today but we be far strong relative to the communists five year ago and what be of great concern be that the balance of power be in danger of move with they they make a breakthrough in missile and by nineteen sixty one two and three they will be outnumber we in missile i be not as confident as he be that we will be the strong military power by 1963 he talk about economic growth as a great indicator of freedom i agree with he what we do in this country the kind of society that we build that will tell whether freedom will be sustain around the world and yet in the last nine month of this year we have have a drop in our economic growth rather than a gain we have have the low rate of increase of economic growth in the last nine month of any major industrialize society in the world i look up and see the soviet flag on the moon the fact be that the state department poll on our prestige and influence around the world have show such a sharp drop that up till now the state department have be unwilling to release they and yet they be poll by the u.s.i.a. the point of all this be this be a struggle in which we be engaged we want peace we want freedom we want security we want to be strong we want freedom to gain but i do not believe in these change and revolutionary time this administration have know that the world be change have identify itself with that change i think the communists have be move with vigor laos africa cuba all around the world today they be on the move i think we have to revita1ize our society i think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that we be determined in this free country of our to be first not first if and not first but and not first when but first and when we be strong and when we be first then freedom gain then the prospect for peace increase then the prospect for our society gain

 mr howe that complete the opening statement now the candidate will answer and comment upon question put by these four correspondent frank singiser of mutual news john edwards of abc news walter cronkite of cbs news john chancellor of nbc news frank singiser have the first question for vice president nixon

 mr singiser mr. vice president i would like to pin down the difference between the way you would handle castro 's regime and prevent the establishment of communist government in the western hemisphere and the way that t senator kennedy would proceed uh vice president nixon in what important respect do you feel there be difference between you and why do you believe your policy be well for the peace and security of the united states in the western hemisphere

 mr nixon our policy be very different i think that senator kennedy 's policy and recommendation for the handling of the castro regime be probably the most dangers- dangerously irresponsible recommendation that he be make during the course of this campaign in effect what senator kennedy recommend be that the united states government should give help to the exile and to those within cuba who oppose the castro regime provide they be anti batista now let us just see what this mean we have five treaty with latin america include the one set up the organization of american states in bogota in 1948 in which we have agree not to intervene in the internal affair of any other american country and they as well have agree to do likewise the charter of the united nations its preamble article i and article ii also provide that there shall be no intervention by one nation in the internal affair of another now i do not know what senator kennedy suggest when he say that we should help those who oppose the castro regime both in cuba and without but i do know this that if we be to follow that recommendation that we would lose all of our friend in latin america we would probably be condemn in the united nations and we would not accomplish our objective i know something else it would be an open invitation for mr. khrushchev to come in to come into latin america and to engage we in what would be a civil war and possibly even bad than that this be the major recommendation that he be make now what can we do well we can do what we do with guatemala there be a communist dictator that we inherit from the previous administration we quarantine mr. arbenz the result be that the guatemalan people themselves eventually rise up and they throw he out we be quarantine mr. castro today we be quarantine he diplomatically by bring back our ambassador economically by cut off trade and senator kennedy 's suggestion that the trade that we cut off be not significant be just one hundred percent wrong we be cut off the significant item that the cuban regime need in order to survive by cut off trade by cut off our diplomatic relation as we have we will quarantine this regime so that the people of cuba themselves will take care of mr. castro but for we to do what senator kennedy have suggest would bring result which i know he would not want and certainly which the american people would not want

 mr kennedy mr. nixon uh show himself i- misinformed he surely must be aware that most of the equipment and arm and resource for castro come from the united states flow out of florida and other part of the united states to castro in the mountain there be not any doubt about that number one number two i believe that if any economic sanction against latin america be go to be successful they have to be multilateral they have to include the other country of latin america the very minute effect of the action which have be take this week on cuba 's economy i believe castro can replace those market very easily through latin america through europe and through eastern europe if the united states have strong prestige and influence in latin america it could persuade as franklin roosevelt do in 1940 the country of latin america to join in an economic quarantine of castro that be the only way you can bring real economic pressure on the castro regime and also the country of western europe canada japan and the other number three castro be only the beginning of our difficulty throughout latin america the big struggle will be to prevent the influence of castro spread to other country mexico panama bolivia colombia we be go to have to try to provide close tie to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a well life if we be go to prevent castro 's influence from spread throughout all of latin america his influence be strong enough today to prevent we from joi- get the other country of latin america to join with we in economic quarantine his influence be grow mostly because this administration have ignore latin america you yourself say mr. vice president a month ago that if we have provide the kind of economic aid five year ago that we be now provide we might never have have castro why do not we

 mr howe john edwards have his first question for senator kennedy

 mr edwards senator kennedy one test of a new president 's leadership will be the caliber of his appointment it be a matter of interest here and overseas as to who will be the new secretary of state now under our rule i must ask this question of you but i would hope that the vice president also would answer it will you give we the name of three or four americans each of whom if appoint would serve with distinction in your judgment as secretary of state

 mr kennedy mr. edwards i do not think it be a wise idea for presidential candidate to appoint the member of his cabinet prospectively or to suggest four people indicate that one of they surely will be appoint this be a decision that the president of the united states must make the last candidate who indicate that he know who his cabinet be go to be be mr. dewey in 1948 this be a race between the vice president and myself for the presidency of the united states there be a good many able man who could be secretary of state i have make no judgment about who should be secretary of state i think that judgment could be make after election if i be successful the people have to make a choice between mr. nixon and myself between the republican party and the democratic party between our approach to the problem which now disturb we as a nation and disturb we as a world power the president bear the constitutional responsibility not the secretary of state for the conduct of foreign affair some president have be strong in foreign policy other have rely heavily on the secretary of state i have be a member of the senate foreign relations committee i run for the presidency with full knowledge that his great responsibility really give to he by the constitution and by the force of event be in the field of foreign affair i be ask the people 's support as president we will select the good man we can get but i have not make a judgment and i have not narrow down a list of three or four people among whom would be the candidate

 mr howe mr. vice president do you have a comment

 mr nixon well mr. edwards as you probably know i have consistently answer all question with regard to who will be in the next cabinet by say that that be the responsibility of the next president and it would be inappropriate to make any decision on that or to announce any prior to the time that i have the right to do so so that be my answer to this question if you do not mind i would like to use the balance of the time to respond to one of the comment that senator kennedy make on the previous question eh- he be talk about the castro regime and what we have be eh- do in latin america i would like to point out that when we look at our program in latin america we find that we have appropriate five time as much for latin america as be appropriate by the previous administration we find that we have two billion dollar more for the export import bank we have a new bank for latin america alone of a billion dollar we have the new program which be submit at the bogota conference this new program that president eisenhower submit approve by the last congress for five hundred million dollar we have move in latin america very effectively and i would also like to point this out senator kennedy complain very appropriately about our inadequate ra- radio broadcast for latin america let i point out again that his congress the democratic congress have cut eighty million dollar off of the voice of america appropriation now he have to get a well job out of his congress if he be go to get we the money that we need to conduct the foreign affair of this country in latin america or any place else

 mr howe walter cronkite you have your first question for vice president nixon

 mr cronkite thank you quincy mr. vice president senator fulbright and now tonight senator kennedy maintain that the administration be suppress a report by the united states information agency that show a decline in united states prestige overseas be you aware of such a report and if you be aware of the existence of such a report should not that report because of the great importance this issue have be give in this campaign be release to the public

 mr nixon mr. cronkite i naturally be aware of it because i of course pay attention to everything senator kennedy say as well as senator fulbright now in this connection i want to point out that the fact simply be not as state first of all the report to which senator kennedy refer be one that be make many many month ago and relate particularly to the uh period immediately after sputnik second as far as this report be concern i would have no objection to have it make public third i would say this with regard to this report with regard to gallup polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we have be hear about what about american prestige abroad america 's prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesman for america allow it to be now when we have a presidential candidate for example senator kennedy state over and over again that the united states be second in space and the fact of the matter be that the space score today be twenty eight to eight we have have twenty eight successful shot they have have eight when he state that we be second in education and i have see soviet education and i have see our and we be not that we be second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another when overall we be way ahead of the soviet union and all other country in science when he say as he do in january of this year that we have the bad slum that we have the most crowded school when he say that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night when he make statement like this what do this do to american prestige well it can only have the effect certainly of reduce it well let i make one thing clear senator kennedy have a responsibility to criticize those thing that be wrong but he have also a responsibility to be right in his criticism every one of these item that i have mention he be be wrong dead wrong and for that reason he have contribute to any lack of prestige finally let i say this as far as prestige be concern the first place it would show up would be in the united nations now senator kennedy have refer to the vote on communist china let us look at the vote on hungary there we get more vote for condemn hungary and look into that situation than we get the last year let us look at the reaction eh reaction to khrushchev and eisenhower at the last u.n. session do khrushchev gain because he take his shoe off and pound the table and shout and insult not at all the president gain america gain by continue the dignity the decency that have characterize we and it be that that keep the prestige of america up not run down america the way senator kennedy have be run she down

 mr howe comment senator kennedy

 mr kennedy i really do not need uh mr. nixon to tell i about what my responsibility be as a citizen i have serve this country for fourteen year in the congress and before that in the service i have just as high a devotion just as high an opinion what i downgrade mr. nixon be the leadership the country be get not the country now i do not make most of the statement that you say i make the s- i believe the soviet union be first in outer space we have may have make more shot but the size of their rocket thrust and all the rest you yourself say to khrushchev you may be ahead of we in rocket thrust but we be ahead of you in color television in your famous discussion in the kitchen i think that color television be not as important as rocket thrust secondly i do not say we have the bad slum in the world i say we have too many slum and that they be bad and we ought to do something about they and we ought to support housing legislation which this administration have oppose i do not say we have the bad education in the world what i say be that ten year ago we be produce twice as many scientist and engineer as the soviet union and today they be produce twice as many as we be and that this affect our security around the world and fourth i believe that the poll and other study and vote in the united nations and anyone read the paper and any citizen of the united states must come to the conclusion that the united states no long carry the same image of a vital society on the move with its bright day ahead as it carry a decade or two decade ago part of that be because we have stand still here at home because we have not meet our problem in the united states because we have not have a move economy part of that as the gallup polls show be because the soviet union make a breakthrough in outer space mr. george allen head of your information service have say that that make the people of the world begin to wonder whether we be first in science we be first in other area of science but in space which be the new science we be not first

 mr howe john chancellor your first question for senator kennedy

 mr chancellor senator another question uh in connection with our relation with the russians there have be story from washington from the atomic energy commission hint that the russians may have resume the testing of nuclear device now if sir if this be true should the united states resume nuclear testing and if the russians do not start testing can you foresee any circumstance in 1961 in which the united states might resume its own series of test

 mr kennedy yes i think the next president of the united states should make one last effort to secure an agreement on the cessation of test number one i think we should go back to geneva who be ever elect president mr. nixon or myself and try once again if we fail then if we be unable to come to an agreement and i hope we can come to an agreement because it do not merely involve now the united states britain france and the soviet union as atomic power because new breakthrough in atomic energy technology there be some indication that by the time the next president 's term of office have come to an end there may be ten fifteen or twenty country with an atomic capacity perhaps that many testing bomb with all the effect that it could have on the atmosphere and with all the chance that more and more country will have an atomic capacity with more and more chance of war so one more effort should be make i do not think that even if that effort fail that it will be necessary to carry on test in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere they can be carry out underground they c- could be carry on in outer space but i believe the effort should be make once more by who be ever elect president of the united states if we fail it be be a great serious failure for everyone for the human race i hope we can succeed but then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the russians and then we will have to meet our responsibility to the security of the united states and there may have to be test underground i think the atomic energy committee be prepare for it there may be test in outer space i hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh testing in the atmosphere it be possible to detect those kind of test the kind of test which you can not detect be underground or in in uh perhaps in outer space so that i be hopeful we can try once more if we fail then we must meet our responsibility to ourselves but i be most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapon china may have it by 1963 egypt war have be the constant companion of mankind so to have these weapon disseminate around the world i believe mean that we be go to move through a period of hazard in the next few year we ought to make one last effort

 mr howe any comment mr. vice president

 mr nixon yes i would say first of all that we must have in mind the fact that we have be negotiate to get test inspect and uh to get an agreement for many many month as a matter of fact there be be a moratorium on testing as a result of the fact that we have be negotiate i have reach the conclusion that the soviet union be actually filibuster i have reach the conclusion too base on the report that have be make that they may be cheat i do not think we can wait until the next president be inaugurate and then uh select a new team and then all the month of negotiating that will take place before we reach a decision i think that immediately after this election we should set a timetable the next president work with the present president president eisenhower a timetable to break the soviet filibuster there should be no test in the atmosphere that rule out any fall out but as far as underground test for develop peaceful use of atomic energy we should not allow this soviet filibuster to continue i think it be time for they to fish or cut bait i think that the next president immediately after his election should sit down with the president work out a timetable and get a decision on this before january of next year

 mr howe our second round of question begin with one from mr. edwards for the vice president

 mr edwards mr. nixon carry forward this business about a timetable as you know the pressure be increase for a summit conference now both you and senator kennedy have say that there be certain condition which must be meet before you would meet with khrushchev will you be more specific about these condition

 mr nixon well the condition i lay out in one of our previous television debate and it be rather difficult to be much more specific than that uh first of all we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference this mean at the secretary of state level and at the ambassadorial level by adequate preparation i mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda an agenda agree upon with the approval of the head of state involve now this agenda should delineate those issue on which there be a possibility of some agreement or negotiation i do not believe we should go to a summit conference unless we have such an agenda unless we have some reasonable insur- assurance from mr. khrushchev that he intend seriously to negotiate on those point now this may seem like a rigid inflexible position but let us look at the other side of the coin if we build up the hope of the world by have a summit conference that be not adequately prepare and then if mr. khrushchev find some excuse for break it up as he do this one because he be not go to get his way we would set back the cause of peace we do not help it we can in other word negotiate many of these item of difference between we without go to the summit i think we have to make a great effort than we have be make at the secretary of state level at the ambassadorial level to work out the difference that we have and so far as the summit conference be concern it should only be enter in upon it should only be agree upon if the negotiation have reach the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something be go to come out of it other than some phony spirit a spirit of geneva or camp david or whatever it be when i say phony spirit i mean phony not because the spirit be not good on our side but because the soviet union simply do not intend to carry out what they say now these be the condition that i can lay out i can not be more precise than that because until we see what mr. khrushchev do and what he say uh we can not indicate what our plan will be

 mr howe any comment senator kennedy

 mr kennedy well i think the president of the united states last winter indicate that before he would go to the summit in may he do last fall he indicate that there should be some agenda that there should be some prior agreement he hope that there would be uh b- be an agreement in part in disarmament he also express the hope that there should be some understanding of the general situation in berlin the soviet union refuse to agree to that and we go to the summit and it be disastrous i believe we should not go to the summit until there be some reason to believe that a meeting of mind can be obtain on either berlin outer space or general disarmament include nuclear testing in addition i believe the next president in january and february should go to work in build the strength of the united states the soviet union do understand strength we arm to parley winston churchill say ten year ago if we be strong particularly as we face a crisis over berlin which we may in the spring or in the winter it be important that we maintain our determination here that we indicate that we be build our strength that we be determined to protect our position that we be determined to protect our commitment and then i believe we should indicate our desire to live at peace with the world but until we be strong here until we be move here i believe a summit could not be successful i hope that before we do meet there will be preliminary agreement on those four question or at least two of they or even one of they which would warrant such a meeting i think if we have stick by that position last winter we would have be in a well position in may

 mr howe we have time for only one or two more question before the closing statement now walter cronkite 's question for senator kennedy

 mr cronkite senator the charge have be make frequently that the united states for many year have be on the defensive around the world that our policy have be uh one of reaction to the soviet union rather than positive action on our own what area do you see where the united states might take the offensive in a challenge to communism over the next four to eight year

 mr kennedy one of the area and of course the most vulnerable area be i have feel have be eastern europe i have be critical of the administration 's failure to suggest policy which would make it possible for we to establish for example close relation with poland particularly after the fifty five fifty six period and the hungarian revolution we indicate at that time that we be not go to intervene militarily but there be a period there when poland demonstrate a national independence and even the polish government move some differn- di- distance away from the soviet union i suggest that we amend our legislation so that we could enjoy close economic tie we receive the support first of the administration and then not and we be defeat by one vote in the senate we pass the bill in the senate this year but it do not pass the house i would say eastern europe be the area of vulnerability of the uh s- of the soviet union secondly the relation between russia and china they be now engage in a debate over whether war be the mean of communize the world or whether they should use subversion infiltration economic struggle and all the rest no one can say what that course of action will be but i think the next president of the united states should watch it carefully if those two power should split it could have great effect throughout the entire world thirdly i believe that india represent a great area for affirmative action by the free world india start from about the same place that china do chinese communists have be move ahead the last ten year india under a free society have be make some progress but if india do not succeed with her four hundred and fifty million people if she can not make freedom work then people around the world be go to determine particularly in the underdeveloped world that the only way that they can develop their resource be through the communist system fourth let i say that in africa asia latin america eastern europe the great force on our side be the desire of people to be free this have express itself in the revolt in eastern europe it be express itself in the desire of the people of africa to be independent of western europe they want to be free and my judgment be that they do not want to give their freedom up to become communists they want to stay free independent perhaps of we but certainly independent of the communists and i believe if we identify ourselves with that force if we identify ourselves with it as lincoln as wilson do as franklin roosevelt do if we become know as the friend of freedom sustain freedom help freedom help these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease help they build their life i believe in latin america africa and asia eventually in the eastern europe and the middle east certainly in western europe we can strengthen freedom we can make it move we can put the communists on the defensive

 mr howe your comment mr. vice president

 mr nixon first with regard to poland when i talk to mr. gomulka the present leader of poland for six hour in warsaw last year i learn something about their problem and particularly his right under the soviet gun with soviet troop there he be in a very difficult position in take anything independent a position which would be independent of the soviet union and yet let us just see what we have do for poland a half a billion dollar worth of aid have go to poland primarily economic primarily to go to the people of poland this should continue and it can be step up to give they hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that i can testify they have so deeply within they in addition we can have more exchange with poland or with any other of the iron curtain country which show some desire to take a different path than the path that have be take by the one that be complete satellite of the soviet union now as far as the balance of the world be concern i of course do not have as much time as senator kennedy have i would just like to s- add this one point if we be go to have the initiative in the world we must remember that the people of africa and asia and latin america do not want to be pawn simply in a struggle between two great power the soviet union and the united states we have to let they know that we want to help they not because we be simply try to save our own skin not because we be simply try to fight communism but because we care for they because we stand for freedom because if there be no communism in the world we would still fight poverty and misery and disease and tyranny if we can get that across to the people of these country in this decade of the sixty the struggle for freedom will be win

 mr howe john chancellor 's question for vice president nixon

 mr chancellor sir i would like to ask you an- another question about quemoy and matsu both you and senator kennedy say you agree with the president on this subject and with our treaty obligation but the subject remain in the campaign as an issue now be sir be this because each of you feels oblige to respond to the other when he talk about quemoy and matsu and if that be true do you think an end should be call to this discussion or will it stay with we as a campaign issue

 mr nixon i would say that the issue will stay with we as a campaign issue just as long as senator kennedy persist in what i think be a fundamental error he say he support the president 's position he say that he vote for the resolution well just let i point this out he vote for the resolution in 1955 which give the president the power to use the force of the united states to defend formosa and the offshore island but he also vote then for an amendment which be lose fortunately an amendment which would have draw a line and leave out those island and deny the p- right to the president to defend those island if he think that it be an attack on formosa he repeat that error in 1959 in the speech that he make he repeat it again in a television debate that we have now my point be this senator kennedy have get to be consistent here either he be for the president and he be against the position that those who oppose the president in fifty five and fifty nine and the senator 's position itself state the other day in our debate either he be for the president and against that position or we simply have a disagreement here that must continue to be debate now if the senator in his answer to this question will say i now will depart or retract my previous view i think i be wrong in i 955 i think i be wrong in 1959 and i think i be wrong in our television debate to say that we should draw a line leave out quemoy and matsu draw a line in effect abandon these island to the communists then this will be right out of the campaign because there will be no issue between we i support the president 's position i have always oppose draw a line i have oppose draw a line because i know that the moment you draw a line that be an encouragement for the communists to attack to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of we want and so i would hope that senator kennedy in his answer today would clear it up it be not enough for he to say i support the president 's position that i vote for the resolution of course he vote for the resolution it be virtually unanimous but the point be what about his error in vote for the amendment which be not adopt and then persist in it in fifty nine persist in it in the debate it be very simple for he to clear it up he can say now that he no long believe that a line should be draw leave these island out of the perimeter of defense if he say that this issue will not be discuss in the campaign

 mr howe senator kennedy your comment

 mr kennedy well mr. nixon to go back to 1955 the resolution commit the president in the united states which i support to defend uh formosa the pescadores and if it be his military judgment these island then the president send a mission compose of admiral radford and mr. robertson to persuade chiang kai shek in the spring of fifty five to withdraw from the two island because they be expose the president be unsuccessful chiang kai shek would not withdraw i refer to the fact that in 1958 as a member of the senate foreign relations committee i be very familiar with the position that the united states take in negotiate with the chinese communists on these two island general twining in january fifty nine describe the position of the united states the position of the united states have be that this build up in the word of the president have be foolish mr. herter have say these island be indefensible chiang kai shek will not withdraw because he will not withdraw because he be committed to these island because we have be unable to persuade he to withdraw we be in a very difficult position and therefore the president 's judgment have be that we should defend the island if in his military judgment and the judgment of the commander in the field the attack on these island should be part of an overall attack on formosa i support that in view of the difficulty we have have with the island in view of the difficulty and dispute we have have with chiang kai shek that be the only position we can take that be not the position you take however the first position you take when this matter first come up be that we should draw the line and commit ourselves as a matter of principle to defend these island not as part of the defense of formosa and the pescadores you show no recognition of the administration program to try to persuade chiang kai shek for the last five year to withdraw from the island and i challenge you tonight to deny that the administration have send at least several mission to persuade chiang kai shek 's withdrawal from these island

 mr howe under the agree

 mr kennedy and that be the testimony of uh general twining and the assistant secretary of state in fifty eight

 mr howe under the agree rule gentleman we have exhaust the time for question each candidate will now have four minute and thirty second for his closing statement senator kennedy will make the first final closing statement

 mr kennedy i uh say that i have serve this country for fourteen year i serve it uh in the war i be devoted to it if i lose this election i will continue in the senate to try to build a strong country but i run because i believe this year the united states have a great opportunity to make a move forward to make a determination here at home and around the world that it be go to reestablish itself as a vigorous society my judgment be that the republican party have stand still here in the united states and it be also stand still around the world uh we be use about fifty percent of our steel capacity today we have a recession in fifty eight we have a recession in fifty four we be not move ahead in education the way we should we do not make a judgment in fifty seven and fifty six and fifty five and fifty four that outer space would be important if we stand still here if we appoint people to ambassadorship and position in washington who have a status quo outlook who do not recognize that this be a revolutionary time then the united states do not maintain its influence and if we fail the cause of freedom fail i believe it incumbent upon the next president of the united states to get this country move again to get our economy move ahead to set before the american people its goal its unfinished business and then throughout the world appoint the good people we can get ambassador who can speak the language no mere not merely people who make a political contribution but who can speak the language bring student here let they see what kind of a country we have mr. nixon say that we should not regard they as pawn in the cold war we should identify ourselves with they if that be true why do not we identify ourselves with the people of africa why do not we bring student over here why do we suddenly offer congo three hundred student last june when they have the tremendous revolt that be more than we have offer to all of africa before from the federal government i believe that this party republican party have stand still really for twenty five year its leadership have it oppose all of the program of president roosevelt and other the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resource the tennessee valley and all the rest and i believe that if we can get a party which believe in movement which believe in go ahead then we can reestablish our position in the world strong defense strong in economic growth justice for our people co- guarantee of constitutional right so that people will believe that we practice what we preach and then around the world particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which exist in latin america at the time of franklin roosevelt he be a good neighbor in latin america because he be a good neighbor in the united states because they see we as a society that be compassionate that care about people that be move this country ahead i believe it my responsibility as the leader of the democratic party in 1960 to try to warn the american people that in this crucial time we can no long afford to stand still we can no long afford to be second well i want people all over the world to look to the united states again to feel that we be on the move to feel that our high noon be in the future i want mr. khrushchev to know that a new generation of americans who fight in europe and italy and the pacific for freedom in world war ii have now take over in the united states and that they be go to put this country back to work again i do not believe that there be anything this country can not do i do not believe there be any burden or any responsibility that any american would not assume to protect his country to protect our security to advance the cause of freedom and i believe it incumbent upon we now to do that franklin roosevelt say in 1936 that that generation of americans have a rendezvous with destiny i believe in 1960 and sixty one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny and i believe it incumbent upon we to be the defender of the united states and the defender of freedom and to do that we must give this country leadership and we must get america move again

 mr howe now vice president nixon your closing statement

 mr nixon senator kennedy have say tonight again what he have say several time in the course of this these debate and in the campaign that american be stand still america be not stand still it have not be stand still and let us set the record straight right now by look at the record as al smith use to say he talk about housing we build more house in the last seven year than in any administration and thirty percent more than in the previous administration we talk about school three time as many classroom build in the past administration and eisenhower than under the truman administration let us talk about civil right more progress in the past eight year than in the whole eighty year before he talk about the progress in the field of slum clearance and the like we find four time as many project undertake and complete in this administration than in the previous one anybody that say america have be stand still for the last seven and a half year have not be travel in america he be be in some other country let us get that straight right away now the second point we have to understand be this however america have not be stand still but america can not stand pat we can not stand pat for the reason that we be in a race as i have indicate we can not stand pat because it be essential with the conflict that we have around the world that we not just hold our own that we not keep just freedom for ourselves it be essential that we extend freedom extend it to all the world and this mean more than what we have be do it mean keep america even strong militarily than she be it mean see that our economy move forward even fast than it have it mean make more progress in civil right than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see a democracy in action at its good now look at the other part of the world south america talk about our record and the previous one we have a good neighbor policy yes it sound fine but let us look at it there be eleven dictator when we come into power in 1953 in latin america there be only three left let us look at africa twenty new country in africa during the course of this administration not one of they select a communist government all of they vote for freedom a free type of government do this show that communism have the big pull or freedom have the big pull be i try to indicate that we have no problem in africa or latin america or asia of course not what i be try to indicate be that the tide of history 's on our side and that we can keep it on our side because we be on the right side we be on the side of freedom we be on the side of justice against the force of slavery against the force of injustice but we be not go to move america forward and we be not go to be able to lead the world to win this struggle for freedom if we have a permanent inferiority complex about american achievement because we be first in the world in space as i have indicate we be first in science we be first in education and we be go to move even far ahead with the kind of leadership that we can provide in these year ahead one other point i would make what could you do senator kennedy and i be candidate for the presidency of the united states and in the year to come it will be write that one or the other of we be elect and that he be or be not a great president what will determine whether senator kennedy or i if i be elect be a great president it will not be our ambition that will determine it because greatness be not something that be write on a campaign poster it will be determine to the extent that we represent the deep ideal the high feeling and faith of the american people in other word the next president as he lead america and the free world can be only as great as the american people be great and so i say in conclusion keep america 's faith strong see that the young people of america particularly have faith in the ideal of freedom and faith in god which distinguish we from the atheistic materialist who oppose we

 mr howe thank you gentleman both candidate have ask i to express their thank to the network for this opportunity to appear on this discussion may i repeat that all those concern in tonight 's discussion have sometimes reluctantly follow the rule and condition read at the outset and agree to in advance by the candidate and the network the opening statement run eight minute each the closing statement run four minute thirty second the order of speak be reverse from their first joint appearance when they follow the same procedure a panel of newsman question each candidate alternately each have two and a half minute to reply the other have a minute and a half to comment but the first discussion deal only with domestic policy this one deal only with foreign policy one last word as member of a new political generation vice president nixon and senator kennedy have use new mean of communication to pioneer a new type of political debate the character and courage with which these two man have speak set a high standard for generation to come surely they have set a new precedent perhaps they have establish a new tradition this be quincy howe good night from new york





i have welcome this opportunity to address this historic body and through you the people of massachusetts to whom i be so deeply indebted for a lifetime of friendship and trust
 for fourteen year i have place my confidence in the citizen of massachusetts and they have generously respond by place their confidence in i
 now on the friday after next i be to assume new and broad responsibility but i be not here to bid farewell to massachusetts
 for forty three year whether i be in london washington the south pacific or elsewhere this have be my home and god willing wherever i serve this shall remain my home
 it be here my grandparent be bear it be here i hope my grandchild will be bear
 i speak neither from false provincial pride nor artful political flattery for no man about to enter high office in this country can ever be unmindful of the contribution this state have make to our national greatness
 its leader have shape our destiny long before the great republic be bear its principle have guide our footstep in time of crisis as well as in time of calm its democratic institution include this historic body have serve as beacon light for other nation as well as our sister state
 for what pericles say to the athenians have long be true of this commonwealth we do not imitate for we be a model to other
 and so it be that i carry with i from this state to that high and lonely office to which i now succeed more than fond memory of firm friendship the endure quality of massachusetts the common thread weave by the pilgrim and the puritan the fisherman and the farmer the yankee and the immigrant will not be and could not be forget in this nation 's executive mansion
 they be an indelible part of my life my conviction my view of the past and my hope for the future
 allow i to illustrate during the last sixty day i have be at the task of construct an administration it have be a long and deliberate process some have counsel great speed other have counsel more expedient test
 but i have be guide by the standard john winthrop set before his shipmate on the flagship arbella three hundred and thirty one year ago as they too face the task of build a new government on a perilous frontier
 we must always consider he say that we shall be as a city upon a hill the eye of all people be upon we
 today the eye of all people be truly upon we and our government in every branch at every level national state and local must be as a city upon a hill construct and inhabit by man aware of their great trust and their great responsibility
 for we be set out upon a voyage in 1961 no less hazardous than that undertake by the arabella in 1630 we be commit ourselves to task of statecraft no less awesome than that of govern the massachusetts bay colony beset as it be then by terror without and disorder within
 history will not judge our endeavor and a government can not be select merely on the basis of color or creed or even party affiliation neither will competence and loyalty and stature while essential to the utmost suffice in time such as these
 for of those to whom much be give much be require and when at some future date the high court of history sit in judgment on each one of we record whether in our brief span of service we fulfil our responsibility to the state our success or failure in whatever office we may hold will be measure by the answer to four question
 first be we truly man of courage with the courage to stand up to one 's enemy and the courage to stand up when necessary to one 's associate the courage to resist public pressure as well as private greed
 secondly be we truly man of judgment with perceptive judgment of the future as well as the past of our own mistake as well as the mistake of other with enough wisdom to know that we do not know and enough candor to admit it
 third be we truly man of integrity man who never run out on either the principle in which they believe or the people who believe in they man who believe in we man whom neither financial gain nor political ambition could ever divert from the fulfillment of our sacred trust
 finally be we truly man of dedication with an honor mortgage to no single individual or group and compromise by no private obligation or aim but devote solely to serve the public good and the national interest
 courage judgment integrity dedicationthese be the historic quality of the bay colony and the bay state the quality which this state have consistently send to this chamber on beacon hill here in boston and to capitol hill back in washington
 and these be the quality which with god 's help this son of massachusetts hope will characterize our government 's conduct in the four stormy year that lie ahead
 humbly i ask his help in that undertaking but aware that on earth his will be work by man i ask for your help and your prayer as i embark on this new and solemn journey

my fellow americans

 three day from now after half a century in the service of our country i shall lay down the responsibility of office as in traditional and solemn ceremony the authority of the presidency be vest in my successor

 this evening i come to you with a message of leave taking and farewell and to share a few final thought with you my countryman

 like every other citizen i wish the new president and all who will labor with he godspeed i pray that the come year will be bless with peace and prosperity for all

 our people expect their president and the congress to find essential agreement on issue of great moment the wise resolution of which will well shape the future of the nation

 my own relation with the congress which begin on a remote and tenuous basis when long ago a member of the senate appoint i to west point have since range to the intimate during the war and immediate post war period and finally to the mutually interdependent during these past eight year

 in this final relationship the congress and the administration have on most vital issue cooperate well to serve the national good rather than mere partisanship and so have assure that the business of the nation should go forward so my official relationship with the congress end in a feeling on my part of gratitude that we have be able to do so much together

 ii

 we now stand ten year past the midpoint of a century that have witness four major war among great nation three of these involve our own country despite these holocaust america be today the strong the most influential and most productive nation in the world understandably proud of this pre eminence we yet realize that america 's leadership and prestige depend not merely upon our unmatched material progress rich and military strength but on how we use our power in the interest of world peace and human betterment

 iii

 throughout america 's adventure in free government our basic purpose have be to keep the peace to foster progress in human achievement and to enhance liberty dignity and integrity among people and among nation to strive for less would be unworthy of a free and religious people any failure traceable to arrogance or our lack of comprehension or readiness to sacrifice would inflict upon we grievous hurt both at home and abroad

 progress toward these noble goal be persistently threaten by the conflict now engulf the world it command our whole attention absorb our very being we face a hostile ideology global in scope atheistic in character ruthless in purpose and insidious in method unhappily the danger it pose promise to be of indefinite duration to meet it successfully there be call for not so much the emotional and transitory sacrifice of crisis but rather those which enable we to carry forward steadily surely and without complaint the burden of a prolonged and complex struggle with liberty the stake only thus shall we remain despite every provocation on our charted course toward permanent peace and human betterment

 crisis there will continue to be in meet they whether foreign or domestic great or small there be a recur temptation to feel that some spectacular and costly action could become the miraculous solution to all current difficulty a huge increase in new element of our defense development of unrealistic program to cure every ill in agriculture a dramatic expansion in basic and applied research these and many other possibility each possibly promise in itself may be suggest as the only way to the road we wish to travel

 but each proposal must be weigh in the light of a broad consideration the need to maintain balance in and among national program balance between the private and the public economy balance between cost and hope for advantage balance between the clearly necessary and the comfortably desirable balance between our essential requirement as a nation and the duty impose by the nation upon the individual balance between action of the moment and the national welfare of the future good judgment seek balance and progress lack of it eventually find imbalance and frustration

 the record of many decade stand as proof that our people and their government have in the main understand these truth and have respond to they well in the face of stress and threat but threat new in kind or degree constantly arise i mention two only

 iv

 a vital element in keep the peace be our military establishment our arm must be mighty ready for instant action so that no potential aggressor may be tempt to risk his own destruction

 our military organization today bear little relation to that know by any of my predecessor in peacetime or indeed by the fight man of world war ii or korea

 until the late of our world conflict the united states have no armament industry american maker of plowshare could with time and as require make sword as well but now we can no long risk emergency improvisation of national defense we have be compel to create a permanent armament industry of vast proportion add to this three and a half million man and woman be directly engage in the defense establishment we annually spend on military security more than the net income of all united states corporation

 this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arm industry be new in the american experience the total influence economic political even spiritual be feel in every city every state house every office of the federal government we recognize the imperative need for this development yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implication our toil resource and livelihood be all involve so be the very structure of our society

 in the council of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether seek or unsought by the military industrial complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplace power exist and will persist

 we must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberty or democratic process we should take nothing for grant only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful method and goal so that security and liberty may prosper together

 akin to and largely responsible for the sweeping change in our industrial military posture have be the technological revolution during recent decade

 in this revolution research have become central it also become more formalized complex and costly a steadily increase share be conduct for by or at the direction of the federal government

 today the solitary inventor tinker in his shop have be overshadow by task force of scientist in laboratory and testing field in the same fashion the free university historically the fountainhead of free idea and scientific discovery have experience a revolution in the conduct of research partly because of the huge cost involve a government contract become virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity for every old blackboard there be now hundred of new electronic computer

 the prospect of domination of the nation 's scholar by federal employment project allocation and the power of money be ever present and be gravely to be regard

 yet in hold scientific research and discovery in respect as we should we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific technological elite

 it be the task of statesmanship to mold to balance and to integrate these and other force new and old within the principle of our democratic system ever aim toward the supreme goal of our free society

 v.

 another factor in maintain balance involve the element of time as we peer into society 's future we you and i and our government must avoid the impulse to live only for today plunder for our own ease and convenience the precious resource of tomorrow we can not mortgage the material asset of our grandchild without risk the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage we want democracy to survive for all generation to come not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow

 vi

 down the long lane of the history yet to be write america know that this world of ours ever grow small must avoid become a community of dreadful fear and hate and be instead a proud confederation of mutual trust and respect

 such a confederation must be one of equal the weak must come to the conference table with the same confidence as do we protect as we be by our moral economic and military strength that table though scar by many past frustration can not be abandon for the certain agony of the battlefield

 disarmament with mutual honor and confidence be a continue imperative together we must learn how to compose difference not with arm but with intellect and decent purpose because this need be so sharp and apparent i confess that i lie down my official responsibility in this field with a definite sense of disappointment as one who have witness the horror and the linger sadness of war as one who know that another war could utterly destroy this civilization which have be so slowly and painfully build over thousand of year i wish i could say tonight that a last peace be in sight

 happily i can say that war have be avoid steady progress toward our ultimate goal have be make but so much remain to be do as a private citizen i shall never cease to do what little i can to help the world advance along that road

 vii

 so in this my last good night to you as your president i thank you for the many opportunity you have give i for public service in war and peace i trust that in that service you find some thing worthy as for the rest of it i know you will find way to improve performance in the future

 you and i my fellow citizen need to be strong in our faith that all nation under god will reach the goal of peace with justice may we be ever unswerve in devotion to principle confident but humble with power diligent in pursuit of the nation 's great goal

 to all the people of the world i once more give expression to america 's prayerful and continue aspiration

 we pray that people of all faith all race all nation may have their great human need satisfy that those now deny opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full that all who yearn for freedom may experience its spiritual blessing that those who have freedom will understand also its heavy responsibility that all who be insensitive to the need of other will learn charity that the scourge of poverty disease and ignorance will be make to disappear from the earth and that in the goodness of time all people will come to live together in a peace guarantee by the bind force of mutual respect and love

vice president johnson mr. speaker mr. chief justice president eisenhower vice president nixon president truman reverend clergy fellow citizen
 we observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom symbolize an end as well as a beginning signify renewal as well as change for i have swear before you and almighty god the same solemn oath our forebear prescribe nearly a century and three quarter ago
 the world be very different now for man hold in his mortal hand the power to abolish all form of human poverty and all form of human life and yet the same revolutionary belief for which our forebear fight be still at issue around the globe the belief that the right of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of god
 we dare not forget today that we be the heir of that first revolution let the word go forth from this time and place to friend and foe alike that the torch have be pass to a new generation of americans bear in this century temper by war discipline by a hard and bitter peace proud of our ancient heritage and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human right to which this nation have always be commit and to which we be commit today at home and around the world
 let every nation know whether it wish we well or ill that we shall pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty
 this much we pledge and more
 to those old ally whose cultural and spiritual origin we share we pledge the loyalty of faithful friend united there be little we can not do in a host of cooperative venture divide there be little we can do for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odd and split asunder
 to those new state whom we welcome to the rank of the free we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have pass away merely to be replace by a far more iron tyranny we shall not always expect to find they support our view but we shall always hope to find they strongly support their own freedom and to remember that in the past those who foolishly seek power by ride the back of the tiger end up inside
 to those people in the hut and village of half the globe struggle to break the bond of mass misery we pledge our good effort to help they help themselves for whatever period be require not because the communist may be do it not because we seek their vote but because it be right if a free society can not help the many who be poor it can not save the few who be rich
 to our sister republic south of our border we offer a special pledge to convert our good word into good deed in a new alliance for progress to assist free man and free government in cast off the chain of poverty but this peaceful revolution of hope can not become the prey of hostile power let all our neighbor know that we shall join with they to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the americas and let every other power know that this hemisphere intend to remain the master of its own house
 to that world assembly of sovereign state the united nations our last good hope in an age where the instrument of war have far outpace the instrument of peace we renew our pledge of support to prevent it from become merely a forum for invective to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run
 finally to those nation who would make themselves our adversary we offer not a pledge but a request that both side begin anew the quest for peace before the dark power of destruction unleash by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self destruction
 we dare not tempt they with weakness for only when our arm be sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employ
 but neither can two great and powerful group of nation take comfort from our present course both side overburden by the cost of modern weapon both rightly alarm by the steady spread of the deadly atom yet both race to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stay the hand of mankind 's final war
 so let we begin anew remember on both side that civility be not a sign of weakness and sincerity be always subject to proof let we never negotiate out of fear but let we never fear to negotiate
 let both side explore what problem unite we instead of belabor those problem which divide we
 let both side for the first time formulate serious and precise proposal for the inspection and control of arm and bring the absolute power to destroy other nation under the absolute control of all nation
 let both side seek to invoke the wonder of science instead of its terror together let we explore the star conquer the desert eradicate disease tap the ocean depth and encourage the art and commerce
 let both side unite to heed in all corner of the earth the command of isaiah to undo the heavy burden and let the oppressed go free
 and if a beach head of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion let both side join in create a new endeavor not a new balance of power but a new world of law where the strong be just and the weak secure and the peace preserve
 all this will not be finish in the first one hundred day nor will it be finish in the first one thousand day nor in the life of this administration nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet but let we begin
 in your hand my fellow citizen more than mine will rest the final success or failure of our course since this country be found each generation of americans have be summon to give testimony to its national loyalty the grave of young americans who answer the call to service surround the globe
 now the trumpet summon we again not as a call to bear arm though arm we need not as a call to battle though embattle we be but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle year in and year out rejoice in hope patient in tribulation"—a struggle against the common enemy of man tyranny poverty disease and war itself
 can we forge against these enemy a grand and global alliance north and south east and west that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind will you join in that historic effort
 in the long history of the world only a few generation have be grant the role of defend freedom in its hour of maximum danger i do not shrink from this responsibility i welcome it i do not believe that any of we would exchange place with any other people or any other generation the energy the faith the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it and the glow from that fire can truly light the world
 and so my fellow americans ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country
 my fellow citizen of the world ask not what america will do for you but what together we can do for the freedom of man
 finally whether you be citizen of america or citizen of the world ask of we here the same high standard of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you with a good conscience our only sure reward with history the final judge of our deed let we go forth to lead the land we love ask his blessing and his help but know that here on earth god 's work must truly be our own

mr. speaker mr. vice president members of the congress

 it be a pleasure to return from whence i come you be among my old friend in washington and this house be my old home it be here more than 14 year ago that i first take the oath of federal office it be here for 14 year that i gain both knowledge and inspiration from member of both party in both houses from your wise and generous leader and from the pronouncement which i can vividly recall sit where you now sit include the program of two great president the undimmed eloquence of churchill the soar idealism of nehru the steadfast word of general de gaulle to speak from this same historic rostrum be a sobering experience to be back among so many friend be a happy one

 i be confident that that friendship will continue our constitution wisely assign both joint and separate role to each branch of the government and a president and a congress who hold each other in mutual respect will neither permit nor attempt any trespass for my part i shall withhold from neither the congress nor the people any fact or report past present or future which be necessary for an informed judgment of our conduct and hazard i shall neither shift the burden of executive decision to the congress nor avoid responsibility for the outcome of those decision

 i speak today in an hour of national peril and national opportunity before my term have end we shall have to test anew whether a nation organize and govern such as ours can endure the outcome be by no mean certain the answer be by no mean clear all of we together this administration this congress this nation must forge those answer

 but today be i to offer after little more than a week in office detailed legislation to remedy every national ill the congress would rightly wonder whether the desire for speed have replace the duty of responsibility

 my remark therefore will be limit but they will also be candid to state the fact frankly be not to despair the future nor indict the past the prudent heir take careful inventory of his legacy and give a faithful accounting to those whom he owe an obligation of trust and while the occasion do not call for another recital of our blessing and asset we do have no great asset than the willingness of a free and determined people through its elect official to face all problem frankly and meet all danger free from panic or fear

 the present state of our economy be disturbing we take office in the wake of seven month of recession three and one half year of slack seven year of diminished economic growth and nine year of fall farm income

 business bankruptcy have reach their high level since the great depression since 1951 farm income have be squeeze down by 25 percent save for a brief period in 1958 insure unemployment be at the high peak in our history of some five and one half million americans who be without job more than one million have be search for work for more than four month and during each month some 150,000 worker be exhaust their already meager jobless benefit right

 nearly one eighth of those who be without job live almost without hope in nearly one hundred especially depressed and troubled area the rest include new school graduate unable to use their talent farmer force to give up their part time job which help balance their family budget skilled and unskilled worker lay off in such important industry as metal machinery automobile and apparel

 our recovery from the 1958 recession moreover be anemic and incomplete our gross national product never regain its full potential unemployment never return to normal level maximum use of our national industrial capacity be never restore

 in short the american economy be in trouble the most resourceful industrialized country on earth rank among the last in the rate of economic growth since last spring our economic growth rate have actually recede business investment be in a decline profit have fall below predict level construction be off a million unsold automobile be in inventory few people be work and the average work week have shrink well below 40 hour yet price have continue to rise so that now too many americans have less to spend for item that cost more to buy

 economic prophecy be at good an uncertain art as demonstrate by the prediction one year ago from this same podium that 1960 would be and i quote the most prosperous year in our history nevertheless forecast of continue slack and only slightly reduced unemployment through 1961 and 1962 have be make with alarming unanimity and this administration do not intend to stand helplessly by

 we can not afford to waste idle hour and empty plant while await the end of the recession we must show the world what a free economy can do to reduce unemployment to put unused capacity to work to spur new productivity and to foster high economic growth within a range of sound fiscal policy and relative price stability

 i will propose to the congress within the next 14 day measure to improve unemployment compensation through temporary increase in duration on a self support basis to provide more food for the family of the unemployed and to aid their needy child to redevelop our area of chronic labor surplus to expand the service of the u.s. employment offices to stimulate housing and construction to secure more purchasing power for our low pay worker by raise and expand the minimum wage to offer tax incentive for sound plant investment to increase the development of our natural resource to encourage price stability and to take other step aim at insure a prompt recovery and pave the way for increase long range growth this be not a partisan program concentrate on our weakness it be i hope a national program to realize our national strength

 efficient expansion at home stimulate the new plant and technology that can make our good more competitive be also the key to the international balance of payment problem lay aside all alarmist talk and panicky solution let we put that knotty problem in its proper perspective

 it be true that since 1958 the gap between the dollar we spend or invest abroad and the dollar return to we have substantially widen this overall deficit in our balance of payment increase by nearly $ 11 billion in the 3 year and holder of dollar abroad convert they to gold in such a quantity as to cause a total outflow of nearly $ 5 billion of gold from our reserve the 1959 deficit be cause in large part by the failure of our export to penetrate foreign market the result both of restriction on our good and our own uncompetitive price the 1960 deficit on the other hand be more the result of an increase in private capital outflow seek new opportunity high return or speculative advantage abroad

 meanwhile this country have continue to bear more than its share of the west 's military and foreign aid obligation under exist policy another deficit of $ 2 billion be predict for 1961 -and individual in those country whose dollar position once depend on these deficit for improvement now wonder aloud whether our gold reserve will remain sufficient to meet our own obligation

 all this be cause for concern but it be not cause for panic for our monetary and financial position remain exceedingly strong include our drawing right in the international monetary fund and the gold reserve hold as back for our currency and federal reserve deposit we have some $ 22 billion in total gold stock and other international monetary reserve available and i now pledge that their full strength stand behind the value of the dollar for use if need

 moreover we hold large asset abroad the total owe this nation far exceed the claim upon our reserve and our export once again substantially exceed our import

 in short we need not and we shall not take any action to increase the dollar price of gold from $ 35 an ounce to impose exchange control to reduce our anti recession effort to fall back on restrictive trade policy or to weaken our commitment around the world

 this administration will not distort the value of the dollar in any fashion and this be a commitment

 prudence and good sense do require however that new step be take to ease the payment deficit and prevent any gold crisis our success in world affair have long depend in part upon foreign confidence in our ability to pay a series of executive order legislative remedy and cooperative effort with our ally will get underway immediately aim at attract foreign investment and travel to this country promote american export at stable price and with more liberal government guarantee and financing curb tax and custom loophole that encourage undue spending of private dollar abroad and through oecd nato and otherwise share with our ally all effort to provide for the common defense of the free world and the hope for growth of the less developed land while the current deficit last way will be find to ease our dollar outlay abroad without place the full burden on the family of man whom we have ask to serve our flag overseas

 in short whatever be require will be do to back up all our effort abroad and to make certain that in the future as in the past the dollar be as sound as a dollar

 but more than our exchange of international payment be out of balance the current federal budget for fiscal 1961 be almost certain to show a net deficit the budget already submit for fiscal 1962 will remain in balance only if the congress enact all the revenue measure request and only if an early and sharp up turn in the economy than my economic adviser now think likely produce the tax revenue estimate nevertheless a new administration must of necessity build on the spending and revenue estimate already submit within that framework bar the development of urgent national defense need or a worsening of the economy it be my current intention to advocate a program of expenditure which include revenue from a stimulation of the economy will not of and by themselves unbalance the early budget

 however we will do what must be do for our national household be clutter with unfinished and neglect task our city be be engulf in squalor twelve long year after congress declare our goal to be a decent home and a suitable environment for every american family we still have 25 million americans live in substandard home a new housing program under a new housing and urban affairs department will be need this year

 our classroom contain 2 million more child than they can properly have room for teach by 90,000 teacher not properly qualified to teach one third of our most promising high school graduate be financially unable to continue the development of their talent the war baby of the 1940 's who overcrowd our school in the 1950 's be now descend in 1960 upon our college with two college student for every one ten year from now and our college be ill prepared we lack the scientist the engineer and the teacher our world obligation require we have neglect oceanography saline water conversion and the basic research that lie at the root of all progress federal grant for both high and public school education can no long be delay

 medical research have achieve new wonder but these wonder be too often beyond the reach of too many people owe to a lack of income particularly among the aged a lack of hospital bed a lack of nursing home and a lack of doctor and dentist measure to provide health care for the aged under social security and to increase the supply of both facility and personnel must be undertake this year

 our supply of clean water be dwindle organized and juvenile crime cost the taxpayer million of dollar each year make it essential that we have improve enforcement and new legislative safeguard the denial of constitutional right to some of our fellow americans on account of race at the ballot box and elsewhere disturb the national conscience and subject we to the charge of world opinion that our democracy be not equal to the high promise of our heritage morality in private business have not be sufficiently spur by morality in public business a host of problem and project in all 50 states though not possible to include in this message deserve and will receive the attention of both the congress and the executive branch on most of these matter message will be send to the congress within the next two week

 but all these problem pale when place beside those which confront we around the world no man enter upon this office regardless of his party regardless of his previous service in washington could fail to be stagger upon learn even in this brief 10 day period the harsh enormity of the trial through which we must pass in the next four year each day the crisis multiply each day their solution grow more difficult each day we draw nearer the hour of maximum danger as weapon spread and hostile force grow strong i feel i must inform the congress that our analysis over the last ten day make it clear that in each of the principal area of crisis the tide of event have be run out and time have not be our friend

 in asia the relentless pressure of the chinese communists menace the security of the entire area from the border of india and south viet nam to the jungle of laos struggle to protect its newly win independence we seek in laos what we seek in all asia and indeed in all of the world freedom for the people and independence for the government and this nation shall persevere in our pursuit of these objective in africa the congo have be brutally tear by civil strife political unrest and public disorder we shall continue to support the heroic effort of the united nations to restore peace and order effort which be now endanger by mount tension unsolved problem and decrease support from many member state

 in latin america communist agent seek to exploit that region 's peaceful revolution of hope have establish a base on cuba only 90 mile from our shore our objection with cuba be not over the people 's drive for a well life our objection be to their domination by foreign and domestic tyranny cuban social and economic reform should be encourage question of economic and trade policy can always be negotiate but communist domination in this hemisphere can never be negotiate

 we be pledge to work with our sister republic to free the americas of all such foreign domination and all tyranny work toward the goal of a free hemisphere of free government extend from cape horn to the arctic circle

 in europe our alliance be unfulfilled and in some disarray the unity of nato have be weaken by economic rivalry and partially erode by national interest it have not yet fully mobilize its resource nor fully achieve a common outlook yet no atlantic power can meet on its own the mutual problem now face we in defense foreign aid monetary reserve and a host of other area and our close tie with those whose hope and interest we share be among this nation 's most powerful asset

 our great challenge be still the world that lie beyond the cold war but the first great obstacle be still our relation with the soviet union and communist china we must never be lull into believe that either power have yield its ambition for world domination ambition which they forcefully restate only a short time ago on the contrary our task be to convince they that aggression and subversion will not be profitable route to pursue these end open and peaceful competition for prestige for market for scientific achievement even for man 's mind be something else again for if freedom and communism be to compete for man 's allegiance in a world at peace i would look to the future with ever increase confidence

 to meet this array of challenge to fulfill the role we can not avoid on the world scene we must reexamine and revise our whole arsenal of tool military economic and political

 one must not overshadow the other on the presidential coat of arms the american eagle hold in his right talon the olive branch while in his left he hold a bundle of arrow we intend to give equal attention to both

 first we must strengthen our military tool we be move into a period of uncertain risk and great commitment in which both the military and diplomatic possibility require a free world force so powerful as to make any aggression clearly futile yet in the past lack of a consistent coherent military strategy the absence of basic assumption about our national requirement and the faulty estimate and duplication arise from inter service rivalry have all make it difficult to assess accurately how adequate or inadequate our defense really be

 i have therefore instruct the secretary of defense to reappraise our entire defense strategy our ability to fulfill our commitment the effectiveness vulnerability and dispersal of our strategic basis force and warning system the efficiency and economy of our operation and organization the elimination of obsolete basis and installation and the adequacy modernization and mobility of our present conventional and nuclear force and weapon system in the light of present and future danger i have ask for preliminary conclusion by the end of february and i then shah recommend whatever legislative budgetary or executive action be need in the light of these conclusion

 in the meantime i have ask the defense secretary to initiate immediately three new step most clearly need now

 first l have direct prompt attention to increase our air lift capacity obtain additional air transport mobility and obtain it now will well assure the ability of our conventional force to respond with discrimination and speed to any problem at any spot on the globe at any moment 's notice in particular it will enable we to meet any deliberate effort to avoid or divert our force by start limited war in widely scatter part of the globe

 i have direct prompt action to step up our polaris submarine program use unobligated ship building fund now to let contract originally schedule for the next fiscal year will build and place on station at least nine month early than plan substantially more unit of a crucial deterrent a fleet that will never attack first but possess sufficient power of retaliation conceal beneath the sea to discourage any aggressor from launch an attack upon our security

 i have direct prompt action to accelerate our entire missile program until the secretary of defense 's reappraisal be complete the emphasis here will be largely on improved organization and decision making on cut down the wasteful duplication and the time lag that have handicap our whole family of missile if we be to keep the peace we need an invulnerable missile force powerful enough to deter any aggressor from even threaten an attack that he would know could not destroy enough of our force to prevent his own destruction for as i say upon take the oath of office only when our arm be sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employ

 secondly we must improve our economic tool our role be essential and unavoidable in the construction of a sound and expand economy for the entire non communist world help other nation build the strength to meet their own problem to satisfy their own aspiration to surmount their own danger the problem in achieve this goal be tower and unprecedented the response must be tower and unprecedented as well much as lend lease and the marshall plan be in early year which bring such fruitful result

 i intend to ask the congress for authority to establish a new and more effective program for assist the economic educational and social development of other country and continent that program must stimulate and take more effectively into account the contribution of our ally and provide central policy direction for all our own program that now so often overlap conflict or diffuse our energy and resource such a program compare to past program will require

 --more flexibility for short run emergency

 --more commitment to long term development --new attention to education at all level --greater emphasis on the recipient nation 's role their effort their purpose with great social justice for their people broad distribution and participation by their people and more efficient public administration and more efficient tax system of their own

 --and orderly planning for national and regional development instead of a piecemeal approach

 i hope the senate will take early action approve the convention establish the organization for economic cooperation and development this will be an important instrument in share with our ally this development effort work toward the time when each nation will contribute in proportion to its ability to pay for while we be prepared to assume our full share of these huge burden we can not and must not be expect to bear they alone

 to our sister republic to the south we have pledge a new alliance for progress alianza para progreso our goal be a free and prosperous latin america realize for all its state and all its citizen a degree of economic and social progress that match their historic contribution of culture intellect and liberty to start this nation 's role at this time in that alliance of neighbor i be recommend the following

 --that the congress appropriate in full the $ 500 million fund pledge by the act of bogota to be use not as an instrument of the cold war but as a first step in the sound development of the americas

 --that a new inter departmental task force be establish under the leadership of the department of state to coordinate at the high level all policy and program of concern to the americas
 --that our delegate to the oas work with those of other member strengthen that body as an instrument to preserve the peace and to prevent foreign domination anywhere in the hemisphere

 --that in cooperation with other nation we launch a new hemispheric attack on illiteracy and inadequate educational opportunity to all level and finally

 --that a food for peace mission be send immediately to latin america to explore way in which our vast food abundance can be use to help end hunger and malnutrition in certain area of suffer in our own hemisphere

 this administration be expand its food for peace program in every possible way the product of our abundance must be use more effectively to relieve hunger and help economic growth in all corner of the globe and i have ask the director of this program to recommend additional way in which these surplus can advance the interest of world peace include the establishment of world food reserve

 an even more valuable national asset be our reservoir of dedicated man and woman not only on our college campus but in every age group who have indicate their desire to contribute their skill their effort and a part of their life to the fight for world order we can mobilize this talent through the formation of a national peace corps enlist the service of all those with the desire and capacity to help foreign land meet their urgent need for train personnel

 finally while our attention be center on the development of the noncommunist world we must never forget our hope for the ultimate freedom and welfare of the eastern european people in order to be prepared to help re establish historic tie of friendship i be ask the congress for increase discretion to use economic tool in this area whenever this be find to be clearly in the national interest this will require amendment of the mutual defense assistance control act along the line i propose as a member of the senate and upon which the senate vote last summer meanwhile i hope to explore with the polish government the possibility of use our frozen polish fund on project of peace that will demonstrate our abide friendship for and interest in the people of poland

 third we must sharpen our political and diplomatic tool the mean of cooperation and agreement on which an enforceable world order must ultimately rest

 i have already take step to coordinate and expand our disarmament effort to increase our program of research and study and to make arm control a central goal of our national policy under my direction the deadly arm race and the huge resource it absorb have too long overshadow all else we must do we must prevent that arm race from spread to new nation to new nuclear power and to the reach of outer space we must make certain that our negotiator be well informed and well prepare to formulate workable proposal of our own and to make sound judgment about the proposal of other

 i have ask the other government concerned to agree to a reasonable delay in the talk on a nuclear test ban and it be our intention to resume negotiation prepare to reach a final agreement with any nation that be equally willing to agree to an effective and enforceable treaty

 we must increase our support of the united nations as an instrument to end the cold war instead of an arena in which to fight it in recognition of its increase importance and the doubling of its membership

 --we be enlarging and strengthen our own mission to the u.n.

 --we shall help insure that it be properly finance

 --we shall work to see that the integrity of the office of the secretary general be maintain

 --and i would address a special plea to the small nation of the world to join with we in strengthen this organization which be far more essential to their security than it be to ours the only body in the world where no nation need be powerful to be secure where every nation have an equal voice and where any nation can exert influence not accord to the strength of its army but accord to the strength of its idea it deserve the support of all

 finally this administration intend to explore promptly all possible area of cooperation with the soviet union and other nation to invoke the wonder of science instead of its terror specifically i now invite all nation include the soviet union to join with we in develop a weather prediction program in a new communication satellite program and in preparation for probe the distant planet of mars and venus probe which may someday unlock the deep secret of the universe

 today this country be ahead in the science and technology of space while the soviet union be ahead in the capacity to lift large vehicle into orbit both nation would help themselves as well as other nation by ten move these endeavor from the bitter and wasteful competition of the cold war the united states would be willing to join with the soviet union and the scientist of all nation in a great effort to make the fruit of this new knowledge available to all and beyond that in an effort to extend farm technology to hungry nation to wipe out disease to increase the exchange of scientist and their knowledge and to make our own laboratory available to technician of other land who lack the facility to pursue their own work where nature make natural ally of we all we can demonstrate that beneficial relation be possible even with those with whom we most deeply disagree and this must someday be the basis of world peace and world law

 i have comment on the state of the domestic economy our balance of payment our federal and social budget and the state of the world i would like to conclude with a few remark about the state of the executive branch we have find it full of honest and useful public servant but their capacity to act decisively at the exact time action be need have too often be muffle in the morass of committee timidity and fictitious theory which have create a grow gap between decision and execution between planning and reality in a time of rapidly deteriorate situation at home and abroad this be bad for the public service and particularly bad for the country and we mean to make a change

 i have pledge myself and my colleague in the cabinet to a continuous encouragement of initiative responsibility and energy in serve the public interest let every public servant know whether his post be high or low that a man 's rank and reputation in this administration will be determine by the size of the job he do and not by the size of his staff his office or his budget let it be clear that this administration recognize the value of dissent and daring that we greet healthy controversy as the hallmark of healthy change let the public service be a proud and lively career and let every man and woman who work in any area of our national government in any branch at any level be able to say with pride and with honor in future year i serve the united states government in that hour of our nation 's need

 for only with complete dedication by we all to the national interest can we bring our country through the troubled year that lie ahead our problem be critical the tide be unfavorable the news will be bad before it be well and while hope and work for the good we should prepare ourselves now for the bad

 we can not escape our danger neither must we let they drive we into panic or narrow isolation in many area of the world where the balance of power already rest with our adversary the force of freedom be sharply divided it be one of the irony of our time that the technique of a harsh and repressive system should be able to instill discipline and ardor in its servants-- while the blessing of liberty have too often stand for privilege materialism and a life of case

 but i have a different view of liberty

 life in 1961 will not be easy wish it predict it even ask for it will not make it so there will be further setback before the tide be turn but turn it we must the hope of all mankind rest upon we not simply upon those of we in this chamber but upon the peasant in laos the fisherman in nigeria the exile from cuba the spirit that move every man and nation who share our hope for freedom and the future and in the final analysis they rest most of all upon the pride and perseverance of our fellow citizen of the great republic

 in the word of a great president whose birthday we honor today close his final state of the union message sixteen year ago we pray that we may be worthy of the unlimited opportunity that god have give we

lady and gentlemen mr. secretary

 i want to express my great appreciation at the opportunity to be here with you and to express my thank to all of you for having attend this conference

 i ask those member of the cabinet who feel they be physically fit to come here today and i be delighted that mr. udall and mr. robert kennedy and governor ribicoff respond to the challenge

 some year ago another president of the united states who be also interested in physical fitness mr. theodore roosevelt express some ambition that i think member of the armed service would improve their physical fitness as there be some question about his you will recall that he then ride a horse for a hundred mile

 we do not have to prove it in 1961 we take it for grant that the member of the administration be all physically fit and our presence here today be an effort to encourage all of you in your work

 since the time of the ancient greeks we have always feel that there be a close relationship between a strong vital mind and physical fitness it be our hope that use the influence of the national government that we can expand this strong spirit among american man and woman that they will concern themselves with this phase of their personal development

 we do not want in the united states a nation of spectator we want a nation of participant in the vigorous life this be not a matter which can be settle of course from washington it be really a matter which start with each individual family it be my hope that mother and father stretch across the united states will be concern about this phase of their child 's development that the community will be concern to make it possible for young boy and girl to participate actively in the physical life and that man and woman who have reach the age of maturity will concern themselves with maintain their own participation in this phase of national vigor national life

 i be hopeful that we can develop here today with your help and suggestion a program which will inspire our country to be concern i do not think we have to read these test which we have see so much of during the last 10 year to realize that because of the generosity of nature because of the way our society be organize that there have be less emphasis on national vigor national vitality physical well being than there have be in many other country of the world

 i want to do well and i think you want to do well we want to make sure that as our life become more sophisticated as we become more urbanized that we do not lose this very valuable facet of our national character physical vitality which be tie into quality of character which be tie into quality of intellectual vigor and vitality

 so i think that you be perform a real service in be here we want your suggestion and idea this have to flow two way and we want the flow today to come from you to tell we how you think we can use the influence of the national government its prestige in order to increase the emphasis which we can place in every community across the country in every home in this most important program

 i be particularly glad that we have here today teacher from over 67 country who have be teach in the united states and travel through it and who have now come to the national capital before they return home i hope they realize how much we learn from they this be a two way street and all of these program which have bring hundred of teacher in the last 15 to 20 year which have bring they to all part of the country that each of you leave behind you an understanding of the problem and opportunity of your country your culture your civilization what you believe and by your look at we we see something of ourselves

 this be a program which we benefit from in many way i think we be the great beneficiary and i hope that when you go back to your country that you will tell they something of what we be try to do here you will tell they though we may not always realize our high ambition and our high goal that nevertheless we be attempt to advance ourselves and that there be tremendous interest in what be go on in the world around we

 during the fall i speak as many member of congress have speak about a peace corps i be hopeful that it will be possible to bring that into realization but what have be most interesting have be the great response of young man and woman who desire not merely to serve the united states but who desire to serve the cause of freedom which be common i think to all country and to all people

 i hope that when the peace corps ultimately be organize and young man and woman go out around the world that they will place their great emphasis on teaching and secondly that they will learn themselves far more than they will teach and that we will therefore have another link which bind we to the world around we

 i want to express my thank to all of you whether you come from across the sea or here in the united states we be all involve in this great effort together and therefore i wish you well i express my thank to all of you i want you to know that we here in washington be intimately concerned with the matter in which you be engage
 thank you

i have today sign an executive order provide for the establishment of a peace corps on a temporary pilot basis i be also send to congress a message propose authorization of a permanent peace corps this corps will be a pool of train american man and woman send overseas by the u.s. government or through private institution and organization to help foreign country meet their urgent need for skilled manpower
 it be our hope to have 500 or more people in the field by the end of the year the initial reaction to the peace corps proposal be convincing proof that we have in this country an immense reservoir of such man and woman anxious to sacrifice their energy and time and toil to the cause of world peace and human progress
 in establish our peace corps we intend to make full use of the resource and talent of private institution and group university voluntary agency labor union and industry will be ask to share in this effort contribute diverse source of energy and imagination make it clear that the responsibility for peace be the responsibility of our entire society
 we will only send abroad americans who be want by the host country who have a real job to do and who be qualified to do that job program will be develop with care and after full negotiation in order to make sure that the peace corps be want and will contribute to the welfare of other people our peace corps be not design as an instrument of diplomacy or propaganda or ideological conflict it be design to permit our people to exercise more fully their responsibility in the great common cause of world development
 life in the peace corps will not be easy there will be no salary and allowance will be at a level sufficient only to maintain health and meet basic need man and woman will be expect to work and live alongside the national of the country in which they be station do the same work eat the same food talk the same language
 but if the life will not be easy it will be rich and satisfying for every young american who participate in the peace corps who work in a foreign land will know that he or she be share in the great common task of bring to man that decent way of life which be the foundation of freedom and a condition of peace

it be a great pleasure for mrs. kennedy and for i for the vice president and mrs. johnson and for the members of congress to welcome the ambassadorial corps of our hemisphere our long time friend to the white house today one hundred and thirty nine year ago this week the united states stir by the heroic struggle of its fellow americans urge the independence and recognition of the new latin american republics it be then at the dawn of freedom throughout this hemisphere that bolivar speak of his desire to see the americas fashion into the great region in the world great he say not so much by virtue of her area and her wealth as by her freedom and her glory

 never in the long history of our hemisphere have this dream be near to fulfillment and never have it be in great danger

 the genius of our scientist have give we the tool to bring abundance to our land strength to our industry and knowledge to our people for the first time we have the capacity to strike off the remain bond of poverty and ignorance to free our people for the spiritual and intellectual fulfillment which have always be the goal of our civilization

 yet at this very moment of maximum opportunity we confront the same force which have imperil america throughout its history the alien force which once again seek to impose the despotism of the old world on the people of the new

 i have ask you to come here today so that i might discuss these challenge and these danger

 we meet together as firm and ancient friend unite by history and experience and by our determination to advance the value of american civilization for this new world of our be not a mere accident of geography our continent be bind together by a common history the endless exploration of new frontier our nation be the product of a common struggle the revolt from colonial rule and our people share a common heritage the quest for the dignity and the freedom of man

 the revolution which give we birth ignite in the word of thomas paine a spark never to be extinguish and across vast turbulent continent these american ideal still stir man 's struggle for national independence and individual freedom but as we welcome the spread of the american revolution to other land we must also remember that our own struggle the revolution which begin in philadelphia in 1776 and in caracas in 1811 -is not yet finish our hemisphere 's mission be not yet complete for our unfulfilled task be to demonstrate to the entire world that man 's unsatisfied aspiration for economic progress and social justice can well be achieve by free man work within a framework of democratic institution if we can do this in our own hemisphere and for our own people we may yet realize the prophecy of the great mexican patriot benito juarez that democracy be the destiny of future humanity

 as a citizen of the united states let i be the first to admit that we north americans have not always grasp the significance of this common mission just as it be also true that many in your own country have not fully understand the urgency of the need to lift people from poverty and ignorance and despair but we must turn from these mistake from the failure and the misunderstanding of the past to a future full of peril but bright with hope

 throughout latin america a continent rich in resource and in the spiritual and cultural achievement of its people million of man and woman suffer the daily degradation of poverty and hunger they lack decent shelter or protection from disease their child be deprive of the education or the job which be the gateway to a well life and each day the problem grow more urgent population growth be outpace economic growth low living standard be far endanger and discontent the discontent of a people who know that abundance and the tool of progress be at last within their reach that discontent be grow in the word of jose figueres once dormant people be struggle upward toward the sun toward a well life

 if we be to meet a problem so staggering in its dimension our approach must itself be equally bold an approach consistent with the majestic concept of operation pan america therefore i have call on all people of the hemisphere to join in a new alliance for progress alianza para progreso a vast cooperative effort unparalleled in magnitude and nobility of purpose to satisfy the basic need of the american people for home work and land health and school techo trabajo y tierra salud y escuela

 first i propose that the american republics begin on a vast new ten year plan for the americas a plan to transform the 1960 's into a historic decade of democratic progress

 these 10 year will be the year of maximum progress maximum effort the year when the great obstacle must be overcome the year when the need for assistance will be the great

 and if we be successful if our effort be bold enough and determine enough then the close of this decade will mark the beginning of a new era in the american experience the live standard of every american family will be on the rise basic education will be available to all hunger will be a forget experience the need for massive outside help will have pass most nation will have enter a period of self sustain growth and though there will be still much to do every american republic will be the master of its own revolution and its own hope and progress

 let i stress that only the most determined effort of the american nation themselves can bring success to this effort they and they alone can mobilize their resource enlist the energy of their people and modify their social pattern so that all and not just a privileged few share in the fruit of growth if this effort be make then outside assistance will give vital impetus to progress without it no amount of help will advance the welfare of the people

 thus if the country of latin america be ready to do their part and i be sure they be then i believe the united states for its part should help provide resource of a scope and magnitude sufficient to make this bold development plan a success just as we help to provide against equal odd nearly the resource adequate to help rebuild the economy of western europe for only an effort of tower dimension can ensure fulfillment of our plan for a decade of progress

 secondly i will shortly request a ministerial meeting of the inter american economic and social council a meeting at which we can begin the massive planning effort which will be at the heart of the alliance for progress

 for if our alliance be to succeed each latin nation must formulate long range plan for its own development plan which establish target and priority ensure monetary stability establish the machinery for vital social change stimulate private activity and initiative and provide for a maximum national effort these plan will be the foundation of our development effort and the basis for the allocation of outside resource

 a greatly strengthen ia ecosoc work with the economic commission for latin america and the inter american development bank can assemble the lead economist and expert of the hemisphere to help each country develop its own development plan and provide a continue review of economic progress in this hemisphere

 third i have this evening sign a request to the congress for $ 500 million as a first step in fulfil the act of bogota this be the first large scale inter american effort institute by my predecessor president eisenhower to attack the social barrier which block economic progress the money will be use to combat illiteracy improve the productivity and use of their land wipe out disease attack archaic tax and land tenure structure provide educational opportunity and offer a broad range of project design to make the benefit of increase abundance available to all we will begin to commit these fund as soon as they be appropriate

 fourth we must support all economic integration which be a genuine step toward large market and great competitive opportunity the fragmentation of latin american economy be a serious barrier to industrial growth project such as the central american common market and free trade area in south america can help to remove these obstacle

 fifth the united states be ready to cooperate in serious case by case examination of commodity market problem frequent violent change in commodity price seriously injure the economy of many latin american country drain their resource and stultify their growth together we must find practical method of bring an end to this pattern

 sixth we will immediately step up our food for peace emergency program help establish food reserve in area of recurrent drought help provide school lunch for child and offer feed grain for use in rural development for hungry man and woman can not wait for economic discussion or diplomatic meeting their need be urgent and their hunger rest heavily on the conscience of their fellow man

 seventh all the people of the hemisphere must be allow to share in the expand wonder of science wonder which have capture man 's imagination challenge the power of his mind and give he the tool for rapid progress i invite latin american scientist to work with we in new project in field such as medicine and agriculture physics and astronomy and desalinization to help plan for regional research laboratory in these and other field and to strengthen cooperation between american university and laboratory

 we also intend to expand our science teacher training program to include latin american instructor to assist in establish such program in other american country and translate and make available revolutionary new teaching material in physics chemistry biology and mathematic so that the young of all nation may contribute their skill to the advance of science

 eighth we must rapidly expand the training of those need to man the economy of rapidly develop country this mean expand technical training program for which the peace corps for example will be available when need it also mean assistance to latin american university graduate school and research institute

 we welcome proposal in central america for intimate cooperation in high education cooperation which can achieve a regional effort of increase effectiveness and excellence we be ready to help fill the gap in train manpower realize that our ultimate goal must be a basic education for all who wish to learn

 ninth we reaffirm our pledge to come to the defense of any american nation whose independence be endanger as its confidence in the collective security system of the oas spread it will be possible to devote to constructive use a major share of those resource now spend on the instrument of war even now as the government of chile have say the time have come to take the first step toward sensible limitation of arm and the new generation of military leader have show an increase awareness that army can not only defend their country they can as we have learn through our own corps of engineers they can help to build they

 tenth we invite our friend in latin america to contribute to the enrichment of life and culture in the united states we need teacher of your literature and history and tradition opportunity for our young people to study in your university access to your music your art and the thought of your great philosopher for we know we have much to learn

 in this way you can help bring a full spiritual and intellectual life to the people of the united states and contribute to understanding and mutual respect among the nation of the hemisphere

 with step such as these we propose to complete the revolution of the americas to build a hemisphere where all man can hope for a suitable standard of living and all can live out their life in dignity and in freedom

 to achieve this goal political freedom must accompany material progress our alliance for progress be an alliance of free government and it must work to eliminate tyranny from a hemisphere in which it have no rightful place therefore let we express our special friendship to the people of cuba and the dominican republic and the hope they will soon rejoin the society of free man unite with we in common effort

 this political freedom must be accompany by social change for unless necessary social reform include land and tax reform be freely make unless we broaden the opportunity for all of our people unless the great mass of americans share in increase prosperity then our alliance our revolution our dream and our freedom will fail but we call for social change by free man change in the spirit of washington and jefferson of bolivar and san martin and martin not change which seek to impose on man tyranny which we cast out a century and a half ago our motto be what it have always be progress yes tyranny no progreso si tirania no

 but our great challenge come from within the task of create an american civilization where spiritual and cultural value be strengthen by an ever broaden base of material advance where within the rich diversity of its own tradition each nation be free to follow its own path towards progress

 the completion of our task will of course require the effort of all government of our hemisphere but the effort of government alone will never be enough in the end the people must choose and the people must help themselves

 and so i say to the man and woman of the americas to the campesino in the field to the obrero in the city to the estudiante in the school prepare your mind and heart for the task ahead call forth your strength and let each devote his energy to the betterment of all so that your child and our child in this hemisphere can find an ever rich and a free life

 let we once again transform the american continent into a vast crucible of revolutionary idea and effort a tribute to the power of the creative energy of free man and woman an example to all the world that liberty and progress walk hand in hand let we once again awaken our american revolution until it guide the struggle of people everywhere not with an imperialism of force or fear but the rule of courage and freedom and hope for the future of man

mr. catledge member of the american society of newspaper editor lady and gentleman

 the president of a great democracy such as ours and the editor of great newspaper such as your owe a common obligation to the people an obligation to present the fact to present they with candor and to present they in perspective it be with that obligation in mind that i have decide in the last 24 hour to discuss briefly at this time the recent event in cuba

 on that unhappy island as in so many other arena of the contest for freedom the news have grow bad instead of well i have emphasize before that this be a struggle of cuban patriot against a cuban dictator while we could not be expect to hide our sympathy we make it repeatedly clear that the armed force of this country would not intervene in any way

 any unilateral american intervention in the absence of an external attack upon ourselves or an ally would have be contrary to our tradition and to our international obligation but let the record show that our restraint be not inexhaustible should it ever appear that the inter american doctrine of non interference merely conceal or excuse a policy of nonaction if the nation of this hemisphere should fail to meet their commitment against outside communist penetration then i want it clearly understand that this government will not hesitate in meet its primary obligation which be to the security of our nation

 should that time ever come we do not intend to be lecture on intervention by those whose character be stamp for all time on the bloody street of budapest nor would we expect or accept the same outcome which this small band of gallant cuban refugee must have know that they be chance determined as they be against heavy odd to pursue their courageous attempt to regain their island 's freedom

 but cuba be not an island unto itself and our concern be not end by mere expression of nonintervention or regret this be not the first time in either ancient or recent history that a small band of freedom fighter have engage the armor of totalitarianism

 it be not the first time that communist tank have roll over gallant man and woman fight to redeem the independence of their homeland nor be it by any mean the final episode in the eternal struggle of liberty against tyranny anywhere on the face of the globe include cuba itself

 mr. castro have say that these be mercenary accord to press report the final message to be relay from the refugee force on the beach come from the rebel commander when ask if he wish to be evacuate his answer be i will never leave this country that be not the reply of a mercenary he have go now to join in the mountain countless other guerrilla fighter who be equally determined that the dedication of those who give their life shall not be forget and that cuba must not be abandon to the communists and we do not intend to abandon it either

 the cuban people have not yet speak their final piece and i have no doubt that they and their revolutionary council lead by dr. cardona and member of the family of the revolutionary council i be inform by the doctor yesterday be involve themselves in the islands will continue to speak up for a free and independent cuba

 meanwhile we will not accept mr. castro 's attempt to blame this nation for the hatred which his onetime supporter now regard his repression but there be from this sobering episode useful lesson for we all to learn some may be still obscure and await further information some be clear today

 first it be clear that the force of communism be not to be underestimate in cuba or anywhere else in the world the advantage of a police state its use of mass terror and arrest to prevent the spread of free dissent cannot be overlook by those who expect the fall of every fanatic tyrant if the self discipline of the free can not match the iron discipline of the mail fist in economic political scientific and all the other kind of struggle as well as the military then the peril to freedom will continue to rise

 secondly it be clear that this nation in concert with all the free nation of this hemisphere must take an ever close and more realistic look at the menace of external communist intervention and domination in cuba the american people be not complacent about iron curtain tank and plane less than 90 mile from their shore but a nation of cuba 's size be less a threat to our survival than it be a base for subvert the survival of other free nation throughout the hemisphere it be not primarily our interest or our security but theirs which be now today in the great peril it be for their sake as well as our own that we must show our will

 the evidence be clear and the hour be late we and our latin friend will have to face the fact that we can not postpone any long the real issue of survival of freedom in this hemisphere itself on that issue unlike perhaps some other there can be no middle ground together we must build a hemisphere where freedom can flourish and where any free nation under outside attack of any kind can be assure that all of our resource stand ready to respond to any request for assistance

 third and finally it be clear than ever that we face a relentless struggle in every corner of the globe that go far beyond the clash of army or even nuclear armament the army be there and in large number the nuclear armament be there but they serve primarily as the shield behind which subversion infiltration and a host of other tactic steadily advance pick off vulnerable area one by one in situation which do not permit our own armed intervention

 power be the hallmark of this offensive power and discipline and deceit the legitimate discontent of yearn people be exploit the legitimate trapping of self determination be employ but once in power all talk of discontent be repressed all self determination disappear and the promise of a revolution of hope be betray as in cuba into a reign of terror those who on instruction stage automatic riot in the street of free nation over the effort of a small group of young cubans to regain their freedom should recall the long roll call of refugee who can not now go back to hungary to north korea to north viet nam to east germany or to poland or to any of the other land from which a steady stream of refugee pour forth in eloquent testimony to the cruel oppression now hold sway in their homeland

 we dare not fail to see the insidious nature of this new and deep struggle we dare not fail to grasp the new concept the new tool the new sense of urgency we will need to combat it whether in cuba or south viet nam and we dare not fail to realize that this struggle be take place every day without fanfare in thousand of village and market day and night and in classroom all over the globe

 the message of cuba of laos of the rise din of communist voice in asia and latin america these message be all the same the complacent the self indulgent the soft society be about to be sweep away with the debris of history only the strong only the industrious only the determined only the courageous only the visionary who determine the real nature of our struggle can possibly survive

 no great task face this country or this administration no other challenge be more deserving of our every effort and energy too long we have fix our eye on traditional military need on army prepare to cross border on missile poise for flight now it should be clear that this be no long enough that our security may be lose piece by piece country by country without the firing of a single missile or the crossing of a single border

 we intend to profit from this lesson we intend to reexamine and reorient our force of all kind our tactic and our institution here in this community we intend to intensify our effort for a struggle in many way more difficult than war where disappointment will often accompany we

 for i be convinced that we in this country and in the free world possess the necessary resource and the skill and the add strength that come from a belief in the freedom of man and i be equally convinced that history will record the fact that this bitter struggle reach its climax in the late 1950 's and the early 1960 's let i then make clear as the president of the united states that i be determine upon our system 's survival and success regardless of the cost and regardless of the peril

mr. chairman lady and gentleman
  i appreciate very much your generous invitation to be here tonight
  you bear heavy responsibility these day and an article i read some time ago remind i of how particularly heavily the burden of present day event bear upon your profession
  you may remember that in 1851 the new york herald tribune under the sponsorship and publishing of horace greeley employ as its london correspondent an obscure journalist by the name of karl marx
  we be tell that foreign correspondent marx stone break and with a family ill and undernourished constantly appeal to greeley and managing editor charles dana for an increase in his munificent salary of $ 5 per installment a salary which he and engels ungratefully label as the lousy petty bourgeois cheating
  but when all his financial appeal be refuse marx look around for other mean of livelihood and fame eventually terminate his relationship with the tribune and devote his talent full time to the cause that would bequeath to the world the seed of leninism stalinism revolution and the cold war
  if only this capitalistic new york newspaper have treat he more kindly if only marx have remain a foreign correspondent history might have be different and i hope all publisher will bear this lesson in mind the next time they receive a poverty stricken appeal for a small increase in the expense account from an obscure newspaper
  i have select as the title of my remark tonight the president and the press some may suggest that this would be more naturally word the president versus the press but those be not my sentiment tonight
  it be true however that when a well know diplomat from another country demand recently that our state department repudiate certain newspaper attack on his colleague it be unnecessary for we to reply that this administration be not responsible for the press for the press have already make it clear that it be not responsible for this administration
  nevertheless my purpose here tonight be not to deliver the usual assault on the so call one party press on the contrary in recent month i have rarely hear any complaint about political bias in the press except from a few republicans nor be it my purpose tonight to discuss or defend the televising of presidential press conference i think it be highly beneficial to have some 20 million americans regularly sit in on these conference to observe if i may say so the incisive the intelligent and the courteous quality display by your washington correspondent
  nor finally be these remark intend to examine the proper degree of privacy which the press should allow to any president and his family
  if in the last few month your white house reporter and photographer have be attend church service with regularity that have surely do they no harm
  on the other hand i realize that your staff and wire service photographer may be complain that they do not enjoy the same green privilege at the local golf course which they once do
  it be true that my predecessor do not object as i do to picture of one 's golf skill in action but neither on the other hand do he ever bean a secret service man my topic tonight be a more sober one of concern to publisher as well as editor
  i want to talk about our common responsibility in the face of a common danger the event of recent week may have help to illuminate that challenge for some but the dimension of its threat have loom large on the horizon for many year whatever our hope may be for the future for reduce this threat or live with it there be no escape either the gravity or the totality of its challenge to our survival and to our security a challenge that confront we in unaccustomed way in every sphere of human activity
  this deadly challenge impose upon our society two requirement of direct concern both to the press and to the president two requirement that may seem almost contradictory in tone but which must be reconcile and fulfil if we be to meet this national peril i refer first to the need for far great public information and second to the need for far great official secrecy
  the very word secrecy be repugnant in a free and open society and we be as a people inherently and historically oppose to secret society to secret oath and to secret proceeding we decide long ago that the danger of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent fact far outweigh the danger which be cite to justify it even today there be little value in oppose the threat of a closed society by imitate its arbitrary restriction even today there be little value in insure the survival of our nation if our tradition do not survive with it and there be very grave danger that an announce need for increase security will be seize upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limit of official censorship and concealment that i do not intend to permit to the extent that it be in my control and no official of my administration whether his rank be high or low civilian or military should interpret my word here tonight as an excuse to censor the news to stifle dissent to cover up our mistake or to withhold from the press and the public the fact they deserve to know
  but i do ask every publisher every editor and every newsman in the nation to reexamine his own standard and to recognize the nature of our country 's peril in time of war the government and the press have customarily join in an effort base largely on self discipline to prevent unauthorized disclosure to the enemy in time of clear and present danger the court have hold that even the privileged right of the first amendment must yield to the public 's need for national security
  today no war have be declare and however fierce the struggle may be it may never be declare in the traditional fashion our way of life be under attack those who make themselves our enemy be advance around the globe the survival of our friend be in danger and yet no war have be declare no border have be cross by march troop no missile have be fire
  if the press be await a declaration of war before it impose the self discipline of combat condition then i can only say that no war ever pose a great threat to our security if you be await a finding of clear and present danger then i can only say that the danger have never be more clear and its presence have never be more imminent
  it require a change in outlook a change in tactic a change in mission by the government by the people by every businessman or labor leader and by every newspaper for we be oppose around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that rely primarily on covert mean for expand its sphere of influence on infiltration instead of invasion on subversion instead of election on intimidation instead of free choice on guerrilla by night instead of army by day it be a system which have conscript vast human and material resource into the building of a tightly knit highly efficient machine that combine military diplomatic intelligence economic scientific and political operation
  its preparation be conceal not publish its mistake be bury not headline its dissenter be silence not praise no expenditure be question no rumor be print no secret be reveal it conduct the cold war in short with a war time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match
  nevertheless every democracy recognize the necessary restraint of national security and the question remain whether those restraint need to be more strictly observe if we be to oppose this kind of attack as well as outright invasion
  for the fact of the matter be that this nation 's foe have openly boast of acquire through our newspaper information they would otherwise hire agent to acquire through theft bribery or espionage that detail of this nation 's covert preparation to counter the enemy 's covert operation have be available to every newspaper reader friend and foe alike that the size the strength the location and the nature of our force and weapon and our plan and strategy for their use have all be pinpoint in the press and other news medium to a degree sufficient to satisfy any foreign power and that in at least one case the publication of detail concern a secret mechanism whereby satellite be follow require its alteration at the expense of considerable time and money
  the newspaper which print these story be loyal patriotic responsible and well meaning have we be engage in open warfare they undoubtedly would not have publish such item but in the absence of open warfare they recognize only the test of journalism and not the test of national security and my question tonight be whether additional test should not now be adopt
  that question be for you alone to answer no public official should answer it for you no governmental plan should impose its restraint against your will but i would be fail in my duty to the nation in consider all of the responsibility that we now bear and all of the mean at hand to meet those responsibility if i do not commend this problem to your attention and urge its thoughtful consideration
  on many early occasion i have say and your newspaper have constantly say that these be time that appeal to every citizen 's sense of sacrifice and self discipline they call out to every citizen to weigh his right and comfort against his obligation to the common good i can not now believe that those citizen who serve in the newspaper business consider themselves exempt from that appeal
  i have no intention of establish a new office of war information to govern the flow of news i be not suggest any new form of censorship or new type of security classification i have no easy answer to the dilemma that i have pose and would not seek to impose it if i have one but i be ask the member of the newspaper profession and the industry in this country to reexamine their own responsibility to consider the degree and the nature of the present danger and to heed the duty of self restraint which that danger impose upon we all
  every newspaper now ask itself with respect to every story be it news all i suggest be that you add the question be it in the interest of the national security and i hope that every group in america union and businessman and public official at every level will ask the same question of their endeavor and subject their action to this same exacting test
  and should the press of america consider and recommend the voluntary assumption of specific new step or machinery i can assure you that we will cooperate whole heartedly with those recommendation
  perhaps there will be no recommendation perhaps there be no answer to the dilemma face by a free and open society in a cold and secret war in time of peace any discussion of this subject and any action that result be both painful and without precedent but this be a time of peace and peril which know no precedent in history
  it be the unprecedented nature of this challenge that also give rise to your second obligation an obligation which i share and that be our obligation to inform and alert the american people to make certain that they possess all the fact that they need and understand they as well the peril the prospect the purpose of our program and the choice that we face
  no president should fear public scrutiny of his program for from that scrutiny come understand and from that understanding come support or opposition and both be necessary i be not ask your newspaper to support the administration but i be ask your help in the tremendous task of inform and alert the american people for i have complete confidence in the response and dedication of our citizen whenever they be fully inform
  i not only could not stifle controversy among your reader i welcome it this administration intend to be candid about its error for as a wise man once say an error do not become a mistake until you refuse to correct it we intend to accept full responsibility for our error and we expect you to point they out when we miss they
  without debate without criticism no administration and no country can succeed and no republic can survive that be why the athenian law maker solon decree it a crime for any citizen to shrink from controversy and that be why our press be protect by the first amendment the only business in america specifically protect by the constitution not primarily to amuse and entertain not to emphasize the trivial and the sentimental not to simply give the public what it wants"—but to inform to arouse to reflect to state our danger and our opportunity to indicate our crisis and our choice to lead mold educate and sometimes even anger public opinion
  this mean great coverage and analysis of international news for it be no long far away and foreign but close at hand and local it mean great attention to improved understanding of the news as well as improve transmission and it mean finally that government at all level must meet its obligation to provide you with the full possible information outside the narrow limit of national security and we intend to do it
  it be early in the seventeenth century that francis bacon remark on three recent invention already transform the world the compass gunpowder and the printing press now the link between the nation first forge by the compass have make we all citizen of the world the hope and threat of one become the hope and threat of we all in that one world 's effort to live together the evolution of gunpowder to its ultimate limit have warn mankind of the terrible consequence of failure
  and so it be to the printing press to the recorder of man 's deed the keeper of his conscience the courier of his news that we look for strength and assistance confident that with your help man will be what he be bear to be free and independent
to the congress of the united states

 a strong and sound federal tax system be essential to america 's future without such a system we can not maintain our defense and give leadership to the free world without such a system we can not render the public service necessary for enrich the life of our people and further the growth of our economy

 the tax system must be adequate to meet our public need it must meet they fairly call on each of we to contribute his proper share to the cost of government it must encourage efficient use of our resource it must promote economic stability and stimulate economic growth economic expansion in turn create a grow tax base thus increase revenue and thereby enable we to meet more readily our public need as well as our need as private individual

 a strong and sound federal tax system be essential to america 's future without such a system we can not maintain our defense and give leadership to the free world without such a system we can not render the public service necessary for enrich the life of our people and further the growth of our economy

 the tax system must be adequate to meet our public need it must meet they fairly call on each of we to contribute his proper share to the cost of government it must encourage efficient use of our resource it must promote economic stability and stimulate economic growth economic expansion in turn create a grow tax base thus increase revenue and thereby enable we to meet more readily our public need as well as our need as private individual

 this message recognize the basic soundness of our tax structure but it also recognize the change need and standard of our economic and international position and the constructive reform need to keep our tax system up to date and to maintain its equity previous message have emphasize the need for prompt congressional and executive action to alleviate the deficit in our international balance of payment to increase the modernization productivity and competitive status of american industry to stimulate the expansion and growth of our economy to eliminate to the extent possible economic injustice within our own society and to maintain the level of revenue request in my predecessor 's budget in each of these endeavor tax policy have an important role to play and necessary tax change be herein propose

 the elimination of certain defect and inequity as propose below will provide revenue gain to offset the tax reduction offer to stimulate the economy thus no net loss of revenue be involve in this set of proposal i wish to emphasize here that they be a set"--and that consideration of both revenue and equity as well as the interrelationship of many of the proposal urge their consideration as a unit

 i be instruct the secretary of the treasury to furnish the committee on ways and means of the house a detailed explanation of these proposal in connection with their legislative consideration

 i. long range tax reform

 while it be essential that the congress receive at this time this administration 's proposal for urgent and obvious tax adjustment need to fulfill the aim list above time have not permit the comprehensive review necessary for a tax structure which be so complicated and so critically important to so many people this message be but a first though urgent step along the road to constructive reform

 i be direct the secretary of the treasury build on recent tax study of the congress to undertake the research and preparation of a comprehensive tax reform program to be place before the next session of the congress

 progress from these study particularly those of the committee on ways and means and the joint economic committee the program should be aim at provide a broad and more uniform tax base together with an appropriate rate structure we can thereby work toward the goal of a high rate of economic growth a more equitable tax structure and a simple tax law i know these objective be share by and at this particular time of year acutely desire by the vast majority of the american people

 in meet the demand of war finance the individual income tax move from a selective tax impose on the wealthy to the mean by which the great majority of our citizen participate in pay for well over one half of our total budget receipt it be supplement by the corporation income tax which provide for another quarter of the total

 this emphasis on income taxation have be a sound development but so many taxpayer have become so preoccupied with so many tax save device that business decision be interfere with and the efficient functioning of the price system be distort

 moreover special provision have develop into an increase source of preferential treatment to various group whenever one taxpayer be permit to pay less someone else must be ask to pay more the uniform distribution of the tax burden be thereby disturb and high rate be make necessary by the narrowing of the tax base of course some departure from uniformity be need to promote desirable social or economic objective of override importance which can be achieve most effectively through the tax mechanism but many of the preference which have develop do not meet such a test and need to be reevaluate in our tax reform program

 it will be a major aim of our tax reform program to reverse this process by broaden the tax base and reconsider the rate structure the result should be a tax system that be more equitable more efficient and more conducive to economic growth

 ii tax incentive for modernization and expansion

 the history of our economy have be one of rise productivity base on improvement in skill advance in technology and a grow supply of more efficient tool and equipment this rise have be reflect in rise wage and standard of live for our worker as well as a healthy rate of growth for the economy as a whole it have also be the foundation of our leadership in world market even as we enjoy the high wage rate in the world

 today as we face serious pressure on our balance of payment position we must give special attention to the modernization of our plant and equipment force to reconstruct after wartime devastation our friend abroad now possess a modern industrial system help to make they formidable competitor in world market if our own good be to compete with foreign good in price and quality both at home and abroad we shall need the most efficient plant and equipment

 at the same time to meet the need of a grow population and labor force and to achieve a rise per capita income and employment level we need a high and rise level of both private and public capital formation in my precede message i have propose program to meet some of our need for such capital formation in the public area include investment in intangible capital such as education and research as well as investment in physical capital such as building and highway i be now propose additional incentive for the modernization and expansion of private plant and equipment

 inevitably capital expansion and modernization now frequently under the name of automation alter establish mode of production great benefit result and be distribute widely but some hardship result as well this place heavy responsibility on public policy not to retard modernization and capital expansion but to promote growth and ameliorate hardship when they do occur to maintain a high level of demand and employment so that those who be displace will be reabsorb quickly into new position and to assist in retrain and find new job for such displace worker we be develop through such measure as the area redevelopment bill and a strengthen employment service as well as assistance to the unemployed the program design to achieve these objective

 high capital formation can be sustain only by a high and rise level of demand for good and service indeed the investment incentive itself can contribute materially to achieve the prosperous economy under which this incentive will make its maximum contribution to economic growth rather than delay its adoption until all excess capacity have disappear and unemployment be low we should take this step now to strengthen our anti recession program stimulate employment and increase our export market

 additional expenditure on plant and equipment will immediately create more job in the construction lumber steel cement machinery and other relate capital good industry the staffing of these new plant and fill the order for new export market will require additional employee the additional wage of these worker will help create still more job in consumer good and service industry the increase in job result from a full year 's operation of such an incentive be estimate at about half a million

 specifically therefore i recommend enactment of an investment tax incentive in the form of a tax credit of

 --15 of all new plant and equipment investment expenditure in excess of current depreciation allowance

 --6 of such expenditure below this level but in excess of 50 of depreciation allowance with

 --10 on the first $ 5,000 of new investment as a minimum credit

 this credit would be take as an offset against the firm 's tax liability up to an overall limitation of 30 in the reduction of that liability in any one year it would be separate from and in addition to depreciation of the eligible new investment at cost it would be available to individually own business as well as corporate enterprise and apply to eligible investment expenditure make after january 1 of this year to remain a real incentive and make a maximum contribution to those area of capital expansion and modernization where it be most need and to permit efficient administration eligible investment expenditure would be limit to expenditure on new plant and equipment on asset locate in .the united states and on asset with a life of six year or more investment by public utility other than transportation would be exclude as would be investment in residential construction include apartment and hotel

 of the eligible firm it be expect that many small firm would be able to take advantage of the minimum credit of 10 on the first $ 5000 of new investment which be design to provide a helpful stimulus to the many small business in need of modernization other small firm subject to a 30 tax rate would strive to be eligible for the full 15 credit the equivalent for such firm of a deduction from their gross income for tax purpose of 50 of the cost of new investment among the remain firm it be expect that a majority would be induce to make new investment in modern plant and equipment in excess of their depreciation in order to earn the 15 credit new and grow firm would be particularly benefit the 6 credit for those whose new investment expenditure fall between 50 and 100 of their depreciation allowance be design to afford some substantial incentive to the depressed or hesitant firm which know it can not yet achieve the 15 credit

 in arrive at this form of tax encouragement to investment careful consideration be give to other alternative if the credit be give across the board to all new investment a much large revenue loss would result from those expenditure which would have be undertake anyway or represent no new level of effort our objective be to provide the large possible inducement to new investment which would not otherwise be undertake thus the plan recommend above would involve the same revenue loss approximately $ 1.7 billion as only a 7 percent credit across the board to all new investment

 the use of current depreciation allowance as the threshold above which the high rate of credit would apply recommend itself for a number of reason depreciation reflect the average level of investment over the past but be a less restrictive and more stable test than the use of an average of investment expenditure for a period such as the precede five year in addition the depreciation allowance themselves in effect supply tax free fund for investment up to this level we now propose a tax credit which would help to secure fund need for the additional investment beyond that level

 the propose credit in term of the revenue loss involve will also be much more effective as an inducement to investment than an outright reduction in the rate of corporation income tax its benefit would be distribute more broadly since the propose credit will apply to individual and partnership as well as corporation it will also be more effective as a direct incentive to corporate investment and increase available fund more specifically in those corporation most likely to use they for additional investment in short whereas the credit will have the advantage of focus on the profitability of new investment much of the revenue loss under a general corporate rate reduction would be divert into raise the profitability of old investment

 it be true that this advantage of focus entirely on new investment be share by the alternative strongly urge by some a tax change permit more rapid depreciation of new asset be it accelerate depreciation or an additional depreciation allowance for the first year but the propose investment credit would be superior in my view for a number of reason in the first place the determination of the length of an asset 's life and proper method of depreciation have a normal and important function in determine taxable income wholly apart from any consideration of incentive and they should not be alter or manipulate for other purpose that would interfere with this function it may be that on examination some of the exist depreciation rule will be find to be outmoded and inequitable but that be a question that should be separate from investment incentive a review of these rule and method be underway in the treasury department as a part of its overall tax reform study to determine whether change be appropriate and if so what form they should take adoption of the propose incentive credit would in no way foreclose late action on these aspect of depreciation

 in the second place an increase in tax depreciation tend to be record in the firm 's account thereby raise current cost and act as a deterrent to price reduction the propose investment credit would not share this defect

 finally it be clear that the tax credit would be more effective in induce new investment for the same revenue loss the entire credit would be reflect immediately in the increase fund available for investment without increase the company 's future tax liability a speed up in depreciation only postpone the timing of the tax liability on profit from the investment to a later date an increase in profitability not comparable to that of an outright tax credit yet accelerate depreciation be much more costly in immediate revenue

 for example on an average investment a tax credit of 15 would bring the same return to the firm as an additional first year depreciation of over 50 of the cost of the investment yet the immediate revenue loss to the treasury from such additional depreciation would be twice as much and would remain considerably high for many year the incentive to new investment our economy need and which this recommendation would provide at a revenue loss of $ 1.7 billion could be supply by an initial write off only at an immediate cost of $ 3.4 billion

 i believe this investment tax credit will become a useful and continuous part of our tax structure but it will be a new venture and remain in need of review moreover it may prove desirable for the congress to modify the credit from time to time so as to adapt it to the need of a change economy i strongly urge its adoption in this session

 iii tax treatment of foreign income

 change economic condition at home and abroad the desire to achieve great equity in taxation and the strain which have develop in our balance of payment position in the last few year compel we to examine critically certain feature of our tax system which in conjunction with the tax system of other country consistently favor united states private investment abroad compare with investment in our own economy

 1 elimination of tax deferral privilege in develop country and tax haven deferral privilege in all country profit earn abroad by american firm operate through foreign subsidiary be under present tax law subject to united states tax only when they be return to the parent company in the form of dividend in some case this tax deferral have make possible indefinite postponement of the united states tax and in those country where income taxis be low than in the united states the ability to defer the payment of u.s. tax by retain income in the subsidiary company provide a tax advantage for company operate through overseas subsidiary that be not available to company operate solely in the united states many american investor properly make use of this deferral in the conduct of their foreign investment though change condition now make continuance of the privilege undesirable such change of policy imply no criticism of the investor who so utilize this privilege

 the undesirability of continue deferral be underscore where deferral have serve as a shelter for tax escape through the unjustifiable use of tax haven such as switzerland recently more and more enterprise organize abroad by american firm have arrange their corporate structure aid by artificial arrangement between parent and subsidiary regard intercompany pricing the transfer of patent licensing right the shifting of management fee and similar practice which maximize the accumulation of profit in the tax haven so as to exploit the multiplicity of foreign tax system and international agreement in order to reduce sharply or eliminate completely their tax liability both at home and abroad

 to the extent that these tax haven and other tax deferral privilege result in u.s. firm invest or locate abroad largely for tax reason the efficient allocation of international resource be upset the initial drain on our already adverse balance of payment be never fully compensate and profit be retain and reinveste abroad which would otherwise be invest in the united states certainly since the postwar reconstruction of europe and japan have be complete there be no long foreign policy reason for provide tax incentive for foreign investment in the economically advanced country

 if we be seek to curb tax haven if we recognize that the stimulus of tax deferral be no long need for investment in the develop country and if we be to emphasize investment in this country in order to stimulate our economy and our plant modernization as well as ease our balance of payment deficit we can no long afford exist tax treatment of foreign income

 i therefore recommend that legislation be adopt which would after a two step transitional period tax each year american corporation on their current share of the undistributed profit realize in that year by subsidiary corporation organize in economically advanced country this current taxation would also apply to individual shareholder of closely hold corporation in those country since income taxis pay abroad be properly a credit against the united states income tax this would subject the income from such business activity to essentially the same tax rate as business activity conduct in the united states to permit firm to adjust their operation to this change i also recommend that this result be achieve in equal step over a two year period under which only one half of the profit would be affect during 1962 where the foreign taxis pay have be close to the u.s. rate the impact of this change would be small

 this proposal will maintain united states investment in the develop country at the level justify by market force american enterprise abroad will continue to compete with foreign firm with their access to capital market at home and abroad their advanced technical know how their energy resourcefulness and many other advantage american firm will continue to occupy their rightful place in the market of the world while the rate of expansion of some american business operation abroad may be reduce through the withdrawal of tax deferral such reduction would be consistent with the efficient distribution of capital resource in the world our balance of payment need and fairness to compete firm locate in our own country

 at the same time i recommend that tax deferral be continue for income from investment in the develop economy the free world have a strong obligation to assist in the development of these economy and private investment have an important contribution to make continue income tax deferral for these area will be helpful in this respect in addition the propose elimination of income tax deferral on united states earning in industrialize country should enhance the relative attraction of investment in the less developed country

 on the other hand i recommend elimination of the tax haven device anywhere in the world even in the underdeveloped country through the elimination of tax deferral privilege for those form of activity such as trading licensing insurance and other that typically seek out tax haven method of operation there be no valid reason to permit their remain untaxed regardless of the country in which they be locate

 2 taxation of foreign investment companies for some year now we have witness substantial outflow of capital from the united states into investment company create abroad whose principal justification lie in the tax benefit which their method of operation produce i recommend that these tax benefit be remove and that income derive through such foreign investment company be treat in substantially the same way as income from domestic investment company

 3 taxation of american citizens abroad it be no more justifiable to provide tax exemption for individual live in the develop country than it be to provide tax inducement for capital investment there nor should we permit totally unjustified tax benefit to be obtain by those americans whose choice of residence be dictate primarily by their desire to minimize taxis

 i therefore recommend

 --that the total tax exemption now accord the earn income of american citizen reside abroad be completely terminate for those reside in economically advanced country

 --that this exemption for earn income be limit to $ 20,000 for those reside in the less developed country and

 --that the exemption of $ 20,000 of earn income now accord those citizen who stay but do not reside abroad for 17 out of 18 month also be completely terminate for those live or travel in the economically advanced country

 4 estate tax on property located abroad i recommend that the exclusion from the estate tax accord real property situate abroad be terminate with the adoption several year ago of the credit for foreign taxis under the estate tax there be no justification for the continue exemption of such property

 5 allowance for foreign tax on dividend finally the method by which the credit for foreign income taxis be compute in the case of dividend involve a double allowance for foreign income taxis and should be correct

 these proposal along with more detailed and technical change need to improve the taxation of foreign income be expect to reduce substantially our balance of payment deficit and to increase revenue by at least $ 250 million per year

 iv correction of other structural defect

 i next recommend a number of measure to remove other serious defect in the income tax structure these change while make a beginning toward the comprehensive tax reform program mention above will provide sufficient revenue gain to offset the cost of the investment tax credit and keep the revenue produce potential of our tax structure intact

 1 withhold on interest and dividend our system of combined withholding and voluntary reporting on wage and salary under the individual income tax have serve we well introduce during the war when the income tax be extend to million of new taxpayer the wage withholding system have be one of the most important and successful advance in our tax system in recent time initial difficulty be quickly overcome and the new system help the taxpayer no less than the tax collector

 it be the more unfortunate therefore that the application of the withholding principle have remain incomplete withholding do not apply to dividend and interest with the result that substantial amount of such income particularly interest improperly escape taxation it be estimate that about $ 3 billion of taxable interest and dividend be unreporte each year this be patently unfair to those who must as a result bear a large share of the tax burden re cipient of dividend and interest should pay their tax no less than those who receive wage and salary income and the tax should be pay just as promptly large continued avoidance of tax on the part of some have a steadily demoralize effect on the compliance of other

 this gap in reporting have not be appreciably lessen by educational program nor can it be effectively close by intensify enforcement measure except by the expenditure of inordinate amount of time and money withhold on corporate dividend and on investment type interest such as interest pay on taxable government and corporate security and saving account be both necessary and practicable

 i therefore recommend the enactment of legislation to provide for a 20 withholding rate on corporate dividend and taxable investment type interest effective january 1 1962 under a system which would not require the preparation of withholding statement to be send to recipient it would thus place a relatively light burden of compliance on the payer of interest and dividend certainly less than that place on payer of wage and salary while at the same time largely solve the compliance problem for most of the taxpayer receive dividend and interest step will also be take to avoid hardship for recipient who be not subject to tax

 the remain need for compliance largely in the high income group subject to a high tax rate would be meet through the concentration of enforcement device on taxpayer in these bracket introduction of equipment for the automatic processing of information return would be especially helpful for this purpose and would thus supplement the extension of withholding

 enactment of this proposal be estimate to increase revenue by $ 600 million per year

 2 repeal of the dividend credit and exclusion the present law provide for an exclusion from income of the first $ 50 of dividend receive from domestic corporation and for a 4 credit against tax of such dividend income in excess of $ 50 these provision be enact in 1954 proponent argue that they would encourage capital formation through equity investment and that they would provide a partial offset to the so call double taxation of dividend income it be now clear that they serve neither purpose well and i therefore recommend the repeal of both the dividend credit and exclusion

 the dividend credit and exclusion be not an efficient stimulus to capital expansion in the form of plant and equipment the revenue loss result from these provision be spread over a large volume of outstanding share rather than be concentrate on new share and the stimulating effect of the provision be thus greatly dilute result in relatively little increase in the supply of equity fund and a relatively slight reduction in the cost of equity financing in fact such reduction as do occur be more likely to benefit large corporation with easy access to the capital market while be of little use to small firm which be not so favorably situate insofar as raise the profitability of new investment in plant and equipment be concern the tax investment credit propose above would be far more effective since it be offer to the corporation where the actual investment decision be make

 the dividend credit and exclusion be equally inadequate as a solution to the so call problem of double taxation whatever may be the merit of the argument respect the existence of double taxation the provision of the 1954 act clearly do not offer an appropriate remedy they greatly overcompensate the dividend recipient in the high income bracket while give either insufficient or no relief to shareholder with small income

 this point deserve emphasis for view simply as a means of tax reduction the dividend credit be wholly inequitable the distribution of its benefit be highly favorable to the taxpayer in the upper income group who receive the major part of dividend income only about 10 percent of dividend income accrue to those with income below $ 5,000 about 80 percent of it accrue to that 6.5 of taxpayer whose income exceed $ 10,000 a year similarly dividend income be a sharply rise fraction of total income as we move up the income scale thus dividend income be about 1 percent of all income from all source for those taxpayer with income of $ 3,000 to $ 5,000 but it constitute more than 25 percent of the income for those with $ 100,000 to $ 150,000 of income and about 50 percent for those with income over $ 1,000,000

 the role of the dividend credit should not be confuse with the broad question of tax rate applicable to high income these high rate deserve re examination and this be one of the problem which will be examine in the context of next year 's tax reform but if top bracket rate be to be reduce the dividend credit be not the way to do it rate reduction if appropriate should apply no less to those with high income from other source such as professional and salaried people whose tax position be particularly difficult today

 if the credit be eliminate the $ 50 exclusion should also be discard for similar reason the tax saving from the exclusion be substantially great for a dividend recipient with a high income than for a recipient with low income moreover on equity ground there be no reason for give tax reduction to that small fraction of low income tax payer who receive dividend in contrast to those who must live on wage interest rent or other form of income

 the 1954 formula therefore be a dead end and should be rescind effective december 31 of this year the estimate revenue gain be $ 450 million per year

 3 expense accounts in recent year widespread abuse have develop through the use of the expense account too many firm and individual have devise mean of deduct too many personal living expense as business expense thereby charge a large part of their cost to the federal government indeed expense account living have become a byword in the american scene

 this be a matter of national concern affect not only our public revenue our sense of fairness and our respect for the tax system but our moral and business practice as well this widespread distortion of our business and social structure be largely a creature of the tax system and the time have come when our tax law should cease their encouragement of luxury spending as a charge on the federal treasury the slogan--"it 's deductible"--should pass from our scene

 tighter enforcement of present legislation will not suffice even though in some instance entertainment and relate expense have an association with the need of business they nevertheless confer substantial tax free personal benefit to the recipient in other case deduction be obtain by disguise personal expense as business outlay but under present law it be extremely difficult to separate out and disallow such pseudo business expenditure new legislation be need to deal with the problem

 i therefore recommend that the cost of such business entertainment and the maintenance of entertainment facility such as yacht and hunt lodge be disallow in full as a tax deduction and that restriction be impose on the deductibility of business gift expense of business trip combine with vacation and excessive personal living expense incur on business travel away from home

 i feel confident that these measure will be welcome by the american people i be also confident that business firm now force to emulate the expense account favor of their competitor however unsound or uneconomical such practice may be will welcome the removal of this pressure these measure will strengthen both our tax structure and the moral fibre of our society these provision should be effective as of january 1 1962 and be estimate to increase treasury receipt by at least $ 250 million per year

 4 capital gains on sale of depreciable business property another flaw which should be correct at this time relate to the taxation of gain on the sale of depreciable business property such gain be now tax at the preferential rate applicable to capital gain even though they represent ordinary income

 this situation arise because the statutory rate of depreciation may not coincide with the actual decline in the value of the asset while the taxpayer hold the property depreciation be take as a deduction from ordinary income upon its resale where the amount of depreciation allowable exceed the decline in the actual value of the asset so that a gain occur this gain under present law be tax at the preferential capital gain rate the advantage result from this practice have be increase by the liberalization of depreciation rate

 our capital gain concept should not encompass this kind of income this inequity should be eliminate and especially so in view of the propose investment credit we should not encourage through tax incentive the further acquisition of such property as long as this loophole remain

 i therefore recommend that capital gain treatment be withdraw from gain on the disposition of depreciable property both personal and real property to the extent that depreciation have be deduct for such property by the seller in previous year permit only the excess of the sale price over the original cost to be treat as a capital gain the remainder should be treat as ordinary income this reform should immediately become effective as to all sale take place after the date of enactment it be estimate to raise revenue by $ 200 million annually

 5 cooperative and financial institutions another area of the tax law which call for attention be the treatment of cooperative private lending institution and fire and casualty insurance company

 contrary to the intention of congress substantial income from certain cooperative enterprise reflect business operation be not be tax either to the cooperative organization itself or its member this situation must be correct in a manner that be fair and just to both the cooperative and compete business

 the present inequity have result from court decision which hold patronage refund in certain form to be non taxable i recommend that the law be clarify so that all earning be taxable to either the cooperative or to their patron assess the patron on the earning that be allocate to he as patronage dividend or refund in scrip or cash the withholding principle recommend above should also be apply to patronage dividend or refund so that the average patron receive scrip will in effect be give the cash to pay his tax on his patronage dividend or refund the cooperative should not be penalize by the assessment of a patronage tax upon dividend or refund taxable to the patron but leave in the business as a substitute for the sale of security to obtain additional equity capital the exemption for rural electric cooperative and credit union should be continue

 the tax provision applicable to fire and casualty insurance company originally adopt in 1942 need to be review in the light of current condition many of these company organize on the mutual or reciprocal basis be now tax under a special formula which do not take account of their underwriting gain and thus result in an inequitable distribution of the tax burden among various type of company consideration should be give to tax mutual or reciprocal company on a basis similar to stock company follow the pattern of similar treatment of stock and mutual enterprise in the life insurance field

 some of the most important type of private saving and lending institution in the country be accord tax deductible reserve provision which substantially reduce or eliminate their federal income tax liability these provision should be review with the aim of assure non discriminatory treatment

 remedial legislation in these field would enlarge the revenue and contribute to a fair and sound tax structure

 v. tax administration

 one of the major characteristic of our tax system and one in which we can take a great deal of pride be that it operate primarily through individual self assessment the integrity of such a system depend upon the continue willingness of the people honestly and accurately to discharge this annual price of citizenship to the extent that some people be dishonest or careless in their dealing with the government the majority be force to carry a heavy tax burden

 for voluntary serf assessment to be both meaningful and productive of revenue the citizen must not only have confidence in the fairness of the tax law but also in their uniform and vigorous enforcement of these law if non compliance by the few continue unchecked the confidence of the many in our self assessment system will be shake and one of the cornerstone of our government weaken

 i have in this message already recommend the application of withholding to dividend and interest and revision to halt the abuse of expense account these measure will improve taxpayer compliance and raise the regard of taxpayer for the fairness of our system in addition i propose three further measure to improve the tax enforcement machinery

 1 taxpayer account numbers the internal revenue service have begin the installation of automatic datum processing equipment to improve administration of the grow job of tax collection and enforcement a system of identify taxpayer account number which would make possible the bringing together of all tax datum for any one particular taxpayer be an essential part of such an improved collection and enforcement program

 for this purpose social security number would be use by taxpayer already have they the small minority currently without such number would be assign number which these person could later use as well for social security purpose if need the number would be enter on tax return information return and relate document

 i recommend that legislation be enact to authorize the use of taxpayer account number begin january 1 1962 to identify taxpayer account throughout the processing and record keeping operation of the internal revenue service

 2 increase audit coverage the examination of tax return be the essence of the enforcement process the number of examine personnel of the internal revenue service however have be consistently inadequate to cope with the audit workload consequently it have be unable to audit carefully many of the return which should be so examined anticipated growth in our population will of course increase this enforcement problem

 relate to broaden tax audit be the criminal enforcement program of the revenue service here the guide principle be the creation of a deterrent to tax evasion and to maintain or if possible increase voluntary compliance with all tax statute this mean place an appropriate degree of investigative emphasis on all type of tax violation in all geographical area and identify violation of substance in all income bracket regardless of occupation business or profession

 within this framework of a balanced enforcement effort the service be place special investigative emphasis on return file by person receive income from illegal source i have direct all federal law enforcement agency to cooperate fully with the attorney general in a drive against organized crime and to utilize their resource to the maximum extent in conduct investigation of individual engage in criminal activity on a major scale with the foregoing in mind i have direct the secretary of the treasury to provide through the internal revenue service a maximum effort in this field

 to fulfill these requirement for improved audits enforcement and anti crime investigation it be essential that the service be provide additional resource which will pay their own cost many time over in further the service 's long range plan the prior administration ask additional appropriation of $ 27.4 million to hire about 3,500 additional personnel during fiscal 1962 include provision for the necessary increase in space and modern equipment vital to the efficient operation of the service to meet the commitment describe above this administration review these proposal and recommend that they be increase by another $ 7 million and 765 additional personnel to expedite the expansion and criminal enforcement program the pende alternative of only 1,995 additional personnel or less than one half of the number request this administration would constitute little more than the additional employee need each year during the 1960 's just to keep up with the estimate growth in number and complexity of return file thus i must again strongly urge the congress to give its full support to my original request these increase will safeguard the long term adequacy of the nation 's traditional voluntary compliance system and at the same time return the add appropriation several time over in add revenue

 3 inventory reporting it be increasingly apparent that the manipulation of inventory have become a frequent method of avoid taxis current law and regulation generally permit the use of inventory method which be acceptable in recognize accounting practice deviation from these method which be not always easy to detect during examination of tax return can often lead to complete non payment of taxis until the inventory be liquidate and for some taxpayer this represent permanent tax reduction the understating of the valuation of inventory be the device most fiequently use

 i have direct the internal revenue service to give increase attention to this area of tax avoidance through a step up emphasis on both the verification of the amount report as inventory and an examination of method use in arrive at their report valuation

 vi tax rate extension

 as recommend by my predecessor it be again necessary that congress enact an extension of present corporation income and excise tax rate otherwise schedule for reduction or termination on july 1 1961 such extension have be adopt by the congress on a number of previous occasion and our present revenue requirement make such extension absolutely necessary again this year

 in the absence of such legislation the corporate tax rate would be decrease 5 percentage point from 52 percent to 47 percent excise tax rate on distil spirit beer wine cigarette passenger automobile automobile part and accessory and the transportation of person would also decline and the excise tax on general telephone service would expire we can not afford the loss of these revenue at this time

 vii aviation fuel

 the last item on the agenda relate to aviation fuel the two previous administration have urge that civil aviation a mature and grow industry be require to pay a fair share of the cost of operate and improve the federal airway system the rapidly mount cost of these essential service to air transportation make the imposition of user charge more imperative now than ever before the most efficient method for recover a portion of these cost equitably from the airway user be through a tax on aviation fuel present law provide for a net tax of 2 cent a gallon on aviation gasoline but no tax on jet fuel the freedom from tax of jet fuel be inequitable and be result in substantial revenue loss due to the transition to jet power and the result decline in gasoline consumption

 my predecessor recommend a flat 41/2 cent tax for both aviation gasoline and jet fuel such a request however appear to be unrealistic in view of the current financial condition of the airline industry therefore i recommend

 --extending the present net 2 cent rate on aviation gasoline to jet fuel

 --holde this uniform rate cover both type of fuel at the 2 cent level for fiscal 1962 and

 --providing for annual increment in this rate of 1/2 cent after fiscal year 1962 until the portion of the cost of the airway properly allocable to civil aviation be substantially recover by this tax

 the immediate increase in revenue from this proposal be modest in comparison with anticipated airway cost and the annual gradation of further increase be intend to moderate the impact of the tax on the air carrier industry should future economic or other development warrant a more rapid increase in the fuel tax will be recommend the decline from the revenue estimate by my predecessor be not large and will be meet by the reform previously propose i repeat my early recommendation that consistent with the user charge principle revenue from the aviation fuel tax be retain in the general fund rather than divert to the highway trust fund

 conclusion

 the legislation recommend in this message offer a first step toward the broad objective of tax reform the immediate need be for encourage economic growth through modernization and capital expansion and to remove tax preference for foreign investment which be no long need and which impair our balance of payment position a beginning be make also toward remove some of the more glaring defect in the tax structure the revenue gain in these proposal will offset the revenue cost of the investment credit finally certain rate extension be need to maintain the revenue potential of our fiscal system

 these item need to be do now but they be a first step only they will be follow next year by a second set of proposal aim at thorough income tax reform their purpose will be to broaden and unify the income tax base and to review the entire rate structure in the light of these revision let we join in solve these immediate problem in the come month and then join in further action to strengthen the foundation of our revenue system



mr. president

 i want to express my appreciation to the president and to the fellow of this university for the honor that they have bestow upon i my wife beat i to this honor by about 8 or 9 year it take she 2 year to get this degree and it take i 2 minute but in any case we be both grateful

 i be also glad to be here because this university bear the distinguished name of the father of our country george washington it be a matter of great interest that there have be an intimate relationship between the great political leader of our country and our college and university

 this university bear the name of george washington which show his understanding in his day of the necessity of a free society to produce educate man and woman john adams and john quincy adams from my own state of massachusetts have an intimate relationship with harvard university both of they i believe be member of the board of overseer in both of their life harvard and its development play a major part

 washington and lee show an intimate relationship for general lee the fact that he be willing to devote his life at the end of the war to educate the man and woman of the south indicate his understanding of this basic precept woodrow wilson theodore roosevelt and all the rest

 i do not think that there have ever be a time when we have have great need for those quality which a university produce i know that many people feel that a democracy be a divide system that where the communists be certain in purpose and certain in execution we debate and talk and be unable to meet their consistency and their perseverance

 i do not hold that view there be many disadvantage which a free society bear with it in a cold war struggle but i believe over the long run that people do want to be free that they desire to develop their own personality and their own potential that democracy permit they to do so and that it be the job of school and college such as this to provide the man and woman who will with their sense of discipline and purpose and understanding contribute to the maintenance of free society here and around the world

 a hundred year ago george william curtis of my own state ask a body of educator during the kansas nebraska controversy would you have count he a friend of ancient greece who quietly discuss the theory of patriotism on that hot summer day through whose hopeless and immortal hour leonidas and the three hundred stand at thermopylae for liberty be john milton to conjugate greek verb in his library when the liberty of englishmen be imperil no quite obviously the duty of the educate man or woman the duty of the scholar be to give his objective sense his sense of liberty to the maintenance of our society at a critical time

 this be our opportunity as well as our responsibility and i be particularly glad to be here today when we be witness the swearing in of a new president many year ago as most of you know at harvard university somebody come around and ask for president lowell they say he be in washington see mr. taft i know that some other day when they be ask for the president of your university they will say that he be over at the white house see mr. kennedy
 they understand at harvard and you understand here the relative importance of a university president and a president of the united states
 thank you

mr. speaker of the senate mr. speaker of the house mr. prime minister members of the canadian houses of parliament distinguished guest and friend

 i be grateful for the generous remark and kind sentiment toward my country and myself mr. prime minister we in the united states have an impression that this country be make up of descendant of the english and the french but i be glad to hear some applause come from the very back bench when you mention ireland i be sure they be make progress forward je i sen vraiment entre amis

 it be a deeply feel honor to address this distinguished legislative body and yet may i say that i feel very much at home with you here today for one third of my life be spend in the parliament of my own country the united states congress

 there be some difference between this body and my own the most noticeable to i be the lofty appearance of statesmanship which be on the face of the members of the senators who realize that they will never have to place their cause before the people again

 i feel at home also here because i number in my own state of massachusetts many friend and former constituent who be of canadian descent among the voter of massachusetts who be bear outside the united states the large group by far be bear in canada their vote be enough to determine the outcome of an election even a presidential election you can understand that having be elect president of the united states by less than 140 thousand vote out of 60 million that i be very conscious of these statistic

 the warmth of your hospitality symbolize more than merely the courtesy which may be accord to an individual visitor they symbolize the endure quality of amity and honor which have characterize our country relation for so many decade

 nearly forty year ago a distinguished prime minister of this country take the part of the united states at a disarmament conference he say they may not be angel but they be at least our friend

 i must say that i do not think that we probably demonstrate in that forty year that we be angel yet but i hope we have demonstrate that we be at least friend and i must say that i think in these day where hazard be our constant companion that friend be a very good thing to have

 the prime minister be the first of the leader from other land who be invite to call upon i shortly after i enter the white house and this be my first trip the first trip of my wife and myself outside of our country 's border it be just and fitting and appropriate and traditional that i should come here to canada across a border that know neither gun nor guerrilla

 but we share more than a common border we share a common heritage trace back to those early settler who travel from the beachhead of the maritime provinces and new england to the far reach of the pacific coast henry thoreau speak a common sentiment for they all eastward i go only by force westward i go free i must walk towards oregon and not towards europe we share common value from the past a common defense line at present and common aspiration for the future our future and indeed the future of all mankind

 geography have make we neighbor history have make we friend economics have make we partner and necessity have make we ally those whom nature hath so joined together let no man put asunder

 what unite we be far great than what divide we the issue and irritant that inevitably affect all neighbor be small deed in comparison with the issue that we face together above all the somber threat now pose to the whole neighborhood of this continent in fact to the whole community of nation but our alliance be bear not of fear but of hope it be an alliance that advance what we be for as well as oppose what we be against

 and so it be that when we speak of our common attitude and relationship canada and the united states speak in 1961 in term of unity we do not seek the unanimity that come to those who water down all issue to the low common denominator or to those who conceal their difference behind fix smile or to those who measure unity by standard of popularity and affection instead of trust and respect

 we be ally this be a partnership not an empire we be bind to have difference and disappointment and we be equally bind to bring they out into the open to settle they where they can be settle and to respect each other 's view when they can not be settle

 thus ours be the unity of equal and independent nation co tenant of the same continent heir of the same legacy and fully sovereign associate in the same historic endeavor to preserve freedom for ourselves and all who wish it to that endeavor we must bring great material and human resource the result of separate culture and independent economy and above all that endeavor require a free and full exchange of new and different idea on all issue and all undertaking

 for it be clear that no free nation can stand alone to meet the threat of those who make themselves our adversary that no free nation can retain any illusion about the nature of the threat and that no free nation can remain indifferent to the steady erosion of freedom around the globe

 it be equally clear that no western nation on its own can help those less develop land to fulfill their hope for steady progress

 and finally it be clear that in an age where new force be assert their strength around the globe when the political shape of the hemisphere be change rapidly nothing be more vital than the unity of the united states and of canada

 and so my friend of canada whatever problem may exist or arise between we i can assure you that my associate and i will be ever ready to discuss they with you and to take whatever step we can to remove they and whatever those problem may be i can also assure you that they shrink in comparison with the great and awesome task that await we as free and peace love nation

 so let we fix our attention not on those matter that vex we as neighbor but on the issue that face we as leader let we look southward as part of the hemisphere with whose fate we be both inextricably bind let we look eastward as part of the north atlantic community upon whose strength and will so many depend let we look westward to japan to the newly emerge land of asia and africa and the middle east where lie the people upon whose fate and choice the struggle for freedom may ultimately depend and let we look at the world in which we live and hope to go on living and at the way of life for which canadians and i be remind again of this this morning on my visit to your war memorial and americans alike have always be willing to give up their life in nearly every generation if necessary to defend and preserve freedom

 first if you will consider our mutual hope for this hemisphere stretch virtually from pole to pole the nation of the western hemisphere be bind together by the law of economic as well as geography by a common dedication to freedom as well as a common history of fight for it to make this entire area more secure against aggression of all kind to defend it against the encroachment of international communism in this hemisphere and to see our sister state fulfill their hope and need for economic and social reform and development be surely all challenge confront your nation and deserve of your talent and resource as well as ours

 to be sure it would mean an add responsibility but yours be not a nation that shrink from responsibility the hemisphere be a family into which we be bear and we can not turn our back on it in time of trouble nor can we stand aside from its great adventure of development i believe that all of the free member of the organization of american states would be hearten and strengthen by any increase in your hemispheric role your skill your resource your judicious perception at the council table even when it differ from our own view be all need throughout the inter american community your country and mine be partner in north american affair can we not now become partner in inter american affair

 secondly let we consider our mutual hope for the north atlantic community

 our nato alliance be still as it be when it be found the world 's great bulwark of freedom but the military balance of power have be change enemy tactic and weaponry have be change we can stand still only at our peril

 nato force structure be originally devise to meet the threat of a massive conventional attack in a period of western nuclear monopoly

 now if we be to meet the defense requirement of the 1960 's the nato country must push forward simultaneously along two line

 first we must strengthen the conventional capability of our alliance as a matter of the high priority

 to this end we in the united states be take step to increase the strength and mobility of our force and to modernize their equipment to the same end we will maintain our force now on the european continent and will increase their conventional capability we look to our nato allies to assign an equally high priority to this same essential task

 second we must make certain that nuclear weapon will continue to be available for the defense of the entire treaty area and that these weapon be at all time under close and flexible political control that meet the need of all the nato country we be prepared to join our allies in work out suitable arrangement for this purpose to make clear our own intention and commitment to the defense of western europe the united states will commit to the nato command five and subsequently still more polaris atomic missile submarine which be defensive weapon subject to any agree nato guideline on their control and use and responsive to the need of all member but still credible in an emergency beyond this we look to the possibility of eventually establish a nato sea bear force which would be truly multi lateral in ownership and control if this should be desire and find feasible by our allies once nato 's non nuclear goal have be achieve

 both of these measure improve conventional force and increase nuclear force be put forward in recognition of the fact that the defense of europe and the assurance that can be give to the people of europe and the defense of north america be indivisible in the hope that no aggressor will mistake our desire for peace with our determination to respond instantly to any attack with whatever force be appropriate and in the conviction that the time have come for all member of the nato community to far increase and integrate their respective force in the nato command area coordinate and share in research development production storage defense command and training at all level of armament so let we begin our opponent be watch to see if we in the west be divide they take courage when we be we must not let they be deceive or in doubt about our willingness to maintain our own freedom

 third let we turn to the less develop nation in the southern half of the globe those who struggle to escape the bond of mass misery which appeal to our heart as well as to our hope both your nation and mine have recognize our responsibility to these new nation our people have give generously if not always effectively we could not do less and now we must do more

 for our historic task in this embattle age be not merely to defend freedom it be to extend its writ and strengthen its covenant to people of different culture and creed and color whose policy or economic system may differ from our but whose desire to be free be no less fervent than our own through the organization for economic cooperation and development and the development assistance group we can pool our vast resource and skill and make available the kind of long term capital planning and know how without which these nation will never achieve independent and viable economy and without which our effort will be tragically waste i propose far that the oecd establish a development center where citizen and official and student and professional man of the atlantic area and the less develop world can meet to study in common the problem of economic development

 if we in the atlantic community can more closely coordinate our own economic policy and certainly the oecd provide the framework if we but use it and i hope that you will join as we be seek to join to use it then surely our potential economic resource be adequate to meet our responsibility consider for example the unsurpassed productivity of our farm less than 8 percent of the american working force be on our farm less than 11 percent of the canadian working force be on your few man on few acre than any nation on earth but free man on free acre can produce here in north america all the food that a hungry world could use while all the collective farm and force labor of the communist system produce one shortage after another this be a day to day miracle of our free society easy to forget at a time when our mind be catch up in the glamour of begin the exploration of space

 as the new nation emerge into independence they face a choice shall they develop by the method of consent or by turn their freedom over to the system of totalitarian control in make that decision they should look long and hard at the tragedy now be play out in the village of communist china

 if we can work closely together to make our food surplus a blessing instead of a curse no man woman or child need go hungry and if each of the more fortunate nation can bear its fair share of the effort to help the less fortunate not merely those with whom we have traditional tie but all who be willing and able to achieve meaningful growth and dignity then this decade will surely be a turning point in the history of the human family

 finally let i say just a few word about the world in which we live we should not misjudge the force of the challenge that we face a force that be powerful as well as insidious that inspire dedication as well as fear that use mean we can not adopt to achieve end we can not permit

 nor can we mistake the nature of the struggle it be not for concession or territory it be not simply between different system it be an age old battle for the survival of liberty itself and our great advantage and we must never forget it be that the irresistible tide that begin five hundred year before the birth of christ in ancient greece be for freedom and against tyranny and that be the wave of the future and the iron hand of totalitarianism can ultimately neither seize it nor turn it back in the word of macaulay a single breaker may recede but the tide be come in

 so we in the free world be not without hope we be not without friend and we be not without resource to defend ourselves and those who be associate with we believe in the peaceful settlement of dispute in the defense of human right we be work throughout the united nations and through regional and other association to lessen the risk the tension and the mean and opportunity for aggression that have be mount so rapidly throughout the world in these council of peace in the un emergency force in the middle east in the congo in the international control commission in south east asia in the ten nations commission on disarmament canada have play a leading important and constructive role

 if we can contain the powerful struggle of ideology and reduce it to manageable proportion we can proceed with the transcendent task of discipline the nuclear weapon which shadow our life and of find a widened range of common enterprise between ourselves and those who live under communist rule for in the end we live on one planet and we be part of one human family and whatever the struggle that confront we we must lose no chance to move forward towards a world of law and a world of disarmament

 at the conference table and in the mind of man the free world 's cause be strengthen because it be just but it be strengthen even more by the dedicated effort of free man and free nation as the great parliamentarian edmund burke say the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil be for good man to do nothing and that in essence be why i be here today this trip be more than a consultation more than a good will visit it be an act of faith faith in your country in your leader faith in the capacity of two great neighbor to meet their common problem and faith in the cause of freedom in which we be so intimately associate

mr. speaker mr. vice president my copartner in government gentleman and lady

 the constitution impose upon i the obligation to from time to time give to the congress information of the state of the union while this have traditionally be interpret as an annual affair this tradition have be break in extraordinary time

 these be extraordinary time and we face an extraordinary challenge our strength as well as our conviction have impose upon this nation the role of leader in freedom 's cause

 no role in history could be more difficult or more important we stand for freedom that be our conviction for ourselves that be our only commitment to other no friend no neutral and no adversary should think otherwise we be not against any man or any nation or any system except as it be hostile to freedom nor be i here to present a new military doctrine bear any one name or aim at any one area i be here to promote the freedom doctrine

 the great battleground for the defense and expansion of freedom today be the whole southern half of the globe asia latin america africa and the middle east the land of the rise people their revolution be the great in human history they seek an end to injustice tyranny and exploitation more than an end they seek a beginning

 and theirs be a revolution which we would support regardless of the cold war and regardless of which political or economic route they should choose to freedom

 for the adversary of freedom do not create the revolution nor do they create the condition which compel it but they be seek to ride the crest of its wave to capture it for themselves

 yet their aggression be more often conceal than open they have fire no missile and their troop be seldom see they send arm agitator aid technician and propaganda to every troubled area but where fighting be require it be usually do by other by guerrilla strike at night by assassin strike alone assassin who have take the life of four thousand civil officer in the last twelve month in vietnam alone by subversive and saboteur and insurrectionist who in some case control whole area inside of independent nations.1

 1 at this point the follow paragraph which appear in fine text as sign and transmit to the senate and house of representatives be omit in the reading of the message

 they possess a powerful intercontinental strike force large force for conventional war a well train underground in nearly every country the power to conscript talent and manpower for any purpose the capacity for quick decision a closed society without dissent or free information and long experience in the technique of violence and subversion they make the most of their scientific success their economic progress and their pose as a foe of colonialism and friend of popular revolution they prey on unstable or unpopular government unseal or unknown boundary unfilled hope convulsive change massive poverty illiteracy unrest and frustration

 with these formidable weapon the adversary of freedom plan to consolidate their territory to exploit to control and finally to destroy the hope of the world 's new nation and they have ambition to do it before the end of this decade it be a contest of will and purpose as well as force and violence a battle for mind and soul as well as life and territory and in that contest we can not stand aside

 we stand as we have always stand from our early beginning for the independence and equality of all nation this nation be bear of revolution and raise in freedom and we do not intend to leave an open road for despotism

 there be no single simple policy which meet this challenge experience have teach we that no one nation have the power or the wisdom to solve all the problem of the world or manage its revolutionary tide that extend our commitment do not always increase our security that any initiative carry with it the risk of a temporary defeat that nuclear weapon can not prevent subversion that no free people can be keep free without will and energy of their own and that no two nation or situation be exactly alike

 yet there be much we can do and must do the proposal i bring before you be numerous and varied they arise from the host of special opportunity and danger which have become increasingly clear in recent month take together i believe that they can mark another step forward in our effort as a people i be here to ask the help of this congress and the nation in approve these necessary measure

 ii economic and social progress at home

 the first and basic task confront this nation this year be to turn recession into recovery an affirmative anti recession program initiate with your cooperation support the natural force in the private sector and our economy be now enjoy renew confidence and energy the recession have be halt recovery be under way

 but the task of abate unemployment and achieve a full use of our resource do remain a serious challenge for we all large scale unemployment during a recession be bad enough but large scale unemployment during a period of prosperity would be intolerable

 i be therefore transmit to the congress a new manpower development and training program to train or retrain several hundred thousand worker particularly in those area where we have see chronic unemployment as a result of technological factor in new occupational skill over a four year period in order to replace those skill make obsolete by automation and industrial change with the new skill which the new process demand

 it should be a satisfaction to we all that we have make great stride in restore world confidence in the dollar halt the outflow of gold and improve our balance of payment during the last two month our gold stock actually increase by seventeen million dollar compare to a loss of 635 million dollar during the last two month of 1960 we must maintain this progress and this will require the cooperation and restraint of everyone as recovery progress there will be temptation to seek unjustified price and wage increase these we can not afford they will only handicap our effort to compete abroad and to achieve full recovery here at home labor and management must and i be confident that they will pursue responsible wage and price policy in these critical time i look to the president 's advisory committee on labor management policy to give a strong lead in this direction

 moreover if the budget deficit now increase by the need of our security be to be hold within manageable proportion it will be necessary to hold tightly to prudent fiscal standard and i request the cooperation of the congress in this regard to refrain from add fund or program desirable as they may be to the budget to end the postal deficit as my predecessor also recommend through increase rate a deficit incidentally this year which exceed the fiscal 1962 cost of all the space and defense measure that i be submit today to provide full pay as you go highway financing and to close those tax loophole early specify our security and progress can not be cheaply purchase and their price must be find in what we all forego as well as what we all must pay

 iii economic and social progress abroad

 i stress the strength of our economy because it be essential to the strength of our nation and what be true in our case be true in the case of other country their strength in the struggle for freedom depend on the strength of their economic and their social progress

 we would be badly mistake to consider their problem in military term alone for no amount of arm and army can help stabilize those government which be unable or unwilling to achieve social and economic reform and development military pact can not help nation whose social injustice and economic chaos invite insurgency and penetration and subversion the most skillful counter guerrilla effort can not succeed where the local population be too catch up in its own misery to be concern about the advance of communism

 but for those who share this view we stand ready now as we have in the past to provide generously of our skill and our capital and our food to assist the people of the less develop nation to reach their goal in freedom to help they before they be engulf in crisis

 this be also our great opportunity in 1961 if we grasp it then subversion to prevent its success be expose as an unjustifiable attempt to keep these nation from either be free or equal but if we do not pursue it and if they do not pursue it the bankruptcy of unstable government one by one and of unfilled hope will surely lead to a series of totalitarian receivership

 early in the year i outline to the congress a new program for aid emerge nation and it be my intention to transmit shortly draft legislation to implement this program to establish a new act for international development and to add to the figure previously request in view of the swift pace of critical event an additional 250 million dollar for a presidential contingency fund to be use only upon a presidential determination in each case with regular and complete report to the congress in each case when there be a sudden and extraordinary drain upon our regular fund which we can not foresee as illustrate by recent event in southeast asia and it make necessary the use of this emergency reserve the total amount request now raise to 2.65 billion dollar be both minimal and crucial i do not see how anyone who be concern as we all be about the grow threat to freedom around the globe and who be ask what more we can do as a people can weaken or oppose the single most important program available for build the frontier of freedom

 iv

 all that i have say make it clear that we be engage in a world wide struggle in which we bear a heavy burden to preserve and promote the ideal that we share with all mankind or have alien ideal force upon they that struggle have highlight the role of our information agency it be essential that the fund previously request for this effort be not only approve in full but increase by 2 million 400 thousand dollar to a total of 121 million dollar

 this new request be for additional radio and television to latin america and southeast asia these tool be particularly effective and essential in the city and village of those great continent as a means of reach million of uncertain people to tell they of our interest in their fight for freedom in latin america we be propose to increase our spanish and portuguese broadcast to a total of 154 hour a week compare to 42 hour today none of which be in portuguese the language of about one third of the people of south america the soviets red chinese and satellite already broadcast into latin america more than 134 hour a week in spanish and portuguese communist china alone do more public information broadcasting in our own hemisphere than we do moreover powerful propaganda broadcast from havana now be hear throughout latin america encourage new revolution in several country

 similarly in laos vietnam cambodia and thailand we must communicate our determination and support to those upon whom our hope for resist the communist tide in that continent ultimately depend our interest be in the truth

 v. our partnership for self defense

 but while we talk of sharing and building and the competition of idea other talk of arm and threaten war so we have learn to keep our defense strong and to cooperate with other in a partnership of self defense the event of recent week have cause we to look anew at these effort

 the center of freedom 's defense be our network of world alliance extend from nato recommend by a democratic president and approve by a republican congress to seato recommend by a republican president and approve by a democratic congress these alliance be construct in the 1940 's and 1950' it be our task and responsibility in the 1960 's to strengthen they

 to meet the change condition of power and power relationship have change we have endorse an increase emphasis on nato 's conventional strength at the same time we be affirm our conviction that the nato nuclear deterrent must also be keep strong i have make clear our intention to commit to the nato command for this purpose the 5 polaris submarine originally suggest by president eisenhower with the possibility if need of more to come

 second a major part of our partnership for self defense be the military assistance program the main burden of local defense against local attack subversion insurrection or guerrilla warfare must of necessity rest with local force where these force have the necessary will and capacity to cope with such threat our intervention be rarely necessary or helpful where the will be present and only capacity be lacking our military assistance program can be of help

 but this program like economic assistance need a new emphasis it can not be extend without regard to the social political and military reform essential to internal respect and stability the equipment and training provide must be tailor to legitimate local need and to our own foreign and military policy not to our supply of military stock or a local leader 's desire for military display and military assistance can in addition to its military purpose make a contribution to economic progress as do our own army engineers

 in an early message i request 1.6 billion dollar for military assistance state that this would maintain exist force level but that i could not foresee how much more might be require it be now clear that this be not enough the present crisis in southeast asia on which the vice president have make a valuable report the rise threat of communism in latin america the increase arm traffic in africa and all the new pressure on every nation find on the map by trace your finger along the border of the communist bloc in asia and the middle east all make clear the dimension of our need

 i therefore request the congress to provide a total of 1.885 billion dollar for military assistance in the come fiscal year an amount less than that request a year ago but a minimum which must be assure if we be to help those nation make secure their independence this must be prudently and wisely spend and that will be our common endeavor military and economic assistance have be a heavy burden on our citizen for a long time and i recognize the strong pressure against it but this battle be far from over it be reach a crucial stage and i believe we should participate in it we can not merely state our opposition to totalitarian advance without pay the price of help those now under the great pressure

 vi our own military and intelligence

 in line with these development i have direct a further reinforcement of our own capacity to deter or resist non nuclear aggression in the conventional field with one exception i find no present need for large new levy of man what be need be rather a change of position to give we still far increase in flexibility

 therefore i be direct the secretary of defense to undertake a reorganization and modernization of the army 's divisional structure to increase its non nuclear firepower to improve its tactical mobility in any environment to insure its flexibility to meet any direct or indirect threat to facilitate its coordination with our major ally and to provide more modern mechanized division in europe and bring their equipment up to date and new airborne brigade in both the pacific and europe

 and secondly i be ask the congress for an additional 100 million dollar to begin the procurement task necessary to re equip this new army structure with the most modern material new helicopter new armored personnel carrier and new howitzer for example must be obtain now

 third i be direct the secretary of defense to expand rapidly and substantially in cooperation with our allies the orientation of exist force for the conduct of nonnuclear war para military operation and sub limited or unconventional war

 in addition our special force and unconventional warfare unit will be increase and reorient throughout the service new emphasis must be place on the special skill and language which be require to work with local population

 fourth the army be develop plan to make possible a much more rapid deployment of a major portion of its highly train reserve force when these plan be complete and the reserve be strengthen two combat equip division plus their support force a total of 89,000 man could be ready in an emergency for operation with but 3 week notice—2 more division with but 5 week notice and six additional division and their support force make a total of 10 division could be deployable with less than 8 week notice in short these new plan will allow we to almost double the combat power of the army in less than two month compare to the nearly nine month heretofore require

 fifth to enhance the already formidable ability of the marine corps to respond to limited war emergency i be ask the congress for 60 million dollar to increase the marine corps strength to 190,000 man this will increase the initial impact and staying power of our three marine division and three air wing and provide a train nucleus for further expansion if necessary for self defense

 finally to cite one other area of activity that be both legitimate and necessary as a means of self defense in an age of hide peril our whole intelligence effort must be review and its coordination with other element of policy assure the congress and the american people be entitle to know that we will institute whatever new organization policy and control be necessary

 vii civil defense

 one major element of the national security program which this nation have never squarely face up to be civil defense this problem arise not from present trend but from national inaction in which most of we have participate in the past decade we have intermittently consider a variety of program but we have never adopt a consistent policy public consideration have be largely characterize by apathy indifference and skepticism while at the same time many of the civil defense plan have be so far reach and unrealistic that they have not gain essential support

 this administration have be look hard at exactly what civil defense can and can not do it can not be obtain cheaply it can not give an assurance of blast protection that will be proof against surprise attack or guarantee against obsolescence or destruction and it can not deter a nuclear attack

 we will deter an enemy from make a nuclear attack only if our retaliatory power be so strong and so invulnerable that he know he would be destroy by our response if we have that strength civil defense be not need to deter an attack if we should ever lack it civil defense would not be an adequate substitute

 but this deterrent concept assume rational calculation by rational man and the history of this planet and particularly the history of the 20th century be sufficient to remind we of the possibility of an irrational attack a miscalculation an accidental war for a war of escalation in which the stake by each side gradually increase to the point of maximum danger which can not be either foresee or deter it be on this basis that civil defense can be readily justifiable as insurance for the civilian population in case of an enemy miscalculation it be insurance we trust will never be need but insurance which we could never forgive ourselves for forego in the event of catastrophe

 once the validity of this concept be recognize there be no point in delay the initiation of a nation wide long range program of identify present fallout shelter capacity and provide shelter in new and exist structure such a program would protect million of people against the hazard of radioactive fallout in the event of large scale nuclear attack effective performance of the entire program not only require new legislative authority and more fund but also sound organizational arrangement

 therefore under the authority vest in i by reorganization plan no 1 of 1958 i be assign responsibility for this program to the top civilian authority already responsible for continental defense the secretary of defense it be important that this function remain civilian in nature and leadership and this feature will not be change

 the office of civil and defense mobilization will be reconstitute as a small staff agency to assist in the coordination of these function to more accurately describe its role its title should be change to the office of emergency planning

 as soon as those newly charge with these responsibility have prepare new authorization and appropriation request such request will be transmit to the congress for a much strengthen federal state civil defense program such a program will provide federal fund for identify fallout shelter capacity in exist structure and it will include where appropriate incorporation of shelter in federal building new requirement for shelter in building construct with federal assistance and matching grant and other incentive for construct shelter in state and local and private building

 federal appropriation for civil defense in fiscal 1962 under this program will in all likelihood be more than triple the pende budget request and they will increase sharply in subsequent year financial participation will also be require from state and local government and from private citizen but no insurance be cost free and every american citizen and his community must decide for themselves whether this form of survival insurance justify the expenditure of effort time and money for myself i be convinced that it do

 viii disarmament

 i can not end this discussion of defense and armament without emphasize our strong hope the creation of an orderly world where disarmament will be possible our aim do not prepare for war they be effort to discourage and resist the adventure of other that could end in war

 that be why it be consistent with these effort that we continue to press for properly safeguard disarmament measure at geneva in cooperation with the united kingdom we have put forward concrete proposal to make clear our wish to meet the soviets half way in an effective nuclear test ban treaty the first significant but essential step on the road towards disarmament up to now their response have not be what we hope but mr. dean return last night to geneva and we intend to go the last mile in patience to secure this gain if we can

 meanwhile we be determined to keep disarmament high on our agenda to make an intensified effort to develop acceptable political and technical alternative to the present arm race to this end i shall send to the congress a measure to establish a strengthened and enlarge disarmament agency

 ix space

 finally if we be to win the battle that be now go on around the world between freedom and tyranny the dramatic achievement in space which occur in recent week should have make clear to we all as do the sputnik in 1957 the impact of this adventure on the mind of man everywhere who be attempt to make a determination of which road they should take since early in my term our effort in space have be under review with the advice of the vice president who be chairman of the national space council we have examine where we be strong and where we be not where we may succeed and where we may not now it be time to take long stride time for a great new american enterprise time for this nation to take a clearly lead role in space achievement which in many way may hold the key to our future on earth

 i believe we possess all the resource and talent necessary but the fact of the matter be that we have never make the national decision or marshal the national resource require for such leadership we have never specify long range goal on an urgent time schedule or manage our resource and our time so as to insure their fulfillment

 recognize the head start obtain by the soviets with their large rocket engine which give they many month of lead time and recognize the likelihood that they will exploit this lead for some time to come in still more impressive success we nevertheless be require to make new effort on our own for while we can not guarantee that we shall one day be first we can guarantee that any failure to make this effort will make we last we take an additional risk by make it in full view of the world but as show by the feat of astronaut shepard this very risk enhance our stature when we be successful but this be not merely a race space be open to we now and our eagerness to share its meaning be not govern by the effort of other we go into space because whatever mankind must undertake free man must fully share

 i therefore ask the congress above and beyond the increase i have early request for space activity to provide the fund which be need to meet the follow national goal

 first i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieve the goal before this decade be out of land a man on the moon and return he safely to the earth no single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind or more important for the long range exploration of space and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish we propose to accelerate the development of the appropriate lunar space craft we propose to develop alternate liquid and solid fuel booster much large than any now be develop until certain which be superior we propose additional fund for other engine development and for unmanned exploration exploration which be particularly important for one purpose which this nation will never overlook the survival of the man who first make this daring flight but in a very real sense it will not be one man go to the moon if we make this judgment affirmatively it will be an entire nation for all of we must work to put he there

 secondly an additional 23 million dollar together with 7 million dollar already available will accelerate development of the rover nuclear rocket this give promise of some day provide a means for even more exciting and ambitious exploration of space perhaps beyond the moon perhaps to the very end of the solar system itself

 third an additional 50 million dollar will make the most of our present leadership by accelerate the use of space satellite for world wide communication

 fourth an additional 75 million dollar of which 53 million dollar be for the weather bureau will help give we at the early possible time a satellite system for world wide weather observation

 let it be clear and this be a judgment which the members of the congress must finally make let it be clear that i be ask the congress and the country to accept a firm commitment to a new course of action a course which will last for many year and carry very heavy cost 531 million dollar in fiscal 62 an estimate seven to nine billion dollar additional over the next five year if we be to go only half way or reduce our sight in the face of difficulty in my judgment it would be well not to go at all

 now this be a choice which this country must make and i be confident that under the leadership of the space committees of the congress and the appropriating committees that you will consider the matter carefully

 it be a most important decision that we make as a nation but all of you have live through the last four year and have see the significance of space and the adventure in space and no one can predict with certainty what the ultimate meaning will be of mastery of space

 i believe we should go to the moon but i think every citizen of this country as well as the members of the congress should consider the matter carefully in make their judgment to which we have give attention over many week and month because it be a heavy burden and there be no sense in agree or desire that the united states take an affirmative position in outer space unless we be prepared to do the work and bear the burden to make it successful if we be not we should decide today and this year

 this decision demand a major national commitment of scientific and technical manpower materiel and facility and the possibility of their diversion from other important activity where they be already thinly spread it mean a degree of dedication organization and discipline which have not always characterize our research and development effort it mean we can not afford undue work stoppage inflate cost of material or talent wasteful interagency rivalry or a high turnover of key personnel

 new objective and new money can not solve these problem they could in fact aggravate they far unless every scientist every engineer every serviceman every technician contractor and civil servant give his personal pledge that this nation will move forward with the full speed of freedom in the exciting adventure of space

 x. conclusion

 in conclusion let i emphasize one point it be not a pleasure for any president of the united states as i be sure it be not a pleasure for my predecessor to come before the congress and ask for new appropriation which place burden on our people i come to this conclusion with some reluctance but in my judgment this be a most serious time in the life of our country and in the life of freedom around the globe and it be the obligation i believe of the president of the united states to at least make his recommendation to the members of the congress so that they can reach their own conclusion with that judgment before they you must decide yourself as i have decide and i be confident that whether you finally decide in the way that i have decide or not that your judgment as my judgment be reach on what be in the good interest of our country

 in conclusion let i emphasize one point that we be determine as a nation in 1961 that freedom shall survive and succeed and whatever the peril and set back we have some very large advantage

 the first be the simple fact that we be on the side of liberty and since the beginning of history and particularly since the end of the second world war liberty have be win out all over the globe

 a second great asset be that we be not alone we have friend and ally all over the world who share our devotion to freedom may i cite as a symbol of traditional and effective friendship the great ally i be about to visit france i look forward to my visit to france and to my discussion with a great captain of the western world president de gaulle as a meeting of particular significance permit the kind of close and range consultation that will strengthen both our country and serve the common purpose of world wide peace and liberty such serious conversation do not require a pale unanimity they be rather the instrument of trust and understanding over a long road

 a third asset be our desire for peace it be sincere and i believe the world know it we be prove it in our patience at the test ban table and we be prove it in the un where our effort have be direct to maintain that organization 's usefulness as a protector of the independence of small nation in these and other instance the response of our opponent have not be encouraging

 yet it be important to know that our patience at the bargaining table be nearly inexhaustible though our credulity be limited that our hope for peace be unfailing while our determination to protect our security be resolute for these reason i have long think it wise to meet with the soviet premier for a personal exchange of view a meeting in vienna turn out to be convenient for we both and the austrian government have kindly make we welcome no formal agenda be plan and no negotiation will be undertake but we will make dear america 's endure concern be for both peace and freedom that we be anxious to live in harmony with the russian people that we seek no conquest no satellite no rich that we seek only the day when nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war any more

 finally our great asset in this struggle be the american people their willingness to pay the price for these program to understand and accept a long struggle to share their resource with other less fortunate people to meet the tax level and close the tax loophole i have request to exercise self restraint instead of push up wage or price or over produce certain crop or spread military secret or urge unessential expenditure or improper monopoly or harmful work stoppage to serve in the peace corps or the armed services or the federal civil service or the congress to strive for excellence in their school in their city and in their physical fitness and that of their child to take part in civil defense to pay high postal rate and high payroll taxis and high teacher salary in order to strengthen our society to show friendship to student and visitor from other land who visit we and go back in many case to be the future leader with an image of america and i want that image and i know you do to be affirmative and positive and finally to practice democracy at home in all states with all race to respect each other and to protect the constitutional right of all citizen

 i have not ask for a single program which do not cause one or all americans some inconvenience or some hardship or some sacrifice but they have respond and you in the congress have respond to your duty and i feel confident in ask today for a similar response to these new and large demand it be hearten to know as i journey abroad that our country be unite in its commitment to freedom and be ready to do its duty

good evening my fellow citizen

 i return this morning from a week long trip to europe and i want to report to you on that trip in full it be in every sense an unforgettable experience the people of paris of vienna of london be generous in their greeting they be heartwarme in their hospitality and their graciousness to my wife be particularly appreciate

 we know of course that the crowd and the shout be mean in large measure for the country that we represent which be regard as the chief defender of freedom equally memorable be the pageantry of european history and their culture that be very much a part of any ceremonial reception to lay a wreath at the arc de triomphe to dine at versailles and schonbrunn palace and with the queen of england these be the colorful memory that will remain with we for many year to come each of the three city that we visit paris vienna and london have exist for many century and each serve as a reminder that the western civilization that we seek to preserve have flower over many year and have defend itself over many century but this be not a ceremonial trip two aim of american foreign policy above all other be the reason for the trip the unity of the free world whose strength be the security of we all and the eventual achievement of a last peace my trip be devoted to the advancement of these two aim

 to strengthen the unity of the west our journey open in paris and close in london my talk with general de gaulle be profoundly encouraging to i certain difference in our attitude on one or another problem become insignificant in view of our common commitment to defend freedom our alliance i believe become more secure the friendship of our nation i hope with theirs become firm and the relation between the two of we who bear responsibility become close and i hope be mark by confidence i find general de gaulle far more interested in our frankly state our position whether or not it be his own than in appear to agree with he when we do not but he know full well the true meaning of an alliance he be after all the only major leader of world war ii who still occupy a position of great responsibility his life have be one of unusual dedication he be a man of extraordinary personal character symbolize the new strength and the historic grandeur of france throughout our discussion he take the long view of france and the world at large i find he a wise counselor for the future and an informative guide to the history that he have help to make thus we have a valuable meeting

 i believe that certain doubt and suspicion that might have come up in a long time i believe be remove on both side problem which prove to be not of substance but of wording or procedure be clear away no question however sensitive be avoid no area of interest be ignore and the conclusion that we reach will be important for the future in our agreement on defend berlin on work to improve the defense of europe on aid the economic and political independence of the underdeveloped world include latin america on spur european economic unity on conclude successfully the conference on laos and on close consultation and solidarity in the western alliance

 general de gaulle could not have be more cordial and i could not have more confidence in any man in addition to his individual strength of character the french people as a whole show vitality and energy which be both impressive and gratifying their recovery from the postwar period be dramatic their productivity be increase and they be steadily build their stature in both europe and africa and thus i leave paris for vienna with increase confidence in western unity and strength
 the people of vienna know what it be to live under occupation and they know what it be to live in freedom their welcome to i as president of this country should be heartwarme to we all i go to vienna to meet the leader of the soviet union mr. khrushchev for 2 day we meet in sober intensive conversation and i believe it be my obligation to the people to the congress and to our ally to report on those conversation candidly and publicly

 mr. khrushchev and i have a very full and frank exchange of view on the major issue that now divide our two country i will tell you now that it be a very sober 2 day there be no discourtesy no loss of temper no threat or ultimatum by either side no advantage or concession be either gain or give no major decision be either plan or take no spectacular progress be either achieve or pretend

 this kind of informal exchange may not be as exciting as a full fledged summit meeting with a fix agenda and a large corps of adviser where negotiation be attempt and new agreement seek but this be not intend to be and be not such a meeting nor do we plan any future summit meeting at vienna

 but i find this meeting with chairman khrushchev as somber as it be to be immensely useful i have read his speech and of his policy i have be advise on his view i have be tell by other leader of the west general de gaulle chancellor adenauer prime minister macmillan what manner of man he be

 but i bear the responsibility of the presidency of the united states and it be my duty to make decision that no adviser and no ally can make for i it be my obligation and responsibility to see that these decision be as informed as possible that they be base on as much direct firsthand knowledge as possible

 i therefore think it be of immense importance that i know mr. khrushchev that i gain as much insight and understanding as i could on his present and future policy at the same time i want to make certain mr. khrushchev know this country and its policy that he understand our strength and our determination and that he know that we desire peace with all nation of every kind

 i want to present our view to he directly precisely realistically and with an opportunity for discussion and clarification this be do no new aim be state in private that have not be state in public on either side the gap between we be not in such a short period materially reduce but at least the channel of communication be open more fully at least the chance of a dangerous misjudgment on either side should now be less and at least the man on whose decision the peace in part depend have agree to remain in contact

 this be important for neither of we try to merely please the other to agree merely to be agreeable to say what the other want to hear and just as our judicial system rely on witness appear in court and on cross examination instead of hearsay testimony or affidavit on paper so too be this direct give and take of immeasurable value in make clear and precise what we consider to be vital for the fact of the matter be that the soviets and ourselves give wholly different meaning to the same word war peace democracy and popular will

 we have wholly different view of right and wrong of what be an internal affair and what be aggression and above all we have wholly different concept of where the world be and where it be go

 only by such a discussion be it possible for i to be sure that mr. khrushchev know how differently we view the present and the future our view contrast sharply but at least we know well at the end where we both stand neither of we be there to dictate a settlement or to convert the other to a cause or to concede our basic interest but both of we be there i think because we realize that each nation have the power to inflict enormous damage upon the other that such a war could and should be avoid if at all possible since it would settle no dispute and prove no doctrine and that care should thus be take to prevent our conflict interest from so directly confront each other that war necessarily ensue we believe in a system of national freedom and independence he believe in an expand and dynamic concept of world communism and the question be whether these two system can ever hope to live in peace without permit any loss of security or any denial of the freedom of our friend however difficult it may seem to answer this question in the affirmative as we approach so many harsh test i think we owe it to all mankind to make every possible effort that be why i consider the vienna talk to be useful the somber mood that they convey be not cause for elation or relaxation nor be it cause for undue pessimism or fear it simply demonstrate how much work we in the free world have to do and how long and hard a struggle must be our fate as americans in this generation as the chief defender of the cause of liberty the one area which afford some immediate prospect of accord be laos both side recognize the need to reduce the danger in that situation both side endorse the concept of a neutral and independent laos much in the manner of burma or cambodia

 of critical importance to the current conference on laos in geneva both side recognize the importance of an effective cease fire it be urgent that this be translate into new attitude at geneva enable the international control commission to do its duty to make certain that a cease fire be enforce and maintain i be hopeful that progress can be make on this matter in the come day at geneva for that would greatly improve international atmosphere

 no such hope emerge however with respect to the other deadlocke geneva conference seek a treaty to ban nuclear test mr. khrushchev make it clear that there could not be a neutral administrator in his opinion because no one be truly neutral that a soviet veto would have to apply to act of enforcement that inspection be only a subterfuge for espionage in the absence of total disarmament and that the present test ban negotiation appear futile in short our hope for an end to nuclear test for an end to the spread of nuclear weapon and for some slow down of the arm race have be strike a serious blow nevertheless the stake be too important for we to abandon the draft treaty we have offer at geneva

 but our most somber talk be on the subject of germany and berlin i make it clear to mr. khrushchev that the security of western europe and therefore our own security be deeply involved in our presence and our access right to west berlin that those right be base on law and not on sufferance and that we be determined to maintain those right at any risk and thus meet our obligation to the people of west berlin and their right to choose their own future

 mr. khrushchev in turn present his view in detail and his presentation will be the subject of further communication but we be not seek to change the present situation a bind german peace treaty be a matter for all who be at war with germany and we and our ally can not abandon our obligation to the people of west berlin

 generally mr. khrushchev do not talk in term of war he believe the world will move his way without resort to force he speak of his nation 's achievement in space he stress his intention to outdo we in industrial production to out trade we to prove to the world the superiority of his system over ours most of all he predict the triumph of communism in the new and less developed country

 he be certain that the tide there be move his way that the revolution of rise people would eventually be a communist revolution and that the so call war of liberation support by the kremlin would replace the old method of direct aggression and invasion

 in the 1940 's and early fifty the great danger be from communist army march across free border which we see in korea our nuclear monopoly help to prevent this in other area now we face a new and different threat we no long have a nuclear monopoly their missile they believe will hold off our missile and their troop can match our troop should we intervene in these so call war of liberation thus the local conflict they support can turn in their favor through guerrilla or insurgent or subversion a small group of disciplined communists could exploit discontent and misery in a country where the average income may be $ 60 or $ 70 a year and seize control therefore of an entire country without communist troop ever cross any international frontier this be the communist theory

 but i believe just as strongly that time will prove it wrong that liberty and independence and self determination not communism be the future of man and that free man have the will and the resource to win the struggle for freedom but it be clear that this struggle in this area of the new and poor nation will be a continue crisis of this decade

 mr. khrushchev make one point which i wish to pass on he say there be many disorder throughout the world and he should not be blame for they all he be quite right it be easy to dismiss as communist inspire every anti government or anti american riot every overthrow of a corrupt regime or every mass protest against misery and despair these be not all communist inspire the communists move in to exploit they to infiltrate their leadership to ride their crest to victory but the communists do not create the condition which cause they

 in short the hope for freedom in these area which see so much poverty and illiteracy so many child who be sick so many child who die in the first year so many family without home so many family without hope the future for freedom in these area rest with the local people and their government

 if they have the will to determine their own future if their government have the support of their own people if their honest and progressive measure help their people have inspire confidence and zeal then no guerrilla or insurgent action can succeed but where those condition do not exist a military guarantee against external attack from across a border offer little protection against internal decay

 yet all this do not mean that our nation and the west and the free world can only sit by on the contrary we have an historic opportunity to help these country build their society until they be so strong and broadly base that only an outside invasion could topple they and that threat we know can be stop

 we can train and equip their force to resist communist supply insurrection we can help develop the industrial and agricultural base on which new living standard can be build we can encourage well administration and well education and well tax and land distribution and a well life for the people

 all this and more we can do because we have the talent and the resource to do it if we will only use and share they i know that there be a great deal of feeling in the united states that we have carry the burden of economic assistance long enough but these country that we be now support stretch all the way along from the top of europe through the middle east down through saigon be now subject to great effort internally in many of they to seize control

 if we be not prepared to assist they in make a well life for their people then i believe that the prospect for freedom in those area be uncertain we must i believe assist they if we be determined to meet with commitment of assistance our word against the communist advance the burden be heavy we have carry it for many year but i believe that this fight be not over this battle go on and we have to play our part in it and therefore i hope again that we will assist these people so that they can remain free

 it be fitting that congress open its hearing on our new foreign military and economic aid program in washington at the very time that mr. khrushchev 's word in vienna be demonstrate as nothing else could the need for that very program it should be well run effectively administer but i believe we must do it and i hope that you the american people will support it again because i think it be vitally important to the security of these area there be no use talk against the communist advance unless we be willing to meet our responsibility however burdensome they may be

 i do not justify this aid merely on the ground of anti communism it be a recognition of our opportunity and obligation to help these people be free and we be not alone

 i find that the people of france for example be do far more in africa in the way of aid independent nation than our own country be but i know that foreign aid be a burden that be keenly feel and i can only say that we have no more crucial obligation now

 my stay in england be short but the visit give i a chance to confer privately again with prime minister macmillan just as other of our party in vienna be confer yesterday with general de gaulle and chancellor adenauer we all agree that there be work to be do in the west and from our conversation have come agree step to get on with that work our day in london cap by a meeting with queen elizabeth and prince philip be a strong reminder at the end of a long journey that the west remain united in its determination to hold to its standard

 may i conclude by say simply that i be glad to be home we have on this trip admire splendid place and see stir sight but we be glad to be home no demonstration of support abroad could mean so much as the support which you the american people have so generously give to our country with that support i be not fearful of the future we must be patient we must be determine we must be courageous we must accept both risk and burden but with the will and the work freedom will prevail
 good night and thank you very much

 good evening my fellow citizen

 i return this morning from a week long trip to europe and i want to report to you on that trip in full it be in every sense an unforgettable experience the people of paris of vienna of london be generous in their greeting they be heartwarme in their hospitality and their graciousness to my wife be particularly appreciate

 we know of course that the crowd and the shout be mean in large measure for the country that we represent which be regard as the chief defender of freedom equally memorable be the pageantry of european history and their culture that be very much a part of any ceremonial reception to lay a wreath at the arc de triomphe to dine at versailles and schonbrunn palace and with the queen of england these be the colorful memory that will remain with we for many year to come each of the three city that we visit paris vienna and london have exist for many century and each serve as a reminder that the western civilization that we seek to preserve have flower over many year and have defend itself over many century but this be not a ceremonial trip two aim of american foreign policy above all other be the reason for the trip the unity of the free world whose strength be the security of we all and the eventual achievement of a last peace my trip be devoted to the advancement of these two aim

 to strengthen the unity of the west our journey open in paris and close in london my talk with general de gaulle be profoundly encouraging to i certain difference in our attitude on one or another problem become insignificant in view of our common commitment to defend freedom our alliance i believe become more secure the friendship of our nation i hope with theirs become firm and the relation between the two of we who bear responsibility become close and i hope be mark by confidence i find general de gaulle far more interested in our frankly state our position whether or not it be his own than in appear to agree with he when we do not but he know full well the true meaning of an alliance he be after all the only major leader of world war ii who still occupy a position of great responsibility his life have be one of unusual dedication he be a man of extraordinary personal character symbolize the new strength and the historic grandeur of france throughout our discussion he take the long view of france and the world at large i find he a wise counselor for the future and an informative guide to the history that he have help to make thus we have a valuable meeting

 i believe that certain doubt and suspicion that might have come up in a long time i believe be remove on both side problem which prove to be not of substance but of wording or procedure be clear away no question however sensitive be avoid no area of interest be ignore and the conclusion that we reach will be important for the future in our agreement on defend berlin on work to improve the defense of europe on aid the economic and political independence of the underdeveloped world include latin america on spur european economic unity on conclude successfully the conference on laos and on close consultation and solidarity in the western alliance

 general de gaulle could not have be more cordial and i could not have more confidence in any man in addition to his individual strength of character the french people as a whole show vitality and energy which be both impressive and gratifying their recovery from the postwar period be dramatic their productivity be increase and they be steadily build their stature in both europe and africa and thus i leave paris for vienna with increase confidence in western unity and strength
 the people of vienna know what it be to live under occupation and they know what it be to live in freedom their welcome to i as president of this country should be heartwarme to we all i go to vienna to meet the leader of the soviet union mr. khrushchev for 2 day we meet in sober intensive conversation and i believe it be my obligation to the people to the congress and to our ally to report on those conversation candidly and publicly

 mr. khrushchev and i have a very full and frank exchange of view on the major issue that now divide our two country i will tell you now that it be a very sober 2 day there be no discourtesy no loss of temper no threat or ultimatum by either side no advantage or concession be either gain or give no major decision be either plan or take no spectacular progress be either achieve or pretend

 this kind of informal exchange may not be as exciting as a full fledged summit meeting with a fix agenda and a large corps of adviser where negotiation be attempt and new agreement seek but this be not intend to be and be not such a meeting nor do we plan any future summit meeting at vienna

 but i find this meeting with chairman khrushchev as somber as it be to be immensely useful i have read his speech and of his policy i have be advise on his view i have be tell by other leader of the west general de gaulle chancellor adenauer prime minister macmillan what manner of man he be

 but i bear the responsibility of the presidency of the united states and it be my duty to make decision that no adviser and no ally can make for i it be my obligation and responsibility to see that these decision be as informed as possible that they be base on as much direct firsthand knowledge as possible

 i therefore think it be of immense importance that i know mr. khrushchev that i gain as much insight and understanding as i could on his present and future policy at the same time i want to make certain mr. khrushchev know this country and its policy that he understand our strength and our determination and that he know that we desire peace with all nation of every kind

 i want to present our view to he directly precisely realistically and with an opportunity for discussion and clarification this be do no new aim be state in private that have not be state in public on either side the gap between we be not in such a short period materially reduce but at least the channel of communication be open more fully at least the chance of a dangerous misjudgment on either side should now be less and at least the man on whose decision the peace in part depend have agree to remain in contact

 this be important for neither of we try to merely please the other to agree merely to be agreeable to say what the other want to hear and just as our judicial system rely on witness appear in court and on cross examination instead of hearsay testimony or affidavit on paper so too be this direct give and take of immeasurable value in make clear and precise what we consider to be vital for the fact of the matter be that the soviets and ourselves give wholly different meaning to the same word war peace democracy and popular will

 we have wholly different view of right and wrong of what be an internal affair and what be aggression and above all we have wholly different concept of where the world be and where it be go

 only by such a discussion be it possible for i to be sure that mr. khrushchev know how differently we view the present and the future our view contrast sharply but at least we know well at the end where we both stand neither of we be there to dictate a settlement or to convert the other to a cause or to concede our basic interest but both of we be there i think because we realize that each nation have the power to inflict enormous damage upon the other that such a war could and should be avoid if at all possible since it would settle no dispute and prove no doctrine and that care should thus be take to prevent our conflict interest from so directly confront each other that war necessarily ensue we believe in a system of national freedom and independence he believe in an expand and dynamic concept of world communism and the question be whether these two system can ever hope to live in peace without permit any loss of security or any denial of the freedom of our friend however difficult it may seem to answer this question in the affirmative as we approach so many harsh test i think we owe it to all mankind to make every possible effort that be why i consider the vienna talk to be useful the somber mood that they convey be not cause for elation or relaxation nor be it cause for undue pessimism or fear it simply demonstrate how much work we in the free world have to do and how long and hard a struggle must be our fate as americans in this generation as the chief defender of the cause of liberty the one area which afford some immediate prospect of accord be laos both side recognize the need to reduce the danger in that situation both side endorse the concept of a neutral and independent laos much in the manner of burma or cambodia

 of critical importance to the current conference on laos in geneva both side recognize the importance of an effective cease fire it be urgent that this be translate into new attitude at geneva enable the international control commission to do its duty to make certain that a cease fire be enforce and maintain i be hopeful that progress can be make on this matter in the come day at geneva for that would greatly improve international atmosphere

 no such hope emerge however with respect to the other deadlocke geneva conference seek a treaty to ban nuclear test mr. khrushchev make it clear that there could not be a neutral administrator in his opinion because no one be truly neutral that a soviet veto would have to apply to act of enforcement that inspection be only a subterfuge for espionage in the absence of total disarmament and that the present test ban negotiation appear futile in short our hope for an end to nuclear test for an end to the spread of nuclear weapon and for some slow down of the arm race have be strike a serious blow nevertheless the stake be too important for we to abandon the draft treaty we have offer at geneva

 but our most somber talk be on the subject of germany and berlin i make it clear to mr. khrushchev that the security of western europe and therefore our own security be deeply involved in our presence and our access right to west berlin that those right be base on law and not on sufferance and that we be determined to maintain those right at any risk and thus meet our obligation to the people of west berlin and their right to choose their own future

 mr. khrushchev in turn present his view in detail and his presentation will be the subject of further communication but we be not seek to change the present situation a bind german peace treaty be a matter for all who be at war with germany and we and our ally can not abandon our obligation to the people of west berlin

 good night and thank you very much

admiral mr. secretary member of the joint chiefs of staff member of the faculty member of the graduating class and their family

 i be proud as a citizen of the united states to come to this institution and this room where there be concentrate so many man who have commit themselves to the defense of the united states i be honor to be here

 in the past i have have some slight contact with this service though i never do reach the state of professional and physical perfection where i could hope that anyone would ever mistake i for an annapolis graduate

 i know that you be constantly warn during your day here not to mix in your naval career in politic i should point out however on the other side that my rather rapid rise from a reserve lieutenant of uncertain standing to commander in chief have be because i do not follow that very good advice

 i trust however that those of you who be regulars will for a moment grant a retired civilian officer some measure of fellowship

 nearly a half century ago president woodrow wilson come here to annapolis on a similar mission and address the class of 1914 on that day the graduating class number 154 man there have be since that time a revolution in the size of our military establishment and that revolution have be reflect in the revolution in the world around we

 when wilson address the class in 1914 the victorian structure of power be still intact the world be dominate by europe and europe itself be the scene of an uneasy balance of power between dominant figure and america be a spectator on a remote sideline

 the autumn after wilson come to annapolis the victorian world begin to fall to piece and our world one half a century later be vastly different today we be witness to the most extraordinary revolution nearly in the history of the world as the emergent nation of latin america africa and asia awaken from long century of torpor and impatience

 today the victorian certitude 's which be take to be so much a part of man 's natural existence be under siege by a faith commit to the destruction of liberal civilization and today the united states be no long the spectator but the leader

 this half century therefore have not only revolutionize the size of our military establishment it have bring about also a more striking revolution in the thing that the nation expect from the man in our service

 fifty year ago the graduate of the naval academy be expect to be seaman and leader of man they be remind of the saying of john paul jones give i a fair ship so that i might go into harm 's way

 when captain mahan begin to write in the ninety on the general issue of war and peace and naval strategy the navy quickly ship he to sea duty today we expect all of you in fact you must of necessity be prepare not only to handle a ship in a storm or a landing party on a beach but to make great determination which affect the survival of this country

 the revolution in the technology of war make it necessary in order that you when you hold position of command may make an educate judgment between various technique that you also be a scientist and an engineer and a physicist and your responsibility go far beyond the classic problem of tactic and strategy

 in the year to come some of you will serve as your commandant do last year as an adviser to foreign government some will negotiate as admiral burke do in korea with other government on behalf of the united states some will go to the far reach of space and some will go to the bottom of the ocean many of you from one time or another in the position of command or as member of staff will participate in great decision which go far beyond the narrow reach of professional competence

 you gentleman therefore have a most important responsibility to recognize that your education be just begin and to be prepare in the most difficult period in the life of our country to play the role that the country hope and need and expect from you you must understand not only this country but other country you must know something about strategy and tactic and logic logistic but also economic and politic and diplomacy and history you must know everything you can know about military power and you must also understand the limit of military power you must understand that few of the important problem of our time have in the final analysis be finally solve by military power alone when i say that officer today must go far beyond the official curriculum i say it not because i do not believe in the traditional relationship between the civilian and the military but you must be more than the servant of national policy you must be prepare to play a constructive role in the development of national policy a policy which protect our interest and our security and the peace of the world woodrow wilson remind your predecessor that you be not serve a government or an administration but a people in serve the american people you represent the american people and the good of the ideal of this free society your posture and your performance will provide many people far beyond our shore who know very little of our country the only evidence they will ever see as to whether america be truly dedicated to the cause of justice and freedom

 in my inaugural address i say that each citizen should be concern not with what his country can do for he but what he can do for his country what you have choose to do for your country by devote your life to the service of our country be the great contribution that any man could make it be easy for you in a moment of exhilaration today to say that you freely and gladly dedicate your life to the united states but the life of service be a constant test of your will

 it will be hard at time to face the personal sacrifice and the family inconvenience to maintain this high resolve to place the need of your country above all else when there be a visible enemy to fight the tide of patriotism in this country run strong but when there be a long slow struggle with no immediate visible foe when you watch your contemporary indulge the urge for material gain and comfort and personal advancement your choice will seem hard and you will recall i be sure the line find in an old sentry box at gibraltar god and the soldier all man adore in time of trouble and no more for when war be over and all thing right god be neglect and the old soldier slight

 never forget however that the battle for freedom take many form those who through vigilance and firmness and devotion be the great servant of this country and let we have no doubt that the united states need your devoted assistance today

 the answer to those who challenge we so severely in so many part of the globe lie in our willingness to freely commit ourselves to the maintenance of our country and the thing for which it stand

 this ceremony today represent the kind of commitment which you be willing to make for that reason i be proud to be here this nation salute you as you commence your service to our country in the hazardous day ahead and on behalf of all of they i congratulate you and thank you

good evening

 seven week ago tonight i return from europe to report on my meeting with premier khrushchev and the other his grim warning about the future of the world his aide memoire on berlin his subsequent speech and threat which he and his agent have launch and the increase in the soviet military budget that he have announce have all prompt a series of decision by the administration and a series of consultation with the member of the nato organization in berlin as you recall he intend to bring to an end through a stroke of the pen first our legal right to be in west berlin and secondly our ability to make good on our commitment to the two million free people of that city that we can not permit

 we be clear about what must be do and we intend to do it i want to talk frankly with you tonight about the first step that we shall take these action will require sacrifice on the part of many of our citizen more will be require in the future they will require from all of we courage and perseverance in the year to come but if we and our ally act out of strength and unity of purpose with calm determination and steady nerve use restraint in our word as well as our weapon i be hopeful that both peace and freedom will be sustain

 the immediate threat to free man be in west berlin but that isolated outpost be not an isolated problem the threat be worldwide our effort must be equally wide and strong and not be obsess by any single manufacture crisis we face a challenge in berlin but there be also a challenge in southeast asia where the border be less guard the enemy hard to find and the danger of communism less apparent to those who have so little we face a challenge in our own hemisphere and indeed wherever else the freedom of human being be at stake

 let i remind you that the fortune of war and diplomacy leave the free people of west berlin in 1945 110 mile behind the iron curtain

 this map make very dear the problem that we face the white be west germany the east be the area control by the soviet union and as you can see from the chart west berlin be 110 mile within the area which the soviets now dominate which be immediately control by the so call east german regime

 we be there as a result of our victory over nazi germany and our basic right to be there derive from that victory include both our presence in west berlin and the enjoyment of access across east germany these right have be repeatedly confirm and recognize in special agreement with the soviet union berlin be not a part of east germany but a separate territory under the control of the allied power thus our right there be clear and deep rooted but in addition to those right be our commitment to sustain and defend if need be the opportunity for more than two million people to determine their own future and choose their own way of life

 thus our presence in west berlin and our access thereto can not be end by any act of the soviet government the nato shield be long ago extend to cover west berlin and we have give our word that an attack upon that city will be regard as an attack upon we all

 for west berlin lying expose 110 mile inside east germany surround by soviet troop and close to soviet supply line have many role it be more than a showcase of liberty a symbol an island of freedom in a communist sea it be even more than a link with the free world a beacon of hope behind the iron curtain an escape hatch for refugee

 west berlin be all of that but above all it have now become as never before the great testing place of western courage and will a focal point where our solemn commitment stretch back over the year since 1945 and soviet ambition now meet in basic confrontation

 it would be a mistake for other to look upon berlin because of its location as a tempting target the united states be there the united kingdom and france be there the pledge of nato be there and the people of berlin be there it be as secure in that sense as the rest of we for we can not separate its safety from our own

 i hear it say that west berlin be militarily untenable and so be bastogne and so in fact be stalingrad any dangerous spot be tenable if man brave man will make it so

 we do not want to fight but we have fight before and other in early time have make the same dangerous mistake of assume that the west be too selfish and too soft and too divided to resist invasion of freedom in other land those who threaten to unleash the force of war on a dispute over west berlin should recall the word of the ancient philosopher a man who cause fear can not be free from fear

 we can not and will not permit the communists to drive we out of berlin either gradually or by force for the fulfillment of our pledge to that city be essential to the morale and security of western germany to the unity of western europe and to the faith of the entire free world soviet strategy have long be aim not merely at berlin but at dividing and neutralize all of europe force we back on our own shore we must meet our oft state pledge to the free people of west berlin and maintain our right and their safety even in the face of force in order to maintain the confidence of other free people in our word and our resolve the strength of the alliance on which our security depend be dependent in turn on our willingness to meet our commitment to they

 so long as the communists insist that they be prepare to end by themselves unilaterally our right in west berlin and our commitment to its people we must be prepare to defend those right and those commitment we will at all time be ready to talk if talk will help but we must also be ready to resist with force if force be use upon we either alone would fail together they can serve the cause of freedom and peace

 the new preparation that we shall make to defend the peace be part of the long term build up in our strength which have be underway since january they be base on our need to meet a world wide threat on a basis which stretch far beyond the present berlin crisis our primary purpose be neither propaganda nor provocation but preparation

 a first need be to hasten progress toward the military goal which the north atlantic ally have set for themselves in europe today nothing less will suffice we will put even great resource into fulfil those goal and we look to our ally to do the same

 the supplementary defense build up that i ask from the congress in march and may have already start move we toward these and our other defense goal they include an increase in the size of the marine corps improve readiness of our reserve expansion of our air and sea lift and step up procurement of needed weapon ammunition and other item to insure a continue invulnerable capacity to deter or destroy any aggressor they provide for the strengthening of our missile power and for put 50 of our b-52 and b-47 bomber on a ground alert which would send they on their way with 15 minute warning

 these measure must be speed up and still other must now be take we must have sea and air lift capable of move our force quickly and in large number to any part of the world

 but even more importantly we need the capability of place in any critical area at the appropriate time a force which combine with those of our ally be large enough to make clear our determination and our ability to defend our right at all cost and to meet all level of aggressor pressure with whatever level of force be require we intend to have a wide choice than humiliation or all out nuclear action while it be unwise at this time either to call up or send abroad excessive number of these troop before they be need let i make it clear that i intend to take as time go on whatever step be necessary to make certain that such force can be deploy at the appropriate time without lessen our ability to meet our commitment elsewhere

 thus in the day and month ahead i shall not hesitate to ask the congress for additional measure or exercise any of the executive power that i possess to meet this threat to peace everything essential to the security of freedom must be do and if that should require more man or more taxis or more control or other new power i shall not hesitate to ask they the measure propose today will be constantly study and alter as necessary but while we will not let panic shape our policy neither will we permit timidity to direct our program

 accordingly i be now take the follow step

 1 i be tomorrow request the congress for the current fiscal year an additional $ 3,247,000,000 of appropriation for the armed forces

 2 to fill out our present army divisions and to make more man available for prompt deployment i be request an increase in the army 's total authorize strength from 875,000 to approximately 1 million man

 3 i be request an increase of 29,000 and 63,000 man respectively in the active duty strength of the navy and the air force

 4 to fulfill these manpower need i be order that our draft call be double and triple in the come month i be ask the congress for authority to order to active duty certain ready reserve unit and individual reservist and to extend tour of duty;2 and under that authority i be plan to order to active duty a number of air transport squadron and air national guard tactical air squadron to give we the airlift capacity and protection that we need other reserve force will be call up when need

 5 many ship and plane once head for retirement be to be retain or reactivate increase our airpower tactically and our sealift airlift and anti submarine warfare capability in addition our strategic air power will be increase by delay the deactivation of b-47 bomber

 6 finally some $ 1.8 billion about half of the total sum be need for the procurement of non nuclear weapon ammunition and equipment

 the detail on all these request will be present to the congress tomorrow subsequent step will be take to suit subsequent need comparable effort for the common defense be be discuss with our nato ally for their commitment and interest be as precise as our own

 and let i add that i be well aware of the fact that many american family will bear the burden of these request study or career will be interrupt husband and son will be call away income in some case will be reduce but these be burden which must be bear if freedom be to be defend americans have willingly bear they before and they will not flinch from the task now

 we have another sober responsibility to recognize the possibility of nuclear war in the missile age without our citizen know what they should do and where they should go if bomb begin to fall would be a failure of responsibility in may i pledge a new start on civil defense last week i assign on the recommendation of the civil defense director basic responsibility for this program to the secretary of defense to make certain it be administer and coordinate with our continental defense effort at the high civilian level tomorrow i be request of the congress new fund for the follow immediate objective to identify and mark space in exist structure public and private that could be use for fall out shelter in case of attack to stock those shelter with food water first aid kit and other minimum essential for survival to increase their capacity to improve our air raid warning and fall out detection system include a new household warning system which be now under development and to take other measure that will be effective at an early date to save million of life if need

 in the event of an attack the life of those family which be not hit in a nuclear blast and fire can still be save if they can be warn to take shelter and if that shelter be available we owe that kind of insurance to our family and to our country in contrast to our friend in europe the need for this kind of protection be new to our shore but the time to start be now in the come month i hope to let every citizen know what step he can take without delay to protect his family in case of attack i know that you will want to do no less

 the addition of $ 207 million in civil defense appropriation bring our total new defense budget request to $ 3.454 billion and a total of $ 47 5 billion for the year this be an increase in the defense budget of $ 6 billion since january and have result in official estimate of a budget deficit of over $ 5 billion the secretary of the treasury and other economic adviser assure i however that our economy have the capacity to bear this new request

 we be recover strongly from this year 's recession the increase in this last quarter of our year of our total national output be great than that for any postwar period of initial recovery and yet wholesale price be actually low than they be during the recession and consumer price be only 1/4 of 1 high than they be last october in fact this last quarter be the first in eight year in which our production have increase without an increase in the overall price index and for the first time since the fall of 1959 our gold position have improve and the dollar be more respected abroad these gain it should be stress be be accomplish with budget deficit far small than those of the 1958 recession

 this improved business outlook mean improved revenue and i intend to submit to the congress in january a budget for the next fiscal year which will be strictly in balance nevertheless should an increase in taxis be need because of event in the next few month to achieve that balance or because of subsequent defense rise those increase taxis will be request in january

 meanwhile to help make certain that the current deficit be hold to a safe level we must keep down all expenditure not thoroughly justify in budget request the luxury of our current post office deficit must be end cost in military procurement will be closely scrutinize and in this effort i welcome the cooperation of the congress the tax loophole i have specify on expense account overseas income dividend interest coo operative and other must be close

 i realize that no public revenue measure be welcome by everyone but i be certain that every american want to pay his fair share and not leave the burden of defend freedom entirely to those who bear arm for we have mortgage our very future on this defense and we can not fail to meet our responsibility

 but i must emphasize again that the choice be not merely between resistance and retreat between atomic holocaust and surrender our peace time military posture be traditionally defensive but our diplomatic posture need not be our response to the berlin crisis will not be merely military or negative it will be more than merely stand firm for we do not intend to leave it to other to choose and monopolize the forum and the framework of discussion we do not intend to abandon our duty to mankind to seek a peaceful solution

 as signer of the un charter we shall always be prepare to discuss international problem with any and all nation that be willing to talk and listen with reason if they have proposal not demand we shall hear they if they seek genuine understanding not concession of our right we shall meet with they we have previously indicate our readiness to remove any actual irritant in west berlin but the freedom of that city be not negotiable we can not negotiate with those who say what be mine be mine and what be yours be negotiable but we be willing to consider any arrangement or treaty in germany consistent with the maintenance of peace and freedom and with the legitimate security interest of all nation

 we recognize the soviet union 's historical concern about their security in central and eastern europe after a series of ravage invasion and we believe arrangement can be work out which will help to meet those concern and make it possible for both security and freedom to exist in this troubled area

 for it be not the freedom of west berlin which be abnormal in germany today but the situation in that entire divided country if anyone doubt the legality of our right in berlin we be ready to have it submit to international adjudication if anyone doubt the extent to which our presence be desire by the people of west berlin compare to east german feeling about their regime we be ready to have that question submit to a free vote in berlin and if possible among all the german people and let we hear at that time from the two and one half million refugee who have flee the communist regime in east germany voting for western type freedom with their foot

 the world be not deceive by the communist attempt to label berlin as a hot bed of war there be peace in berlin today the source of world trouble and tension be moscow not berlin and if war begin it will have begin in moscow and not berlin

 for the choice of peace or war be largely theirs not ours it be the soviets who have stir up this crisis it be they who be try to force a change it be they who have oppose free election it be they who have reject an all german peace treaty and the ruling of international law and as americans know from our history on our own old frontier gun battle be cause by outlaw and not by officer of the peace

 in short while we be ready to defend our interest we shall also be ready to search for peace in quiet exploratory talk in formal or informal meeting we do not want military consideration to dominate the thinking of either east or west and mr. khrushchev may find that his invitation to other nation to join in a meaningless treaty may lead to their invite he to join in the community of peaceful man in abandon the use of force and in respect the sanctity of agreement

 while all of these effort go on we must not be divert from our total responsibility from other danger from other task if new threat in berlin or elsewhere should cause we to weaken our program of assistance to the develop nation who be also under heavy pressure from the same source or to halt our effort for realistic disarmament or to disrupt or slow down our economy or to neglect the education of our child then those threat will surely be the most successful and least costly maneuver in communist history for we can afford all these effort and more but we can not afford not to meet this challenge

 and the challenge be not to we alone it be a challenge to every nation which assert its sovereignty under a system of liberty it be a challenge to all those who want a world of free choice it be a special challenge to the atlantic community the heartland of human freedom

 we in the west must move together in build military strength we must consult one another more closely than ever before we must together design our proposal for peace and labor together as they be press at the conference table and together we must share the burden and the risk of this effort

 the atlantic community as we know it have be build in response to challenge the challenge of european chaos in 1947 of the berlin blockade in 1948 the challenge of communist aggression in korea in 1950 now stand strong and prosperous after an unprecedented decade of progress the atlantic community will not forget either its history or the principle which give it meaning

 the solemn vow each of we give to west berlin in time of peace will not be break in time of danger if we do not meet our commitment to berlin where will we later stand if we be not true to our word there all that we have achieve in collective security which rely on these word will mean nothing and if there be one path above all other to war it be the path of weakness and disunity

 today the endanger frontier of freedom run through divide berlin we want it to remain a frontier of peace this be the hope of every citizen of the atlantic community every citizen of eastern europe and i be confident every citizen of the soviet union for i can not believe that the russian people who bravely suffer enormous loss in the second world war would now wish to see the peace upset once more in germany the soviet government alone can convert berlin 's frontier of peace into a pretext for war

 the step i have indicate tonight be aim at avoid that war to sum it all up we seek peace but we shall not surrender that be the central meaning of this crisis and the meaning of your government 's policy

 with your help and the help of other free man this crisis can be surmount freedom can prevail and peace can endure

 i would like to close with a personal word when i run for the presidency of the united states i know that this country face serious challenge but i could not realize nor could any man realize who do not bear the burden of this office how heavy and constant would be those burden

 three time in my life time our country and europe have be involve in major war in each case serious misjudgment be make on both side of the intention of other which bring about great devastation

 now in the thermonuclear age any misjudgment on either side about the intention of the other could rain more devastation in several hour than have be work in all the war of human history

 therefore i as president and commander in chief and all of we as americans be move through serious day i shall bear this responsibility under our constitution for the next three and one half year but i be sure that we all regardless of our occupation will do our very good for our country and for our cause for all of we want to see our child grow up in a country at peace and in a world where freedom endure

 i know that sometimes we get impatient we wish for some immediate action that would end our peril but i must tell you that there be no quick and easy solution the communists control over a billion people and they recognize that if we should falter their success would be imminent

 we must look to long day ahead which if we be courageous and persevering can bring we what we all desire

 in these day and week i ask for your help and your advice i ask for your suggestion when you think we could do well

 all of we i know love our country and we shall all do our good to serve it

 in meet my responsibility in these coming month as president i need your good will and your support and above all your prayer

 thank you and good night

mr. president honor delegate lady and gentleman

 we meet in an hour of grief and challenge dag hammarskjold be dead but the united nations live his tragedy be deep in our heart but the task for which he die be at the top of our agenda a noble servant of peace be go but the quest for peace lie before we

 the problem be not the death of one man the problem be the life of this organization it will either grow to meet the challenge of our age or it will be go with the wind without influence without force without respect be we to let it die to enfeeble its vigor to cripple its power we would condemn our future

 for in the development of this organization rest the only true alternative to war and war appeal no long as a rational alternative unconditional war can no long lead to unconditional victory it can no long serve to settle dispute it can no long concern the great power alone for a nuclear disaster spread by wind and water and fear could well engulf the great and the small the rich and the poor the committed and the uncommitted alike mankind must put an end to war or war will put an end to mankind

 so let we here resolve that dag hammarskjold do not live or die in vain let we call a truce to terror let we invoke the blessing of peace and as we build an international capacity to keep peace let we join in dismantle the national capacity to wage war

 this will require new strength and new role for the united nations for disarmament without check be but a shadow and a community without law be but a shell already the united nations have become both the measure and the vehicle of man 's most generous impulse already it have provide in the middle east in asia in africa this year in the congo a means of hold man 's violence within bound

 but the great question which confront this body in 1945 be still before we whether man 's cherish hope for progress and peace be to be destroy by terror and disruption whether the foul wind of war can be tame in time to free the cool wind of reason and whether the pledge of our charter be to be fulfil or defy pledge to secure peace progress human right and world law

 in this hall there be not three force but two one be compose of those who be try to build the kind of world describe in articles i and ii of the charter the other seek a far different world would undermine this organization in the process

 today of all day our dedication to the charter must be maintain it must be strengthen first of all by the selection of an outstanding civil servant to carry forward the responsibility of the secretary general a man endow with both the wisdom and the power to make meaningful the moral force of the world community the late secretary general nurture and sharpen the united nations obligation to act but he do not invent it it be there in the charter it be still there in the charter

 however difficult it may be to fill mr. hammarskjold 's place it can well be fill by one man rather than by three even the three horse of the troika do not have three driver all go in different direction they have only one and so must the united nations executive to install a triumvirate or any panel or any rotate authority in the united nations administrative office would replace order with anarchy action with paralysis confidence with confusion

 the secretary general in a very real sense be the servant of the general assembly diminish his authority and you diminish the authority of the only body where all nation regardless of power be equal and sovereign until all the powerful be just the weak will be secure only in the strength of this assembly

 effective and independent executive action be not the same question as balanced representation in view of the enormous change in membership in this body since its founding the american delegation will join in any effort for the prompt review and revision of the composition of united nations body

 but to give this organization three driver to permit each great power to decide its own case would entrench the cold war in the headquarters of peace whatever advantage such a plan may hold out to my own country as one of the great power we reject it for we far prefer world law in the age of self determination to world war in the age of mass extermination

 today every inhabitant of this planet must contemplate the day when this planet may no long be habitable every man woman and child live under a nuclear sword of damocles hang by the slender of thread capable of be cut at any moment by accident or miscalculation or by madness the weapon of war must be abolish before they abolish we

 man no long debate whether armament be a symptom or a cause of tension the mere existence of modern weapon ten million time more powerful than any that the world have ever see and only minute away from any target on earth be a source of horror and discord and distrust man no long maintain that disarmament must await the settlement of all dispute for disarmament must be a part of any permanent settlement and man may no long pretend that the quest for disarmament be a sign of weakness for in a spiral arm race a nation 's security may well be shrink even as its arm increase

 for 15 year this organization have seek the reduction and destruction of arm now that goal be no long a dream it be a practical matter of life or death the risk inherent in disarmament pale in comparison to the risk inherent in an unlimited arm race

 it be in this spirit that the recent belgrade conference recognize that this be no long a soviet problem or an american problem but a human problem endorse a program of general complete and strictly an internationally control disarmament it be in this same spirit that we in the united states have labor this year with a new urgency and with a new now statutory agency fully endorse by the congress to find an approach to disarmament which would be so far reach yet realistic so mutually balanced and beneficial that it could be accept by every nation and it be in this spirit that we have present with the agreement of the soviet union under the label both nation now accept of general and complete disarmament"--a new statement of newly agree principle for negotiation

 but we be well aware that all issue of principle be not settle and that principle alone be not enough it be therefore our intention to challenge the soviet union not to an arm race but to a peace race to advance together step by step stage by stage until general and complete disarmament have be achieve we invite they now to go beyond agreement in principle to reach agreement on actual plan

 the program to be present to this assembly for general and complete disarmament under effective international control move to bridge the gap between those who insist on a gradual approach and those who talk only of the final and total achievement it would create machinery to keep the peace as it destroy the machinery of war it would proceed through balanced and safeguard stage design to give no state a military advantage over another it would place the final responsibility for verification and control where it belong not with the big power alone not with one 's adversary or one 's self but in an international organization within the framework of the united nations it would assure that indispensable condition of disarmament true inspection and apply it in stage proportionate to the stage of disarmament it would cover delivery system as well as weapon it would ultimately halt their production as well as their testing their transfer as well as their possession it would achieve under the eye of an international disarmament organization a steady reduction in force both nuclear and conventional until it have abolish all army and all weapon except those need for internal order and a new united nations peace force and it start that process now today even as the talk begin

 in short general and complete disarmament must no long be a slogan use to resist the first step it be no long to be a goal without mean of achieve it without mean of verify its progress without mean of keep the peace it be now a realistic plan and a test a test of those only willing to talk and a test of those willing to act

 such a plan would not bring a world free from conflict and greed but it would bring a world free from the terror of mass destruction it would not usher in the era of the super state but it would usher in an era in which no state could annihilate or be annihilate by another

 in 1945 this nation propose the baruch plan to internationalize the atom before other nation even possess the bomb or demilitarize their troop we propose with our ally the disarmament plan of 1951 while still at war in korea and we make our proposal today while build up our defense over berlin not because we be inconsistent or insincere or intimidate but because we know the right of free man will prevail because while we be compel against our will to rearm we look confidently beyond berlin to the kind of disarm world we all prefer

 i therefore propose on the basis of this plan that disarmament negotiation resume promptly and continue without interruption until an entire program for general and complete disarmament have not only be agree but have be actually achieve

 the logical place to begin be a treaty assure the end of nuclear test of all kind in every environment under workable control the united states and the united kingdom have propose such a treaty that be both reasonable effective and ready for signature we be still prepared to sign that treaty today

 we also propose a mutual ban on atmospheric testing without inspection or control in order to save the human race from the poison of radioactive fallout we regret that that offer have not be accept

 for 15 year we have seek to make the atom an instrument of peaceful growth rather than of war but for 15 year our concession have be match by obstruction our patience by intransigence and the plea of mankind for peace have meet with disregard

 finally as the explosion of other becloud the sky my country be leave with no alternative but to act in the interest of its own and the free world 's security we can not endanger that security by refrain from testing while other improve their arsenal nor can we endanger it by another long un inspect ban on testing for three year we accept those risk in our open society while seek agreement on inspection but this year while we be negotiate in good faith in geneva other be secretly prepare new experiment in destruction

 our test be not pollute the atmosphere our deterrent weapon be guard against accidental explosion or use our doctor and scientist stand ready to help any nation measure and meet the hazard to health which inevitably result from the test in the atmosphere

 but to halt the spread of these terrible weapon to halt the contamination of the air to halt the spiral nuclear arm race we remain ready to seek new avenue of agreement our new disarmament program thus include the follow proposal

 --first sign the test ban treaty by all nation this can be do now test ban negotiation need not and should not await general disarmament

 --second stop the production of fissionable material for use in weapon and prevent their transfer to any nation now lack in nuclear weapon

 --third prohibit the transfer of control over nuclear weapon to state that do not own they

 --fourth keep nuclear weapon from seed new battleground in outer space

 --fifth gradually destroy exist nuclear weapon and convert their material to peaceful use and

 --finally halt the unlimited testing and production of strategic nuclear delivery vehicle and gradually destroy they as well

 to destroy arm however be not enough we must create even as we destroy create worldwide law and law enforcement as we outlaw worldwide war and weapon in the world we seek the united nations emergency forces which have be hastily assemble uncertainly supply and inadequately finance will never be enough

 therefore the united states recommend the president that all member nation earmark special peace keep unit in their armed force to be on call of the united nations to be specially train and quickly available and with advance provision for financial and logistic support

 in addition the american delegation will suggest a series of step to improve the united nations machinery for the peaceful settlement of dispute for on the spot fact finding mediation and adjudication for extend the rule of international law for peace be not solely a matter of military or technical problem it be primarily a problem of politic and people and unless man can match his stride in weaponry and technology with equal stride in social and political development our great strength like that of the dinosaur will become incapable of proper control and like the dinosaur vanish from the earth

 as we extend the rule of law on earth so must we also extend it to man 's new domain outer space

 all of we salute the brave cosmonaut of the soviet union the new horizon of outer space must not be drive by the old bitter concept of imperialism and sovereign claim the cold reach of the universe must not become the new arena of an even cold war

 to this end we shall urge proposal extend the united nations charter to the limit of man 's exploration in the universe reserve outer space for peaceful use prohibit weapon of mass destruction in space or on celestial body and open the mystery and benefit of space to every nation we shall propose further cooperative effort between all nation in weather prediction and eventually in weather control we shall propose finally a global system of communication satellite link the whole world in telegraph and telephone and radio and television the day need not be fat away when such a system will televise the proceeding of this body to every corner of the world for the benefit of peace

 but the mystery of outer space must not divert our eye or our energy from the harsh reality that face our fellow man political sovereignty be but a mockery without the mean of meet poverty and literacy and disease self determination be but a slogan if the future hold no hope

 that be why my nation which have freely share its capital and its technology to help other help themselves now propose officially designate this decade of the 1960 's as the united nations decade of development under the framework of that resolution the united nations exist effort in promote economic growth can be expand and coordinate regional survey and training institute can now pool the talent of many new research technical assistance and pilot project can unlock the wealth of less developed land and untapped water and development can become a cooperative and not a competitive enterprise to enable all nation however diverse in their system and belief to become in fact as well as in law free and equal nation

 my country favor a world of free and equal state we agree with those who say that colonialism be a key issue in this assembly but let the full fact of that issue be discuss in full

 on the one hand be the fact that since the close of world war ii a worldwide declaration of independence have transform nearly 1 billion people and 9 million square mile into 42 free and independent state less than 2 percent of the world 's population now live in dependent territory

 i do not ignore the remain problem of traditional colonialism which still confront this body those problem will be solve with patience good will and determination within the limit of our responsibility in such matter my country intend to be a participant and not merely an observer in the peaceful expeditious movement of nation from the status of colony to the partnership of equal that continue tide of self determination which run so strong have our sympathy and our support

 but colonialism in its harsh form be not only the exploitation of new nation by old of dark skin by light or the subjugation of the poor by the rich my nation be once a colony and we know what colonialism mean the exploitation and subjugation of the weak by the powerful of the many by the few of the govern who have give no consent to be govern whatever their continent their class or their color

 and that be why there be no ignore the fact that the tide of self determination have not reach the communist empire where a population far large than that officially term dependent life under government instal by foreign troop instead of free institution under a system which know only one party and one belief which suppress free debate and free election and free newspaper and free book and free trade union and which build a wall to keep truth a stranger and its own citizen prisoner let we debate colonialism in full and apply the principle of free choice and the practice of free plebiscite in every corner of the globe

 finally as president of the united states i consider it my duty to report to this assembly on two threat to the peace which be not on your crowded agenda but which cause we and most of you the deep concern

 the first threat on which i wish to report be widely misunderstood the smolder coal of war in southeast asia south viet nam be already under attack sometimes by a single assassin sometimes by a band of guerrilla recently by full battalion the peaceful border of burma cambodia and india have be repeatedly violate and the peaceful people of laos be in danger of lose the independence they gain not so long ago

 no one can call these war of liberation for these be free country live under their own government nor be these aggression any less real because man be knife in their home and not shoot in the field of battle

 the very simple question confront the world community be whether measure can be devise to protect the small and the weak from such tactic for if they be successful in laos and south viet nam the gate will be open wide

 the united states seek for itself no base no territory no special position in this area of any kind we support a truly neutral and independent laos its people free from outside interference live at peace with themselves and with their neighbor assure that their territory will not be use for attack on other and under a government comparable as mr. khrushchev and i agree at vienna to cambodia and burma

 but now the negotiation over laos be reach a crucial stage the cease fire be at well precarious the rainy season be come to an end laotian territory be be use to infiltrate south viet nam the world community must recognize and all those who be involve that this potent threat to laotian peace and freedom be indivisible from all other threat to their own

 secondly i wish to report to you on the crisis over germany and berlin this be not the time or the place for immoderate tone but the world community be entitle to know the very simple issue as we see they if there be a crisis it be because an exist peace be under threat because an exist island of free people be under pressure because solemn agreement be be treat with indifference establish international right be be threaten with unilateral usurpation peaceful circulation have be interrupt by barbed wire and concrete block

 one recall the order of the czar in pushkin 's boris godunov take step at this very hour that our frontier be fence in by barrier that not a single soul pass o'er the border that not a hare be able to run or a crow to fly

 it be absurd to allege that we be threaten a war merely to prevent the soviet union and east germany from sign a so call treaty of peace the western allies be not concerned with any paper arrangement the soviets may wish to make with a regime of their own creation on territory occupy by their own troop and govern by their own agent no such action can affect either our right or our responsibility

 if there be a dangerous crisis in berlin and there be it be because of threat against the vital interest and the deep commitment of the western powers and the freedom of west berlin we can not yield these interest we can not fail these commitment we can not surrender the freedom of these people for whom we be responsible a peace treaty which carry with it the provision which destroy the peace would be a fraud a free city which be not genuinely free would suffocate freedom and would be an infamy

 for a city or a people to be truly free they must have the secure right without economic political or police pressure to make their own choice and to live their own life and as i have say before if anyone doubt the extent to which our presence be desire by the people of west berlin we be ready to have that question submit to a free vote in all berlin and if possible among all the german people

 the elementary fact about this crisis be that it be unnecessary the elementary tool for a peaceful settlement be to be find in the charter under its law agreement be to be keep unless change by all those who make they establish right be to be respect the political disposition of people should rest upon their own wish freely express in plebiscite or free election if there be legal problem they can be solve by legal mean if there be a threat of force it must be reject if there be desire for change it must be a subject for negotiation and if there be negotiation it must be root in mutual respect and concern for the right of other

 the western powers have calmly resolve to defend by whatever mean be force upon they their obligation and their access to the free citizen of west berlin and the self determination of those citizen this generation learn from bitter experience that either brandish or yield to threat can only lead to war but firmness and reason can lead to the kind of peaceful solution in which my country profoundly believe

 we be committed to no rigid formula we see no perfect solution we recognize that troop and tank can for a time keep a nation divide against its will however unwise that policy may seem to we but we believe a peaceful agreement be possible which protect the freedom of west berlin and ally presence and access while recognize the historic and legitimate interest of other in assure european security

 the possibility of negotiation be now be explore it be too early to report what the prospect may be for our part we would be glad to report at the appropriate time that a solution have be find for there be no need for a crisis over berlin threaten the peace and if those who create this crisis desire peace there will be peace and freedom in berlin

 the event and decision of the next ten month may well decide the fate of man for the next ten thousand year there will be no avoid those event there will be no appeal from these decision and we in this hall shall be remember either as part of the generation that turn this planet into a flaming funeral pyre or the generation that meet its vow to save succeed generation from the scourge of war

 in the endeavor to meet that vow i pledge you every effort this nation possess i pledge you that we shall neither commit nor provoke aggression that we shall neither flee nor invoke the threat of force that we shall never negotiate out of fear we shall never fear to negotiate

 terror be not a new weapon throughout history it have be use by those who could not prevail either by persuasion or example but inevitably they fail either because man be not afraid to die for a life worth living or because the terrorist themselves come to realize that free man can not be frighten by threat and that aggression would meet its own response and it be in the light of that history that every nation today should know be he friend or foe that the united states have both the will and the weapon to join free man in stand up to their responsibility

 but i come here today to look across this world of threat to a world of peace in that search we can not expect any final triumph for new problem will always arise we can not expect that all nation will adopt like system for conformity be the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth nor can we expect to reach our goal by contrivance by fiat or even by the wish of all but however close we sometimes seem to that dark and final abyss let no man of peace and freedom despair for he do not stand alone if we all can persevere if we can in every land and office look beyond our own shore and ambition then surely the age will dawn in which the strong be just and the weak secure and the peace preserve

 lady and gentleman of this assembly the decision be ours never have the nation of the world have so much to lose or so much to gain together we shall save our planet or together we shall perish in its flame save it we can and save it we must and then shall we earn the eternal thank of mankind and as peacemaker the eternal blessing of god





mr. chancellor governor sanford member of the faculty lady and gentleman

 i be honor today to be admit to the fellowship of this ancient and distinguished university and i be pleased to receive in the short space of 1 or 2 minute the honor for which you spend over 4 year of your life but whether the degree be honorary or earn it be a proud symbol of this university and this state

 north carolina have long be identify with enlighten and progressive leader and people and i can think of no more important reason for that reputation than this university which year after year have send educate man and woman who have have a recognition of their public responsibility as well as in their private interest

 distinguished president like president graham and gray distinguished leader like the secretary of commerce governor hodges distinguished member of the congressional delegation carry out a tradition which stretch back to the beginning of this school and that be that the graduate of this university be a man of his nation as well as a man of his time and it be my hope in a change world when untold possibility lie before north carolina and indeed the entire south and country that this university will still hew to the old line of the responsibility that its graduate owe to the community at large that in your time too you will be willing to give to the state and country a portion of your life and all of your knowledge and all of your loyalty

 i want to emphasize in the great concentration which we now place upon scientist and engineer how much we still need the man and woman educate in the liberal tradition willing to take the long look undisturbe by prejudice and slogan of the moment who attempt to make an honest judgment on difficult event

 this university have a more important function today than ever before and therefore i be proud as president of the united states and as a graduate of a small land grant college in massachusetts harvard university to come to this center of education

 those of you who regard my profession of political life with some disdain should remember that it make it possible for i to move from be an obscure lieutenant in the united states navy to commander in chief in 14 year with very little technical competence

 but more than that i hope that you will realize that from the beginning of this country and especially in north carolina there have be the close link between educated man and woman and politic and government and also to remember that our nation 's first great leader be also our first great scholar

 a contemporary describe thomas jefferson as a gentleman of 32 who could calculate an eclipse survey an estate tie an artery plan an edifice try a cause break a horse dance the minuet and play the violin john quincy adams after be summarily dismiss by the massachusetts legislature from the united states senate for support thomas jefferson could then become boylston professor of rhetoric and oratory at harvard university and then become a great secretary of state

 and senator daniel webster could stroll down the corridor of the congress a few step after make some of the great speech in the history of this country and dominate the supreme court as the foremost lawyer of his day

 this versatility this vitality this intellectual energy put to the service of our country represent our great resource in these difficult day

 i would urge you therefore regardless of your specialty and regardless of your choose field or occupation and regardless of whether you bear office or not that you recognize the contribution which you can make as educate man and woman to intellectual and political leadership in these difficult day when the problem be infinitely more complicated and come with increase speed with increase significance in our life than they be a century ago when so many gifted man dominate our political life the united states senate have more able man serve in it from the period of 1830 to 1850 than probably any time in our history and yet they deal with three or four problem which they have deal with for over a generation

 now they come day by day from all part of the world even the expert find themselves confuse and therefore in a free society such as this where the people must make an educate judgment they depend upon those of you who have have the advantage of the scholar 's education

 i ask you to give to the service of our country the critical faculty which society have help develop in you here i ask you to decide as goethe put it whether you will be an anvil or a hammer whether you will give the united states in which you be rear and educate the broad possible benefit of that education

 it be not enough to lend your talent to deplore present solution most educate man and woman on occasion prefer to discuss what be wrong rather than to suggest alternative course of action but would you have count he a friend of ancient greece as george william curtis ask a body of educator a century ago would you have count he a friend of ancient greece who quietly discuss the theory of patriotism on that hot summer day through whose hopeless and immortal hour leonidas and the three hundred stand at thermopylae for liberty be john milton to conjugate greek verb in his library when the liberty of englishmen be imperil

 this be a great institution with a great tradition and with devoted alumnus and with the support of the people of this state its establishment and continue functioning like that of all great university have require great sacrifice by the people of north carolina i can not believe that all of this be undertake merely to give this school 's graduate an economic advantage in the lifestruggle

 a university say professor woodrow wilson should be an organ of memory for the state for the transmission of its good tradition and prince bismarck be even more specific one third of the student of german university he once say break down from over work another third break down from dissipation and the other third rule germany i leave it to each of you to decide in which category you will fall

 i do not suggest that our political and public life should be turn over to college train expert nor would i give this university a seat in the congress as william and mary be once represent in the virginia house of burgesses nor would i adopt from the belgian constitution a provision give three vote instead of one to college graduate at least not until more democrats go to college but i do hope that you join we

 this university produce train man and woman and what this country need be those who look as the motto of your state say at thing as they be and not at thing as they seem to be

 for this meeting be hold at an extraordinary time angola and algeria brazil and bizerte syria and south viet nam korea or kuwait the dominican republic berlin the united nations itself all problem which 20 year ago we could not even dream of

 our task in this country be to do our good to serve our nation 's interest as we see it and not to be sway from our course by the faint hearted or the unknowing or the threat of those who would make themselves our foe

 this be not a simple task in a democracy we can not open all our book in advance to an adversary who operate in the night the decision we make the weapon we possess the bargain we will accept nor can we always see reflect overnight the success or failure of the action that we may take

 in time past a simple slogan describe our policy fifty four forty or fight to make the world safe for democracy no entangle alliance but the time issue and the weapon all have change and complicate and endanger our life it be a dangerous illusion to believe that the policy of the united states stretch as they do world wide under vary and different condition can be encompass in one slogan or one adjective hard or soft or otherwise or to believe that we shall soon meet total victory or total defeat

 peace and freedom do not come cheap and we be destine all of we here today to live out most if not all of our life in uncertainty and challenge and peril our policy must therefore blend whatever degree of firmness and flexibility which be necessary to protect our vital interest by peaceful mean if possible by resolute action if necessary

 there be of course no place in america where reason and firmness be more clearly point out than here in north carolina all americans can profit from what happen in this state a century ago it be this state firmly fix in the tradition of the south which seek a way of reason in a troubled and dangerous world yet when the war come north carolina provide a fourth of all of the confederate soldier who make the supreme sacrifice in those year and it win the right to the slogan first at bethel farthest to the front at gettysburg and chickamauga last at appomattox

 its quest for a peaceful resolution of our problem be never identify in the mind of its people of people today with anything but a desire for peace and a preparation to meet their responsibility

 we move for the first time in our history through an age in which two oppose power have the capacity to destroy each other and while we do not intend to see the free world give up we shall make every effort to prevent the world from be blow up

 the american eagle on our official seal emphasize both peace and freedom and as i say in the state of the union address we in this country give equal attention to its claw when it in its left hand hold the arrow and in its right the olive branch

 this be a time of national maturity understanding and willingness to face issue as they be not as we would like they to be it be a test of our ability to be far seeing and calm as well as resolute to keep an eye on both our danger and our opportunity and not to be divert by momentary gain or setback or pressure and it be the long view of the educate citizen to which the graduate of this university can well contribute

 we must distinguish the real from the illusory the long range from the temporary the significant from the petty but if we can be purposeful if we can face up to our risk and live up to our word if we can do our duty undeterred by fanatic or frenzy at home or abroad then surely peace and freedom can prevail we shall be neither red nor dead but alive and free and worthy of the tradition and responsibility of north carolina and the united states of america

general gavan mr. gleason member of the military force veteran fellow americans

 today we be here to celebrate and to honor and to commemorate the dead and the living the young man who in every war since this country begin have give testimony to their loyalty to their country and their own great courage

 i do not believe that any nation in the history of the world have bury its soldier far from its native soil than we americans or bury they close to the town in which they grow up

 we celebrate this veterans day for a very few minute a few second of silence and then this country 's life go on but i think it most appropriate that we recall on this occasion and on every other moment when we be face with great responsibility the contribution and the sacrifice which so many man and their family have make in order to permit this country to now occupy its present position of responsibility and freedom and in order to permit we to gather here together

 bruce catton after total the casualty which take place in the battle of antietam not so very far from this cemetery when he look at statistic which show that in the short space of a few minute whole regiment lose 50 to 75 percent of their number then write that life perhaps be not the most precious gift of all that man die for the possession of a few foot of a corn field or a rocky hill or for almost nothing at all but in a very large sense they die that this country might be permit to go on and that it might permit to be fulfil the great hope of its founder

 in a world torment by tension and the possibility of conflict we meet in a quiet commemoration of an historic day of peace in an age that threaten the survival of freedom we join together to honor those who make our freedom possible the resolution of the congress which first proclaim armistice day describe november 11 1918 as the end of the most destructive sanguinary and far reach war in the history of human annal that resolution express the hope that the first world war would be in truth the war to end all war it suggest that those man who have die have therefore not give their life in vain

 it be a tragic fact that these hope have not be fulfil that war still more destructive and still more sanguinary follow that man 's capacity to devise new way of kill his fellow man have far outstrip his capacity to live in peace with his fellow man

 some might say therefore that this day have lose its meaning that the shadow of the new and deadly weapon have rob this day of its great value that whatever name we now give this day whatever flag we fly or prayer we utter it be too late to honor those who die before and too soon to promise the living an end to organized death

 but let we not forget that november 11 1918 signify a beginning as well as an end the purpose of all war say augustine be peace the first world war produce man 's first great effort in recent time to solve by international cooperation the problem of war that experiment continue in our present day still imperfect still short of its responsibility but it do offer a hope that some day nation can live in harmony

 for our part we shall achieve that peace only with patience and perseverance and courage the patience and perseverance necessary to work with ally of diverse interest but common goal the courage necessary over a long period of time to overcome an adversary skilled in the art of harassment and obstruction

 there be no way to maintain the frontier of freedom without cost and commitment and risk there be no swift and easy path to peace in our generation no man who witness the tragedy of the last war no man who can imagine the unimaginable possibility of the next war can advocate war out of irritability or frustration or impatience

 but let no nation confuse our perseverance and patience with fear of war or unwillingness to meet our responsibility we can not save ourselves by abandon those who be associate with we or reject our responsibility

 in the end the only way to maintain the peace be to be prepare in the final extreme to fight for our country and to mean it

 as a nation we have little capacity for deception we can convince friend and foe alike that we be in earnest about the defense of freedom only if we be in earnest and i can assure the world that we be

 this cemetery be first establish 97 year ago in this hill be first bury man who die in an early war a savage war here in our own country ninety seven year ago today the man in gray be retire from antietam where thousand of their comrade have fall between dawn and dusk in one terrible day and the man in blue be move towards fredericksburg where thousand would soon lie by a stone wall in heroic and sometimes miserable death

 it be a crucial moment in our nation 's history but these memory sad and proud these quiet ground this cemetery and other like it all around the world remind we with pride of our obligation and our opportunity

 on this veterans day of 1961 on this day of remembrance let we pray in the name of those who have fight in this country 's war and most especially who have fight in the first world war and in the second world war that there will be no veteran of any further war not because all shall have perish but because all shall have learn to live together in peace

 and to the dead here in this cemetery we say
 they be the race--

 they be the race immortal
 whose beam make broad

 the common light of day
 though time may dim

 though death have bar their portal
 these we salute
 which nameless pass away

president odegaard member o the regent member of the faculty student lady and gentleman
 it be a great honor on behalf of the people of the united states to extend to you congratulation on the centennial anniversary of this university which represent 100 year of service to this state and country
 this nation in two of the most critical time in the life of our country once in the day after the revolution in the northwest ordinance to which doctor odegaard refer and again during the most difficult day of the civil war in the morrill act which establish our land grant college this nation make a basic commitment to the maintenance of education for the very reason which thomas jefferson give that if this nation be to remain free it could not remain ignorant the basis of self government and freedom require the development of character and self restraint and perseverance and the long view and these be quality which require many year of training and education so that i think this university and other like it across the country and its graduate have recognize that these school be not maintain by the people of the various states in order to merely give the graduate of these school an economic advantage in the life struggle rather these school be support by our people because our people realize that this country have need in the past and need today as never before educate man and woman who be commit to the cause of freedom so for what this university have do in the past and what its graduate can do now and in the future i salute you
 this university be round when the civil war be already on and no one could be sure in 1861 whether this country would survive but the picture which the student of 1961 have of the world and indeed the picture which our citizen have of the world be infinitely more complicated and infinitely more dangerous
 in 1961 the world relation of this country have become tangle and complex one of our former ally have become our adversary and he have his own adversary who be not our ally hero be remove from their tomb history rewrite the name of city change overnight
 we increase our arm at a heavy cost primarily to make certain that we will not have to use they we must face up to the chance of war if we be to maintain the peace we must work with certain country lack in freedom in order to strengthen the cause of freedom we find some who call themselves neutral who be our friend and sympathetic to we and other who call themselves neutral who be unremittingly hostile to we and as the most powerful defender of freedom on earth we find ourselves unable to escape the responsibility of freedom and yet unable to exercise it without restraint impose by the very freedom we seek to protect
 we can not as a free nation compete with our adversary in tactic of terror assassination false promise counterfeit mob and crisis
 we can not under the scrutiny of a free press and public tell different story to different audience foreign and domestic friendly and hostile
 we can not abandon the slow process of consult with our ally to match the swift expediency of those who merely dictate to their satellite
 we can neither abandon nor control the international organization in which we now cast less than 1 percent of the vote in the general assembly
 we possess weapon of tremendous power but they be least effective in combat the weapon most often use by freedom 's foe subversion infiltration guerrilla warfare civil disorder
 we send arm to other people just as we send they the ideal of democracy in which we believe but we can not send they the will to use those arm or to abide by those ideal
 and while we believe not only in the force of arm but in the force of right and reason we have learn that reason do not always appeal to unreasonable man that it be not always true that a soft answer turneth away wrath"—and that right do not always make might
 in short we must face problem which do not lend themselves to easy or quick or permanent solution and we must face the fact that the united states be neither omnipotent or omniscient that we be only 6 percent of the world 's population that we can not impose our will upon the other 94 percent of mankind that we can not right every wrong or reverse each adversity and that therefore there can not be an american solution to every world problem
 these burden and frustration be accept by most americans with maturity and understanding they may long for the day when war mean charge up san juan hill or when our isolation be guard by two ocean or when the atomic bomb be our alone or when much of the industrialize world depend upon our resource and our aid but they now know that those day be go and that go with they be the old policy and the old complacency 's and they know too that we must make the good of our new problem and our new opportunity whatever the risk and the cost
 but there be other who can not bear the burden of a long twilight struggle they lack confidence in our long run capacity to survive and succeed hate communism yet they see communism in the long run perhaps as the wave of the future and they want some quick and easy and final and cheap solution now
 there be two group of these frustrated citizen far apart in their view yet very much alike in their approach on the one hand be those who urge upon we what i regard to be the pathway of surrender appease our enemy compromise our commitment purchase peace at any price disavow our arm our friend our obligation if their view have prevail the world of free choice would be small today
 on the other hand be those who urge upon we what i regard to be the pathway of war equate negotiation with appeasement and substitute rigidity for firmness if their view have prevail we would be at war today and in more than one place
 it be a curious fact that each of these extreme opposite resemble the other each believe that we have only two choice appeasement or war suicide or surrender humiliation or holocaust to be either red or dead each side see only hard and soft nation hard and soft policy hard and soft man each believe that any departure from its own course inevitably lead to the other one group believe that any peaceful solution mean appeasement the other believe that any arm build up mean war one group regard everyone else as warmonger the other regard everyone else as appeaser neither side admit that its path will lead to disaster but neither can tell we how or where to draw the line once we descend the slippery slope of appeasement or constant intervention
 in short while both extreme profess to be the true realist of our time neither could be more unrealistic while both claim to be do the nation a service they could do it no great disservice this kind of talk and easy solution to difficult problem if believe could inspire a lack of confidence among our people when they must all above all else be unite in recognize the long and difficult day that lie ahead it could inspire uncertainty among our ally when above all else they must be confident in we and even more dangerously it could if believe inspire doubt among our adversary when they must above all be convince that we will defend our vital interest
 the essential fact that both of these group fail to grasp be that diplomacy and defense be not substitute for one another either alone would fail a willingness to resist force unaccompanie by a willingness to talk could provoke belligerence while a willingness to talk unaccompanie by a willingness to resist force could invite disaster
 but as long as we know what comprise our vital interest and our long range goal we have nothing to fear from negotiation at the appropriate time and nothing to gain by refuse to take part in they at a time when a single clash could escalate overnight into a holocaust of mushroom cloud a great power do not prove its firmness by leave the task of explore the other 's intention to sentry or those without full responsibility nor can ultimate weapon rightfully be employ or the ultimate sacrifice rightfully demand of our citizen until every reasonable solution have be explore how many war winston churchill have write have be avert by patience and persist good will how many war have be precipitate by firebrand
 if vital interest under duress can be preserve by peaceful mean negotiation will find that out if our adversary will accept nothing less than a concession of our right negotiation will find that out and if negotiation be to take place this nation can not abdicate to its adversary the task of choose the forum and the framework and the time
 for there be carefully define limit within which any serious negotiation must take place with respect to any future talk on germany and berlin for example we can not on the one hand confine our proposal to a list of concession we be willing to make nor can we on the other hand advance any proposal which compromise the security of free germans and west berliners or endanger their tie with the west
 no one should be under the illusion that negotiation for the sake of negotiation always advance the cause of peace if for lack of preparation they break up in bitterness the prospect of peace have be endanger if they be make a forum for propaganda or a cover for aggression the process of peace have be abuse
 but it be a test of our national maturity to accept the fact that negotiation be not a contest spelling victory or defeat they may succeed they may fail they be likely to be successful only if both side reach an agreement which both regard as preferable to the status quo an agreement in which each side can consider its own situation to be improve and this be most difficult to obtain
 but while we shall negotiate freely we shall not negotiate freedom our answer to the classic question of patrick henry be still no life be not so dear and peace be not so precious as to be purchase at the price of chain and slavery and that be our answer even though for the first time since the ancient battle between greek city state war entail the threat of total annihilation of everything we know of society itself for to save mankind 's future freedom we must face up to any risk that be necessary we will always seek peace but we will never surrender
 in short we be neither warmonger nor appeaser neither hard nor soft we be americans determine to defend the frontier of freedom by an honorable peace if peace be possible but by arm if arm be use against we
 and if we be to move forward in that spirit we shall need all the calm and thoughtful citizen that this great university can produce all the light they can shed all the wisdom they can bring to bear it be customary both here and around the world to regard life in the united states as easy our advantage be many but more than any other people on earth we bear burden and accept risk unprecedented in their size and their duration not for ourselves alone but for all who wish to be free no other generation of free man in any country have ever face so many and such difficult challenge not even those who live in the day when this university be found in 1861
 this nation be then tear by war this territory have only the simple element of civilization and this city have barely begin to function but a university be one of their early thought and they sum it up in the motto that they adopt let there be light what more can be say today regard all the dark and tangle problem we face than let there be light and to accomplish that illumination the university of washington shall still hold high the torch

mr. president and gentleman

 i understand that president mckinley and i be the only two president of the united states to ever address such an occasion i suppose that president mckinley and i be the only two that be regard as fiscally sound enough to be qualified for admission to this organization on an occasion such as this

 i have not always consider the membership of the nam as among my strong supporter i be not sure you have all approach the new frontier with the great possible enthusiasm and i be therefore somewhat nervous about accept this invitation until i do some study of the history of this organization i learn that this organization have once denounce on one occasion i'll quote--"swollen bureaucracy as among the triumph of karl marx and decry on another occasion new governmental paternalism and socialism i be comfort when read this very familiar language to note that i be in very good company for the first attack i quote be on calvin coolidge and the second on herbert hoover

 i remind you of this only to indicate the happy failure of many of our most pessimistic prediction and that be true of all of we i recognize that in the last campaign most of the member of this luncheon group today support my opponent except for a very few who be under the impression that i be my father 's son but i hope that some of your most alarming feeling of a year ago about the imminent collapse of the whole business system if i be elect have be somewhat lessened

 we have select i think able man who i hope you have come to have a regard for to serve in the responsible position of the government one of they here our distinguished secretary of commerce governor hodges who have a long career in business secretary goldberg who i think have earn the respect of business as well as labor secretary of the treasury dillon and his under secretary mr. robert roosa who be the vice president of the federal reserve bank of new york mr. robert mcnamara whom many of you know the secretary of defense mr. john mccone who be the head of the central intelligence agency succeed mr. dulles and mr. rusk secretary of state i think they be all man of experience and also i think they be vitally interested in the maintenance of all kind of freedom in this country

 i think that while we may not have be together a year ago we be together now and i will be the president of the united states for the next three year and i be most anxious that while we may not agree on all matter that goodwill at least will prevail among we and that we will both recognize that those of we who work in the national government and all of you be motivate by a desire to serve our country

 our responsibility be different but i believe that we can have a period in the next few year of cooperation between business and government in order to advance the common interest

 i have read about the feeling of some businessman that we be anti business and i would think that a moment 's thought would show how really untrue that must be and i say it really for three reason

 in the first place we be commit to the defense of freedom around the world when business do well in this country we have full employment and this country be move ahead then it strengthen our image as a prosperous and vital country in this great fight in which we be engaged when you do well the united states do well and our policy abroad do well and when you do badly all suffer

 secondly we be unable to maintain the kind of high employment which we must maintain unless you be make profit and reinveste and produce and therefore as we be commit to the goal and we must all be in this country of try to make sure that everyone who want a job will find it then quite obviously we must make the system work and the business community must prosper

 and thirdly and to put it on its most narrow basis we be in the national government and i know a rather unpopular partner in every one of your business our revenue come from you when you be make profit then we be able to meet our bill when you fail then we fail so for every reason government and business be completely interdependent and completely involve and while we may differ on the policy which may bring this country prosperity there be no disagreement i be sure on either side about the tremendous importance of you gentleman move ahead and prospering and contribute to the growth of this country

 and i hope if nothing else that my presence here today indicate that my remark represent the view of all of we who occupy a position of responsibility in washington today

 it be not an exaggeration to say that this endeavor of build a prosperous america in a world of free and prosperous state of make the most of our human and material resource and avoid the harmful effect and fluctuation of inflation and recession be of course matter of the great importance to we all

 and it be not an exaggeration to say that this endeavor proceed under condition today more fraught with peril than any in our history

 as communism continue its long range drive to impose its way of life all around the world our strong desire be not unnaturally to seize the initiative to get off the defensive to do more than react to the soviets but while this be not an unreasonable urge its concrete application be more difficult in the military arena the initiative rest with the aggressor a role that we shun by nature and tradition and our alliance be largely therefore defensive in the paramilitary arena of subversion intimidation and insurrection an open and peaceful society be again at a disadvantage

 but there be one area in particular where the initiative can and have be ours an area of strategic importance in which we have the capacity for a still great effort and that be in the area of economic policy

 the marshall plan be an example of our initiative in this area so be point 4 and oecd and the alliance for progress this year 's new long range program to aid in the growth of the underdeveloped region of the world and the unaligned nation can bring we still further gain not merely as a blow against communism but as a blow for freedom of equal if not great importance be the stunning evolution of western european economic unity from treaty to concrete reality and it be the success of this still grow movement which present the west at this time with an historic opportunity to seize the initiative again the united states be in fact require to do so for its own self interest and progress

 the communist bloc largely self contain and isolate represent an economic power already by some standard large than that of western europe and gain to some degree on the united states but the combine output and purchasing power of the united states and western europe be more than twice as great as that of the entire sino soviet bloc though we have only half as much population and far less than half as much territory our coordinated economic strength will represent a powerful force for the maintenance and growth of freedom

 but will our strength be combine and coordinate or divided and self defeating will we work together on problem of trade payment and monetary reserve or will our mutual strength be splinter by a network of tariff wall exchange control and the pursuit of narrow self interest in unrelated if not outright hostile policy on aid trade procurement interest rate and currency

 this be not a debate between deficit nation and surplus nation it be not speculation over some grand design for the future it be a hard practical question for every member of the western community involve most immediately for this nation our policy in two mutually dependent area our balance of payment and our balance of trade

 while exaggerated fear can be harmful we would not inspire needed confidence abroad by reign satisfaction with our international balance of payment position in essence that position reflect the burden of our responsibility as the free world 's leader the chief defender of freedom and the major source of capital investment around the world as the cost of these responsibility grow and be not offset by foreign expenditure here the monetary deficit in our relation with the rest of the world grow except to the extent that our trade surplus of export over import can increase with it during the previous three year as competition in international market increase in spite of the fact that we have a generous balance in our favor in trade our trade surplus do not keep pace with our need at the same time high interest rate in other country as well as speculation in the price of gold attract some american short term capital away from our shore our balance of payment be in deficit at a rate of nearly 4 billion dollar a year and with its consequence extend by a weakened confidence in the dollar we suffer over that 3 year period a net loss of 5 billion dollar in our gold reserve

 the complete elimination of this problem be clearly some time off but so be any ultimately dangerous consequence the united states still hold some 43 of the free world 's monetary gold stock a proportion far large than our share of its trade and clearly sufficient to tide we over a temporary deficit period and i emphasize the word temporary deficit period while we mount an offensive to reverse these trend our export and export surplus have both be rise the net claim of americans against foreigner have double during the last decade and the annual increase in the value of our asset abroad which now total nearly 45 billion dollar and must always be put in the balance sheet when we be consider the movement of gold and dollar in the value of our asset abroad have regularly exceed our payment deficit contrary to the assertion that this nation have be live beyond its mean abroad we have be increase those mean instead

 this year moreover our wholesale price have be steady in fact in spite of the recovery our wholesale price be a fraction less than they be in february and in a very real sense for the last three year the united states have have generally stable price confidence in the dollar have be uphold the speculation fever against the dollar have cease the outflow of gold have be reduce from 2 billion dollar in the ten month before february 1961 to 450 million dollar in the last ten month and due partly to the temporary decline in import that accompany the recession our general payment deficit in 1961 will be less than half of the 1960 deficit

 there be cause for concern in short but i do not believe that there be cause for alarm we should be blind neither to our basic strength nor to our basic problem a long term deficit require long term solution and we must not be panic by setback of a short run nature or the inevitable result of a revive economy which have increase our import and therefore leave we in a less favorable position than we might have expect two or three month ago

 for negative shortsighted remedy will do more to weaken confidence in the dollar than strengthen it and this administration therefore during its term of office and i repeat this and make it as a flat statement have no intention of impose exchange control devalue the dollar raise trade barrier or choke off our economic recovery

 what we will do and have be do be to take a series of positive step to reduce our outpayment and to increase our receipt from abroad

 first of all we recognize as already stress that this country can not solve this problem alone our allies have a vital interest in its solution because let i repeat if it be not for our national security commitment abroad which defend our own interest and that of our allies the united states would have gold pour in rather than pour out it be this commitment which be extremely large and constant which give we our problem and should be so recognize our allies therefore have a vital interest in the solution thus we have seek to increase the share of the contribution which other industrialized state be make to the less develop world and be seek their assumption of a large share of the cost of our joint defense requirement

 we lose three billion dollar a year because of our defense expenditure it cost we hundred of million of dollar to keep our troop in western germany we lose nearly three hundred million dollar a year to france alone because of our defense expenditure in those area that three billion dollar therefore represent a charge in the interest of our national security which be vitally important that drain be serious and it be because of that reason that president eisenhower last year suggest the exceptional step of bring back our dependent from western europe which would have save two hundred and fifty million dollar but three billion dollar represent the contribution which we make to our defense establishment abroad

 the reason why the british as you know have be consider withdraw some of their troop from basis station around the world be because of their balance of payment difficulty the reason that they have be reluctant to station additional troop in western germany have be because of the same reason in other word therefore the matter which we be now discuss of trade involve not only our economic wellbeing but the basic commitment of the united states to dozen of country around the world

 unless our balance of trade and our surplus be sufficient for example to pay for this three billion of dollar then we have no remedy but to start pull back so that for those who address themselves to this subject in the come month they must realize that it go to the heart of our survival as well as our economic vitality

 we be work with foreign government now and central bank on new technique for deal in foreign currency on coordinate our development aid fiscal debt management monetary and other policy through the oecd on prepare a new stand by lending authority for the international monetary fund on the prepayment of our allies long term debt during this period of adverse trend and on increase the proportion of their own military procurement in the united states a very important move because of the arrangement that have be recently make that be expect to cut our payment deficit by at least another half a billion dollar next year

 secondly to hold our own outlay abroad to the absolute essential we have emphasize procurement in this country for our military aid and overseas defense and insist upon it for three quarter of our economic aid this mean that our economic aid to these country do not go as far as it once do the south koreans can buy fertilizer from japan at half the cost that they can buy it here in the united states and much less shipping but because we be determined to protect our gold and therefore our dollar we have impose the buy american policy which mean now that our loss because of economic aid abroad our general program which amount to about four billion dollar be now down as far as our dollar loss to five hundred million dollar and we be hopeful that we can squeeze it even down far we have also substitute local currency expenditure for dollar expenditure to cover local cost wherever possible and seek to discourage by a change in the custom law heavy expenditure abroad by tourist to supplement restriction already place on military family i will say i be alarmed to hear the other day of a study in the defense department of this question of dependent abroad which indicate that those who have no dependent abroad spend more money abroad than those with dependent so it indicate that for every solution there be additional problem

 third to encourage a great movement of fund in this direction and to discourage transfer in these other direction we have set up a new program to attract foreign visitor secured passage of a tax exemption encourage foreign central bank to invest their capital in u.s. security keep our own short term interest rate high enough to avoid unnecessary outflow and urge our allies to free their own private capital for investment here at the same time we have direct the treasury for the first time in a generation to buy and sell foreign currency in the international exchange market so as to strengthen its ability to offset unfavorable development affect the value of the dollar

 fourth we have ask the congress and this be a matter which be controversial and to which this group have take exception we have ask the congress to remove the artificial tax preference for american investment in highly develop country with no capital shortage and the unjustifiable tax avoidance loophole available to those americans invest in so call tax haven nation we do not seek to penalize those who wish to invest their capital abroad we be committed to the free flow of capital but we also want to make sure that our tax law do not encourage the outward movement of capital in a way which do not serve our national purpose

 i be aware that many of you will argue that the investment abroad of these fund will mean that ultimately and in the long run these money will be come back but how long a run and how long can we afford without take every responsible step to try to bring this in balance in the short run we can not wait till 1970 if we be lose two or three billion dollar a year and we be now for the first time down to about sixteen billion nine hundred million dollar in gold in the united states

 so that i want to emphasize that however unsatisfactory you may feel it be it be not be do to harass business but only because it represent one additional effort to try to bring the dollar into balance and if we can increase our trade so that our surplus in trade be sufficient to make up these figure then this kind of tax would be unnecessary

 or if this organization have some other plan or program which do not affect our national security which be more equitable we will be glad to listen to that but we be concerned that while capital move freely the tax policy do not stimulate it

 and i emphasize this in say again that i do not believe that exchange control base on the experience of the british and other and our unique role as the banker of the world would be either workable or helpful but the recent flow of our capital to nation already fully develop have be a serious drain in the shortrun on our current balance of payment position the eventual return from that capital be no help to we today and at a time when we be hardpresse to pay for the maintenance of our force in europe without unreasonably increase our payment deficit and our gold outflow i be sure you must realize that it make no sense to be encourage an exodus of capital through tax law that be more appropriate at a time when europe be deficient in capital you probably be familiar with these figure in 1960 the long term outward flow of capital fund be a billion seven hundred million dollar the return be two billion three hundred million dollar and therefore you might argue that we be get more back than we be send out but when those figure be break down we see that the outward investment into the develop country such as western europe be a billion five hundred million dollar and the return be only one billion dollar a loss therefore in dollar and potentially in gold of a half a billion dollar to these country while in the underdeveloped country where we would like to see american capital be invest we take in one billion three hundred million and invest two hundred million dollar

 so that i would say gentleman that all of the proposal which we will have to put forward in the come month and year to try to bring this into balance and i will say that we be go to reduce without weaken our defense our expenditure for military purpose from three billion dollar to two billion dollar we do have to use every available mean that we have and if this organization have suggestion as to how it may be do we want to hear they the good way of course be by increase our export

 fifth and most important of all we be seek to increase our export and thus our surplus of export over import i shall discuss our opportunity but it be worth while recount now that we have embark on a step up campaign of export promotion and trade fair exhibit increase our agricultural export and to indicate the kind of problem that we be go to have we send to western europe in agricultural export nearly two billion dollar which be one of our great dollar earner we take in in agricultural export from europe only about 80 million dollar a balance of trade for we of nearly a billion 920 million dollar and yet as the common market begin to get more and more develop with all of these country begin to face surplus problem there be not any doubt that one of our most important problem in maintain this kind of dollar flow would be to maintain the free flow of our agricultural commodity into the common market there be go to be no more difficult task than that and therefore we have to recognize that this too may affect our balance of payment

 we have broaden the export import bank 's loan guarantee system create a new program of export credit insurance and in a variety of way seek to help you to keep american price competitive this require if we be to avoid the inflation that will price our good out of the world market price and wage restraint by both industry and labor and responsible budget policy by the government it require if we be to offer modern product efficiently produce at a low cost a high rate of investment in new equipment encourage by the full use of exist capacity in a strong recovery by the investment tax credit now pende before the house ways and means committee and by the depreciation reform now under study and already put into effect on textile machinery

 this organization have take a position against our tax credit and the reason be that you do not feel it be sufficient and you support a much more general overhaul of our depreciation i support that too but our tax credit will cost a billion 800 million in our revenue we have suggest and i know this have be unpopular certain taxis to make up that revenue because quite obviously we can not carry out a tax reduction in these critical time without budget problem as difficult as they be therefore while we would like under ideal condition and have hope for example to have a surplus this year before our additional expenditure for defense in july it be very difficult for we to send up a broad tax depreciation scheme which might cost three billion dollar with the expectation that other tax reduction would be add to it at a time when we balance our budget with the great difficulty

 so that we be not unsympathetic and i can think of very few tax change that would be more useful to the country in stimulate employment and keep we competitive particularly with western europe and the only reason we have not go far in it and the only reason we have limit ourselves to the proposal which be now before the house ways and means committee be because we do not have the available revenue to provide for a tax reduction this year

 so that i be hopeful in make your position know to the congress this year that while you will continue to commit yourself to depreciation change and as i say we have make some progress in textile you will also recognize what our budgetary problem be and work with we in attempt to get the good arrangement we can at this time and plan for more satisfactory arrangement in the future

 in short achieve a healthy equilibrium in our international account depend in part upon the cooperation of our allies in part upon action by the congress in part upon the self discipline exercise by this administration in its executive and budgetary policy and here i repeat my intention to submit a balanced budget in january)--and in part upon you and other member of the business community labor too have its responsibility for price stability and i shall stress this tomorrow in address the aflcio i recognize that your effort will be govern in part by the kind of atmosphere the government can help to create that be why we intend to submit our balanced budget the government must not be demand more from the saving of the country nor drain more from the available supply of credit when the national interest demand a priority for productive creative investment not only to spur our growth at home but to make sure that we can sell and sell effectively in market abroad

 but your own responsibility be great and there be three thing in particular that you can do be competitive through low cost and price and well product and productivity be export minded in a very real sense the british use to say they export or die we be go to meet our commitment we have get to export and we have to increase our export and however impressive it have be in the past it must be well in the future for the security of this country

 and finally be calm in the sense of refrain from talk which really do not represent the fact and which cause a concern about where we be go abroad it be my hope that when we submit our balanced budget in january that those who look at our fiscal situation from abroad and make their judgment will recognize that we be in control that we be move ahead and that the united states be a good bet

 all of we must share in this effort for this in part as i have say be a part of the national security and i do not want the united states pull troop home because we be unable to meet our problem in other way

 but we can be calm because our basic international position be strong this year 's deficit will be low than last year's our gold store be large and the outflow be ease we be go to make progress next year in diminish it still far we will submit a balanced budget we be not undergo a damaging inflation we can over the next few year offset with the help of our allies a billion dollar as i have say of our $ 3 billion overseas defense outlay reduce with the help of the congress the money which go because of tax advantage cut back still far that portion of our foreign aid procurement which be not already spend here and take the other step i have mention include an increase in our export for which all the additional tool we need be well within our reach

 one of those tool one which we urgently need for our own well being be a new trade and tariff policy the reciprocal trade agreements act expire in june of next year it must not simply be renew it must be replace if the west be to take the initiative in the economic arena if the united states be to keep pace with the revolutionary change which be take place throughout the world if our export be to retain and expand their position in the world market then we need a new and bold instrument of american trade policy

 for the world of trade be no long the same some 90 of the free world 's industrial production may soon be concentrate in two great market the united states of america and an expand european common market our own example of 50 states without a trade barrier behind a common external tariff help to inspire the common market our support ever since the close of world war ii have be throw behind great european unity for we recognize long ago that such unity would produce a europe in which the ancient rivalry which result in two world war for we as well as for they could rest in peace a europe in which the strength and the destiny of germany would be inextricably tie with the west and a europe no long dependent upon we but on the contrary strong enough to share in full partnership with we the responsibility and initiative of the free world

 now this new house of europe that we seek so long under different administration be actually rise and it mean vast new change in our outlook as well with the accession of the united kingdom and other european nation to the common market they will have almost twice as many people as we do it will cover nation whose economy have be grow twice as fast as ours and it will represent an area with a purchasing power which some day will rival our own it could be it should be our most reliable and profitable customer its consumer demand be grow particularly for the type of good that we produce good for american good not previously sell and sometimes not even know in european market today it be an historic meeting of need and opportunity at the very time that we urgently need to increase our export to protect our balance of payment and to pay for our troop abroad a vast new market be rise across the atlantic

 if however the united states be to enjoy this opportunity it must have the mean to persuade the common market to reduce external tariff to a level which permit our product to enter on a truly competitive basis

 that be why a trade policy adequate to deal with a large number of small state be no long adequate for almost thirty year the reciprocal trade agreements act have strengthen our foreign trade policy but today the approach and procedure provide for in that act be totally irrelevant to the problem and opportunity that we confront its vitality be go a fresh approach be essential and the long we postpone its replacement the more painful that step will be when it finally happen

 for this be no long a matter of local economic interest but of high national policy we can no long haggle over item by item reduction with our principal trading partner but must adjust our trading tool to keep pace with world trading pattern and the eec can not bargain effectively on an item by item basis

 i be propose in short a new american trade initiative which will make it possible for the economic potential of these two great market to be harness together in a team capable of pull the full weight of our common military economic and political aspiration and i do not underrate at all the difficulty that we will have in develop this initiative i be not propose nor be it either necessary or desirable that we join the common market alter our concept of political sovereignty establish a rich man 's trading community abandon our traditional most favor nation policy create an atlantic free trade area or impair in any way our close economic tie with canada japan and the rest of the free world and this of course be a problem of the great importance to we also we do not want japan leave out of this great market or latin america which have depend so much on the european market it may find it now increasingly difficult because of competition from africa to sell in europe which could mean serious trouble for they and therefore for we in the long run both political as well as economic

 i be not propose nor be it either necessary or desirable that in set new policy on import we do away altogether with our traditional safeguard and institution believe we can provide more meaningful concept of injury and relief and far speedy proceeding we can use tariff to cushion adjustment instead of use they only to shut off competition and the federal government can aid that process of adjustment through a program i shall discuss far tomorrow not a welfare program or a permanent subsidy but a means of permit the traditional american force of adaptability and initiative to substitute progress for injury

 for obviously our import will also increase not as much as our export but they will increase and we need those import if other nation be to have the money to buy our export and the incentive to lower their own tariff barrier because nobody be go to lower their barrier unless the united states make a bargain with they which they feel to be in their own economic interest we need those import to give our consumer a wide choice of good at competitive price we need those import to give our industry and defense establishment the raw material they require at price they can afford and to keep a healthy pressure on our own producer and worker to improve efficiency develop well product and avoid the inflation that could price we out of market vital to our own prosperity

 finally let i make it clear that i be not propose a unilateral lowering of our trade barrier what i be propose be a joint step on both side of the atlantic aim at benefit not only the exporter of the country concern but the economy of all of the country of the free world lead by the two great common markets of the atlantic trade barrier in all the industrial nation must be bring down surely it will be say that the bold vision which produce the eec will fall short if it merely transfer european protectionism from the national to the continental level

 but if we can obtain from the congress and successfully use in negotiation sufficient bargaining power to lower common market restriction against our good every segment of the american economy will benefit there be relatively few member of the business community who do not or could not transport distribute or process either export or import there be million of american worker whose job depend on the sale of our good abroad make industrial sewing machine or truck or aircraft part or chemical or equipment for oil field or mining or construction they may produce lubricant or resin they may dig coal or plant cotton in fact the average american farmer today depend on foreign market to sell the crop grow on one out of every six acre he plant in wheat cotton rice and tobacco to name but a few example our consumer as mention will benefit most of all

 but if american industry can not increase its sale to the common market and increase this nation 's surplus of export over import our international payment position and our commitment to the defense of freedom will be endanger

 if american businessman can not increase or even maintain their export to the common market they will surely step up their investment in new american own plant behind those tariff wall so they can compete on an equal basis thereby take capital away from we as well as job from our own shore and worsen still far our balance of payment position

 if american industry can not increase its outlet in the common market our own expansion will be stifle the growth target of 50 in the sixty adopt last month by the 20 nation of oecd for their combine gross national product will not be reach and our business community will lack the incentive to lower price and improve technology which great competition would otherwise inspire the industry which would benefit the most from increase trade be our most efficient even though in many case they pay our high wage their good can compete with the good of any other nation those who would benefit the least and be unwilling to adjust to competition be stand in the way as the nam economic advisory committee point out last year of great growth and a high standard of living they be endanger the profit and job of other our effort against inflation our balance of payment position and in the long run their own economic wellbeing because they will suffer from competition in the u.s. inevitably if not from abroad for in order to avoid exertion they accept paralysis

 finally let i add if we can not increase our sale abroad we will diminish our stature in the free world economic isolation and political leadership be wholly incompatible the united kingdom face with even more serious problem in her effort to achieve both high growth and reasonable balance of payment be move with boldness welcome in the prime minister 's word the brisk shower of competition we can not do less for if the nation of the west can weld together on these problem a common program of action as extraordinary in economic history as nato be unprecedented in military history the long range communist aim of divide and encircle we all be doom to failure

 in every sense of the word therefore capitalism be on trial as we debate these issue for many year in many land we have boast of the virtue of the marketplace under free competitive enterprise of america 's ability to compete and sell of the vitality of our system in keep abreast with the time now the world will see whether we mean it or not whether america will remain the foremost economic power in the world or whether we will evacuate the field of power before a shot be fire or go forth to meet new risk and test of our ability

 the hour of decision have arrive we can not afford to wait and see what happen while the tide of event sweep over and beyond we we must use time as a tool not as a couch we must carve out our own destiny this be what americans have always do and this i have every confidence be what we will continue to do in each new trial and opportunity that lie ahead

mr. meany reverend clergy governor bryant gentleman lady

 it be warm here today than it be yesterday

 i want to express my pleasure at this invitation as one whose work and continuity of employment have depend in part upon the union movement i want to say that i have be on the job training for about 11 month and feel that i have some seniority right in the matter

 i be delighted to be here with you and with secretary of labor arthur goldberg i be up in new york stress physical fitness and in line with that arthur go over with a group to switzerland to climb some of the mountain there they all get up about 5 and he be in bed get up to join they later and when they all come back at 4 o'clock in the afternoon he do not come back with they they send out search party and there be no sign of he that afternoon or night next day the red cross go out and they go around call goldberg goldberg it be the red cross and this voice come down the mountain i give at the office

 those be the liberty you can take with member of the cabinet but i want to say it be a pleasure to be here this be an important anniversary for all of we the 20th anniversary of pearl harbor

 i suppose really the only two date that most people remember where they be be pearl harbor and the death of president franklin roosevelt we face entirely different challenge on this pearl harbor in many way the challenge be more serious and in a sense long reach because i do not think that any of we have any doubt in those day that the united states would survive and prevail and our strength increase

 now we be face to face in a most critical time with challenge all around the world and you in the labor movement bear a heavy responsibility occasionally i read article by those who say that the labor movement have fall into dark day i do not believe that and i would be very distressed if it be true

 one of the great quality about the united states which i do not think people realize who be not in the labor movement be what a great asset for freedom the american labor movement represent not only here but all around the world it be no accident that communist concentrate their attention on the trade union movement they know that people the work people be frequently leave out that in many area of the world they have no one to speak for they and the communists mislead they and say that they will protect their right so many go along

 but in the united states because we have have a strong free labor movement the work people of this country have not feel that they be leave out and as long as the labor movement be strong and as long as it be commit to freedom then i think that freedom in this country be strengthen so i would hope that every american whether he be on one side of the bargaining table or the other or whether he be in a wholly different sphere of life would recognize that the strength of a free american labor movement be vital to the maintenance of freedom in this country and all around the world

 and i be delighted that there be here today i understand nearly 150 trade union leader from nearly 32 country around the world i believe and i say this as president that one of the great asset that this country have be the influence which this labor movement can promote around the world in demonstrate what a free trade union can do

 i hope that they will go back from this meeting recognize that in the long run a strong labor movement be essential to the maintenance of democracy in their country it be no accident that there have not be a strike in the soviet union for 30 or 35 or 40 year the communists who in latin america or africa or asia say that they represent the people can not possibly under any rule of reason or debate say that a labor movement be free when it be not able to express its right not only in relationship to the employer but also to speak out and recognize the limitation of governmental power we be not omniscient we be not all powerful this be a free society and management and labor and the farmer and the citizen have their right we do not give they their right in government and i hope that those who go from this hall to latin america to europe to africa will recognize that we believe in freedom and in progress in this country that we believe that freedom be not an end in itself but we believe that freedom can bring material abundance and prosperity and i want you to know that i consider this meeting and the house of labor vital to the interest of this country and the cause of freedom in the come day

 what unite labor what unite this country be far more important than those thing on which we may disagree so gentleman and lady you be not only leader of your union but you occupy a .position of responsibility as citizen of the united states and therefore i feel it most appropriate to come here today and talk with you

 first i want to express my appreciation to you for several thing for example i appreciate the effort that those of you who represent the interest of the man and woman who work at our missile plant have make the fact that you have give and that the man and woman who work there have live up to the no strike pledge at our missile and space site have make an appreciable difference in the progress that we be make in these area and the country appreciate the effort you be make

 secondly we have for the first time a presidential advisory committee on labor management policy which for once do not break up on the passage of the wagner act in 1935 but instead meet month by month in an attempt to work out and develop economic policy which will permit this country to go forward under condition of full employment and i want to thank you for the participation you have give that

 third as i say i want to thank the labor movement for what it be do abroad in strengthen the free labor movement and i urge you to redouble your effort the hope as i have say of freedom in these country rest in many part with the labor movement we do not want to leave the people of some country a choice between place their destiny in the hand of a few who hold in their hand most of the property and on the other side the communist movement we do not give they that choice we want they to have the instrument of freedom to protect themselves and provide for progress in their country and a strong free labor movement can do it and i hope you will concentrate your attention in the next 12 month in that area in latin america and all around the world

 the fact be that the head of the congo adoula who have be a strong figure for freedom come out of the labor movement and that be happen in country after country and this be a great opportunity and responsibility for all of we to continue to work together

 and finally i want to take this opportunity to express my thank to the aflcio for the support that it give in the passage of our legislative program in the long session of the congress we do not always agree on every tactic we may not have achieve every goal but we can take some satisfaction in the fact that we do make progress toward a $ 1.25 minimum wage that we do expand the coverage for the first time in 20 year that we do pass the good housing act since 1949 that we do finally after two presidential veto in the last 4 year pass a bill provide assistance to those area suffer from chronic unemployment that we do pass a long range water pollution bill that we do pass increase social security benefit a lowering of the retirement age in social security from 65 to 62 for man temporary unemployment compensation and aid to dependent child

 and we be come back in january and we be go to start again

 the gross national product have climb since january from $ 500 billion to an estimate $ 540 billion in the last quarter and it be a pleasure for i to say that the november employment figure receive this morning show not only two million more people than be work in february but we have now an all time high for november 67,349,000 people work but more importantly unlike the usual seasonal run in november which ordinarily provide for an increase in unemployment of about a half a million we have now bring the figure for the first time below the 7 percent where it be hover down to 6.1 percent and we be go to have to get it low

 i would not claim we have achieve full .recovery or the permanently high growth rate of which we be capable since the recession of 58 from which we only partially recover and go into the recession of 1960 too many man and woman have be idle for too long a time and our first concern must still be with those unable to get work unemployment compensation must be place on a permanent rational basis of nationwide standard and even more importantly those who be old and retired must be permit under a system of social security to get assistance and relief from the staggering cost of their medical bill

 the time have come in the next session of the congress to face the fact that our eider citizen do need these benefit that their need can not be adequately meet in any other way and that every member of the congress should have the opportunity to go on the record up or down on this question and i believe when it come to the floor as i believe it must they be go to vote it up and through before they adjourn in july or august

 now there be six area that i believe that we need to give our attention to if the manpower budget be to be balance first we must give special attention to the problem of our young people dr. conant 's recent book only highlight a fact which all of you be familiar with and that be the problem of those who drop out of school before they have finish because of hardship in their home inadequate motivation or counseling or whatever it may be and then drift without be able to find a decent job

 and this fall particularly heavily upon the young man and woman who be in our minority group in addition to that 26 million young people will be crowd into the labor market in the next 10 year this can be a tremendous asset because we have many task that require their talent but today there be one million young americans under the age of 25 who be out of school and out of work million of other leave school early destine to fall for life into a pattern of be untraine unskille and frequently unemployed

 it be for this reason that i have ask the congress to pass a youth employment opportunities act to guide these hand so that they can make a life for themselves equally important if our young people be to be well train and skilled labor be go to be need in the next year and if they be to be inspire to finish their study the federal government must meet its responsibility in the field of education i be not satisfied if my particular community have a good school i want to make sure that every child in this country have an adequate opportunity for a good education

 thomas jefferson once say if you expect a country to be ignorant and free you expect what never be and never will be it be not enough that our own home town have a good school we want the united states as a country to be among the well educate in the world and i believe that we must invest in our youth

 secondly we need a program of retrain our unemployed worker all of you who live so close to this problem know what happen when technology change and industry move out and man be leave and i have see it in my own state of massachusetts where textile worker be unemployed unable to find work even with new electronic plant go up all around they we want to make sure that our worker be able to take advantage of the new job that must inevitably come as technology change in the 1960 's and i believe therefore that retraining deserve the attention of this congress in the come day

 and the third group require our attention consist of our minority citizen all of you know the statistic of those who be first discharge and the last to be rehire too often be among those who be member of our minority group we want everyone to have a chance regardless of their race or color to have an opportunity to make a life for themselves and their family to get a decent education so they have a fair chance to compete and then be judge on what be in here and not on what be on the outside and the american labor movement have be identify with this cause and i know that you will be in the future

 and we be make a great effort to make sure that all those who secure federal contract and there be billion of dollar spend each year by the federal government will give fair opportunity to all of our citizen to participate in that work

 fourth we want to provide opportunity for plant re investment one of the matter which be of concern in maintain our economy now be the fact that we do not have as much re investment in our plant as we do for example in 1955 56 and 57 and we want this economy and this rise to be continuous and i believe we have to give as much incentive as be possible to provide reinvestment in plant which make work and will keep our economy move ahead

 and therefore i have suggest a tax credit which i be hopeful the american labor movement have not place on its list of those matter yet that it have not support but it will consider this proposal as a method of stimulate the economy so that this recovery do not run out of gas in 12 month or 18 month from now as the 1958 59 recovery after the recession of 1958 run out in

 fifth to add to our arsenal of build in stabilizer so we can keep our economy move ahead it be my intention to ask the congress at its next session for stand by authority somewhat along the line of the bill introduce by senator clark of pennsylvania to make grant in aid to community for needed public work when our unemployment begin to mount and our economy to slow down

 sixth and finally we must expand our job opportunity by stimulate our trade abroad i know that this be a matter to which the labor movement have give a good deal of attention mr. meany make an outstanding speech on this matter several week ago and it be a matter which be of concern to this administration i be sure you wonder perhaps why we be place so much emphasis on it and i would like to say why we be very briefly

 the first be this country must maintain a favorable balance of trade or suffer severely from the point of view of our national security we sell abroad now nearly $ 5 billion more than we import but unfortunately that $ 5 billion go abroad in order to maintain the national security requirement of the united states

 we spend $ 3 billion of that in order to keep our troop overseas it cost we nearly $ 700 to $ 800 million to keep our division in western germany and $ 300 million to keep our troop establishment in france and what be true in france and germany which be outpost of our commitment be true in other area

 so that if we be not able to maintain a favorable balance of trade then of course we will have to do as the british have have to do which be begin to bring our troop back and lie the way open for other action so that this be a matter which involve very greatly our security and unless you believe that the united states should retreat to our own hemisphere and forget our commitment abroad then you can share with i my concern about what will happen if that balance of trade begin to drop

 now the problem that we face have be intensify by the development of the common market this be our good market for manufactured product what i be concerned about be that we shall be able to keep move our trade into those area otherwise what we will find be that american capital which can not place its good in that market will decide as they be do now to build their plant in western europe and then they hire western european worker and you suffer and the country suffer and the balance of payment suffer

 so this be a matter of the great importance to you in fact to all americans it be for example of the great importance to american farmer they sell $ 2 billion of agricultural commodity to western europe we bring in $ 80 million of agricultural commodity from western europe in other word we make almost $ 2 billion of our foreign exchange from that sale of agricultural commodity and yet western europe have great agricultural resource which be increase and we be go to find it increasingly difficult unless we be able to negotiate from a position of strength with they so this matter be important

 the purpose of this discussion be to increase employment the purpose of this discussion be to strengthen the united states and it be a matter which deserve our most profound attention

 be we go to export our good and our crop or be we go to export our capital that be the question that we be now face

 and i know that those of you who have be concern about this know this to be a major problem last year 1960 we invest abroad $ 1,700 million and we take in from our investment abroad $ 2,300 million which sound like it be a pretty good exchange but if you analyze these figure you will see that we take in from the underdeveloped world which need capital we take in $ 1,300 million and we send out in capital for investment $ 200 million and yet this be the area that need our investment while in western europe we send out $ 1,500 million and take in $ 1 billion so that if this trend should continue and more and more western europe become the object of american investment it affect we all and affect the people who work with you

 we be attempt to repeal those tax privilege which make it particularly attractive for american capital to invest in western europe we pass law in the day of the marshall plan when we want american capital over there and as the result of that there be provision on the tax book which make it good business to go over there

 now we want it all to be fair and we have state we be not put in exchange control which we will not but we recommend in january the passage of a bill which would lessen the tax privilege of invest in western europe and which would have give we $ 250 million in revenue and in balance of payment

 the tax privilege or the attraction should be in the underdeveloped world where we have be take capital out rather than put it in and not in western europe where the capital be sufficient and which do not serve that great national purpose so this be a matter of concern for all of we and it be a matter which we must consider in the come month

 the common market be a tremendous market it have more people than we do its rate of growth be twice our its income be about three fifth of ours and may some day be equal to ours this can be a great asset not only to they but to we a great strength tie western europe the united states and latin america and japan together as a great area of freedom and i think that it represent one of the most hopeful sign since 1945 it be one place where the free world can be on the offensive and i be anxious that the united states play its proper role to protect the interest of our people and to advance the cause of freedom and i ask the careful consideration of the american labor movement in this area

 one of the problem which we have be to recognize that those who have be affect by import have receive no protection at all for a number of year from the united states government when i be a senator in 1954 i introduce legislation to provide assistance to those industry which be hard hit by import i be go to recommend in january a program which i hope the congress will pass which will provide a recognition of the national responsibility in the period of transition for those industry and people who may be adversely affect

 i be optimistic about the future of this country this be a great country with an energetic people and i believe over the long period the people of .this country and of the world really want freedom and wish to solve their own life and their own destiny i be hopeful that we can be associate with that movement i be hopeful that you will continue to meet your responsibility to your people as well as to the country i hope that we can maintain a viable economy here with full employment i be hopeful we can be competitive here and around the world i be hopeful that management and labor will recognize their responsibility to permit we to compete that those of you who be in the area of wage negotiation will recognize the desirability of we maintain as stable price as possible and that the area of productivity and stable price that your negotiation will take adequate calculation and account of this need for we to maintain a balance of trade in our favor in the long run it be in the interest of your own worker

 let i repeat if we can not maintain the balance of trade in our favor which it now be of $ 5 billion and indeed increase it then this country be go to face most serious problem in the last 3 year even though the balance of trade in our favor have be $ 5 billion we have lose $ 5 billion in gold and if this trend should go on year after year then the united states as i have say would have to make adjustment which would be extremely adverse to the cause of freedom around the world

 the solution rest with increase our export trade with remain competitive with our business sell abroad find new market and keep our people work at home and around the world

 and it be a fact that the six country of the common market who face the problem that we now face have have in the last 4 year full employment and an economic growth twice our even a country which face staggering economic problem a decade ago italy have be steadily build its gold balance cut down its unemployment and move ahead twice what we have over the last 4 year

 so what i be talk about be an opportunity not a burden this be a chance to move the united states forward in the 1960 's not only in the economic sphere but also to make a contribution to the cause of freedom

 and i come to miami today and ask your help as on other occasion other president of the united states stretch back to the time of woodrow wilson and roosevelt and truman have come to the af of l and the cio and each time this organization have say yes
 thank you

lady i want to express my great satisfaction in welcome you to the white house and also as a citizen not merely of the united states but also as an inhabitant of the globe in difficult time i want to express my appreciation to you and the appreciation of the people of this country for your effort in the united nations

 i be present in 1945 at san francisco as a member of the press at the time that the united nations be bear i know that at different time in the last 15 or 16 year this organization have come under criticism in many country i be sure all of your and my own here in the united states

 but recall what robert frost one of our poet once say do not take down the fence until you know why it be put up i have a strong conviction that we should seek to strengthen the united nations and make it the kind of instrument which all of we hope it will be

 i do not think really in any sense the united nations have fail as a concept i think occasionally we fail it and the more that we can do to strengthen the idea of a community of the world to seek to develop manner by which the tension of the world and the problem of the world can be solve in an orderly and peaceful way i think that be in the common interest of all

 the united nations have survive 16 difficult year country once unknown have come into existence and be play important part in the united nations it have come to the present day and play a most important part in the life of all of we

 so i congratulate you for the work that you have do we want you to know that you be very welcome to this country we be glad that you be see something however much we all admire new york we be glad you be see something of the united states besides new york and we hope that while you be visit here you will come not only to washington and new york which in a sense be rather special part of this country but also go perhaps even to boston and even far west
 i want to thank you very much indeed

 i want to say that i have not expect that the standard of revolt would be raise in the royal pavilion here but i be always rather nervous about how you talk about woman who be active in politic whether they want to be talk about as woman or as politician but i want you to know that we be grateful to have you as both today thank you very much

mr. vice president my old colleague from massachusetts and your new speaker john mccormack members of the 87th congress lady and gentleman

 this week we begin anew our joint and separate effort to build the american future but sadly we build without a man who link a long past with the present and look strongly to the future mister sam rayburn be go neither this house nor the nation be the same without he

 member of the congress the constitution make we not rival for power but partner for progress we be all trustee for the american people custodian of the american heritage it be my task to report the state of the union to improve it be the task of we all

 in the past year i have travel not only across our own land but to other land to the north and the south and across the sea and i have find as i be sure you have in your travel that people everywhere in spite of occasional disappointment look to we not to our wealth or power but to the splendor of our ideal for our nation be commission by history to be either an observer of freedom 's failure or the cause of its success our overriding obligation in the month ahead be to fulfill the world 's hope by fulfil our own faith

 that task must begin at home for if we can not fulfill our own ideal here we can not expect other to accept they and when the young child alive today have grow to the care of manhood our position in the world will be determine first of all by what provision we make today for his education his health and his opportunity for a good home and a good job and a good life

 at home we begin the year in the valley of recession we complete it on the high road of recovery and growth with the help of new congressionally approve or administratively increase stimulant to our economy the number of major surplus labor u area have decline from 101 to 60 nonagricultural employment have increase by more than a million job and the average factory work week have rise to well over 40 hour at year 's end the economy which mr. khrushchev once call a stumble horse be race to new record in consumer spending labor income and industrial production

 we be gratify but we be not satisfied too many unemployed be still look for the blessing of prosperity- as those who leave our school and farm demand new job automation take old job away to expand our growth and job opportunity i urge on the congress three measure

 first the manpower training and development act to stop the waste of able bodied man and woman who want to work but whose only skill have be replace by a machine or move with a mill or shut down with a mine

 second the youth employment opportunities act to help train and place not only the one million young americans who be both out of school and out of work but the twenty six million young americans enter the labor market in this decade and

 third the 8 percent tax credit for investment in machinery and equipment which combine with plan revision of depreciation allowance will spur our modernization our growth and our ability to compete abroad

 moreover pleasant as it may be to bask in the warmth of recovery let we not forget that we have suffer three recession in the last 7 year the time to repair the roof be when the sun be shine by fill three basic gap in our anti recession protection we need

 first presidential standby authority subject to congressional veto to adjust personal income tax rate downward within a specified range and time to slow down an economic decline before it have drag we all down

 second presidential standby authority upon a give rise in the rate of unemployment to accelerate federal and federally aid capital improvement program and

 third a permanent strengthening of our unemployment compensation system to maintain for our fellow citizen search for a job who can not find it their purchasing power and their living standard without constant resort as we have see in recent year by the congress and the administration to temporary supplement

 if we enact this six part program we can show the whole world that a free economy need not be an unstable economy that a free system need not leave man unemployed and that a free society be not only the most productive but the most stable form of organization yet fashion by man

 but recession be only one enemy of a free economy inflation be another last year 1961 despite rise production and demand consumer price hold almost steady and wholesale price decline this be the good record of overall price stability of any comparable period of recovery since the end of world war ii

 inflation too often follow in the shadow of growth while price stability be make easy by stagnation or control but we mean to maintain both stability and growth in a climate of freedom

 our first line of defense against inflation be the good sense and public spirit of business and labor keep their total increase in wage and profit in step with productivity there be no single statistical test to guide each company and each union but i strongly urge they for their country 's interest and for their own to apply the test of the public interest to these transaction

 within this same framework of growth and wage price stability

 --this administration have help keep our economy competitive by widen the access of small business to credit and government contract and by step up the drive against monopoly price fixing and racketeering

 --we will submit a federal pay reform bill aim at give our classified postal and other employee new pay scale more comparable to those of private industry

 --we be hold the fiscal 1962 budget deficit far below the level incur after the last recession in 1958 and finally

 --i be submit for fiscal 1963 a balanced federal budget

 this be a joint responsibility require congressional cooperation on appropriation and on three source of income in particular

 first an increase in postal rate to end the postal deficit

 secondly passage of the tax reform previously urge to remove unwarranted tax preference and to apply to dividend and to interest the same withholding requirement we have long apply to wage and

 third extension of the present excise and corporation tax rate except for those change which will be recommend in a message affect transportation

 but a strong nation and economy require more than a balanced budget they require progress in those program that spur our growth and fortify our strength

 a strong america depend on its city america 's glory and sometimes america 's shame to substitute sunlight for congestion and progress for decay we have step up exist urban renewal and housing program and launch new one redouble the attack on water pollution speed aid to airport hospital highway and our decline mass transit system and secure new weapon to combat organized crime racketeering and youth delinquency assist by the coordinated and hard hit effort of our investigative service the fbi the internal revenue the bureau of narcotics and many other we shall need further anti crime mass transit and transportation legislation and new tool to fight air pollution and with all this effort under way both equity and commonsense require that our nation 's urban area contain three fourth of our population sit as equal at the cabinet table i urge a new department of urban affairs and housing

 a strong america also depend on its farm and natural resource american farmer take heart in 1961 -from a billion dollar rise in farm income and from a hopeful start on reduce the farm surplus but we be still operate under a patchwork accumulation of old law which cost we $ 1 billion a year in ccc carry charge alone yet fail to halt rural poverty or boost farm earning

 our task be to master and turn to fully fruitful end the magnificent productivity of our farm and farmer the revolution on our own countryside stand in the sharp contrast to the repeat farm failure of the communist nation and be a source of pride to we all since 1950 our agricultural output per man hour have actually double without new realistic measure it will someday swamp our farmer and our taxpayer in a national scandal or a farm depression

 i will therefore submit to the congress a new comprehensive farm program tailor to fit the use of our land and the supply of each crop to the long range need of the sixty and design to prevent chaos in the sixty with a program of commonsense

 we also need for the sixty if we be to bequeath our full national estate to our heir a new long range conservation and recreation program expansion of our superb national park and forest preservation of our authentic wilderness area new start on water and power project as our population steadily increase and expand rea generation and transmission loan

 but america stand for progress in human right as well as economic affair and a strong america require the assurance of full and equal right to all its citizen of any race or of any color this administration have show as never before how much could be do through the full use of executive power through the enforcement of law already pass by the congress through persuasion negotiation and litigation to secure the constitutional right of all the right to vote the right to travel without hindrance across state line and the right to free public education

 i issue last march a comprehensive order to guarantee the right to equal employment opportunity in all federal agency and contractor the vice president 's committee thus create have do much include the voluntary plan for progress which in all section of the country be achieve a quiet but striking success in opening up to all race new professional supervisory and other job opportunity

 but there be much more to be do by the executive by the court and by the congress among the bill now pende before you on which the executive department will comment in detail be appropriate method of strengthen these basic right which have our full support the right to vote for example should no long be deny through such arbitrary device on a local level sometimes abuse such as literacy test and poll taxis as we approach the 100th anniversary next january of the emancipation proclamation let the act of every branch of the government and every citizen portray that righteousness do exalt a nation

 finally a strong america can not neglect the aspiration of its citizen the welfare of the needy the health care of the elderly the education of the young for we be not develop the nation 's wealth for its own sake wealth be the mean and people arc the end all our material rich will avail we little if we do not use they to expand the opportunity of our people

 last year we improve the diet of needy people provide more hot lunch and fresh milk to school child build more college dormitory and for the elderly expand private housing nursing home heath service and social security but we have just begin

 to help those least fortunate of all i be recommend a new public welfare program stress service instead of support rehabilitation instead of relief and training for useful work instead of prolong dependency

 to relieve the critical shortage of doctor and dentist and this be a matter which should concern we all and expand research i urge action to aid medical and dental college and scholarship and to establish new national institutes of health

 to take advantage of modern vaccination achievement i be propose a mass immunization program aim at the virtual elimination of such ancient enemy of our child as polio diphtheria whooping cough and tetanus

 to protect our consumer from the careless and the unscrupulous i shall recommend improvement in the food and drug law strengthen inspection and standard halt unsafe and worthless product prevent mislead label and crack down on the illicit sale of habit form drug

 but in matter of health no piece of unfinished business be more important or more urgent than the enactment under the social security system of health insurance for the aged

 for our old citizen have long and more frequent illness high hospital and medical bill and too little income to pay they private health insurance help very few for its cost be high and its coverage limit public welfare can not help those too proud to seek relief but hard press to pay their own bill nor can their child or grandchild always sacrifice their own health budget to meet this constant drain

 social security have long help to meet the hardship of retirement death and disability i now urge that its coverage be extend without further delay to provide health insurance for the elderly

 equally important to our strength be the quality of our education eight million adult americans be classify as functionally illiterate this be a disturbing figure reflect in selective service rejection rate reflect in welfare roll and crime rate and i shall recommend plan for a massive attack to end this adult illiteracy

 i shall also recommend bill to improve educational quality to stimulate the art and at the college level to provide federal loan for the construction of academic facility and federally finance scholarship

 if this nation be to grow in wisdom and strength then every able high school graduate should have the opportunity to develop his talent yet nearly half lack either the fund or the facility to attend college enrollment be go to double in our college in the short space of 10 year the annual cost per student be skyrocket to astronomical level now average $ 1,650 a year although almost half of our family earn less than $ 5,000 they can not afford such cost but this nation can not afford to maintain its military power and neglect its brainpower

 but excellence in education must begin at the elementary level i send to the congress last year a proposal for federal aid to public school construction and teacher salary i believe that bill which pass the senate and receive house committee approval offer the minimum amount require by our need and in term of across the board aid the maximum scope permit by our constitution i therefore see no reason to weaken or withdraw that bill and i urge its passage at this session

 civilization say h. g. wells be a race between education and catastrophe it be up to you in this congress to determine the winner of that race

 these be not unrelated measure address to specific gap or grievance in our national life they be the pattern of our intention and the foundation of our hope i believe in democracy say woodrow wilson because it release the energy of every human being the dynamic of democracy be the power and the purpose of the individual and the policy of this administration be to give to the individual the opportunity to realize his own high possibility

 our program be to open to all the opportunity for steady and productive employment to remove from all the handicap of arbitrary or irrational exclusion to offer to all the facility for education and health and welfare to make society the servant of the individual and the individual the source of progress and thus to realize for all the full promise of american life

 all of these effort at home give meaning to our effort abroad since the close of the second world war a global civil war have divide and tormented mankind but it be not our military might or our high standard of living that have most distinguish we from our adversary it be our belief that the state be the servant of the citizen and not his master

 this basic clash of idea and will be but one of the force reshape our globe sweep as it be by the tide of hope and fear by crisis in the headline today that become mere footnote tomorrow both the success and the setback of the past year remain on our agenda of unfinished business for every apparent blessing contain the seed of danger every area of trouble give out a ray of hope and the one unchangeable certainty be that nothing be certain or unchangeable

 yet our basic goal remain the same a peaceful world community of free and independent state free to choose their own future and their own system so long as it do not threaten the freedom of other

 some may choose form and way that we would not choose for ourselves but it be not for we that they be choose we can welcome diversity the communists can not for we offer a world of choice they offer the world of coercion and the way of the past show dearly that freedom not coercion be the wave of the future at time our goal have be obscure by crisis or endanger by conflict but it draw sustenance from five basic source of strength

 --the moral and physical strength of the united states

 --the united strength of the atlantic community

 --the regional strength of our hemispheric relation

 --the creative strength of our effort in the new and develop nation and

 --the peace keep strength of the united nations

 our moral and physical strength begin at home as already discuss but it include our military strength as well so long as fanaticism and fear brood over the affair of man we must arm to deter other from aggression

 in the past 12 month our military posture have steadily improve we increase the previous defense budget by 15 percent not in the expectation of war but for the preservation of peace we more than double our acquisition rate of polaris submarine we double the production capacity for minuteman missile and increase by 50 percent the number of man bomber stand ready on a 15 minute alert this year the combine force level plan under our new defense budget include nearly three hundred additional polaris and minuteman missile have be precisely calculate to insure the continue strength of our nuclear deterrent

 but our strength may be test at many level we intend to have at all time the capacity to resist non nuclear or limited attack as a complement to our nuclear capacity not as a substitute we have reject any all or nothing posture which would leave no choice but inglorious retreat or unlimited retaliation

 thus we have double the number of ready combat division in the army 's strategic reserve increase our troop in europe build up the marines add new sealift and airlift capacity modernize our weapon and ammunition expand our anti guerrilla force and increase the active fleet by more than 70 vessel and our tactical air force by nearly a dozen wing

 because we need to reach this high long term level of readiness more quickly 155,000 member of the reserve and national guard be activate under the act of this congress some disruption and distress be inevitable but the overwhelming majority bear their burden and their nation 's burden with admirable and traditional devotion

 in the come year our reserve program will be revise two army divisions will i hope replace those guard divisions on duty and substantial other increase will boost our air force fighter unit the procurement of equipment and our continental defense and warning effort the nation 's first serious civil defense shelter program be under way identify marking and stock 50 million space and i urge your approval of federal incentive for the construction of public fall out shelter in school and hospital and similar center

 but arm alone be not enough to keep the peace it must be keep by man our instrument and our hope be the united nations and i see little merit in the impatience of those who would abandon this imperfect world instrument because they dislike our imperfect world for the trouble of a world organization merely reflect the trouble of the world itself and if the organization be weaken these trouble can only increase we may not always agree with every detailed action take by every officer of the united nations or with every voting majority but as an institution it should have in the future as it have have in the past since its inception no strong or more faithful member than the united states of america

 in 1961 the peace keep strength of the united nations be reinforce and those who prefer or predict its demise envision a troika in the seat of hammarskiold or red china inside the assembly have see instead a new vigor under a new secretary general and a fully independent secretariat in make plan for a new forum and principle on disarmament for peace keeping in outer space for a decade of development effort the un fulfil its charter 's lofty aim

 eighteen month ago the tangled and turbulent congo present the un with its grave challenge the prospect be one of chaos or certain big power confrontation with all of its hazard and all of its risk to we and to other today the hope have improve for peaceful conciliation within a united congo this be the objective of our policy in this important area

 no policeman be universally popular particularly when he use his stick to restore law and order on his beat those member who be willing to contribute their vote and their view but very little else have create a serious deficit by refuse to pay their share of special un assessment yet they do pay their annual assessment to retain their vote and a new un bond issue finance special operation for the next 18 month be to be repay with interest from these regular assessment this be clearly in our interest it will not only keep the un solvent but require all vote member to pay their fair share of its activity our share of special operation have long be much high than our share of the annual assessment and the bond issue will in effect reduce our disproportionate obligation and for these reason i be urge congress to approve our participation

 with the approval of this congress we have undertake in the past year a great new effort in outer space our aim be not simply to be first on the moon any more than charles lindbergh 's real aim be to be the first to paris his aim be to develop the technique of our own country and other country in the field of air and the atmosphere and our objective in make this effort which we hope will place one of our citizen on the moon be to develop in a new frontier of science commerce and cooperation the position of the united states and the free world

 this nation belong among the first to explore it and among the first if not the first we shall be we be offer our know how and our cooperation to the united nations our satellite will soon be provide other nation with improved weather observation and i shall soon send to the congress a measure to govern the financing and operation of an international communications satellite system in a manner consistent with the public interest and our foreign policy

 but peace in space will help we naught once peace on earth be go world order will be secure only when the whole world have lay down these weapon which seem to offer we present security but threaten the future survival of the human race that armistice day seem very far away the vast resource of this planet be be devote more and more to the mean of destroy instead of enrich human life

 but the world be not mean to be a prison in which man await his execution nor have mankind survive the test and trial of thousand of year to surrender everything include its existence now this nation have the will and the faith to make a supreme effort to break the log jam on disarmament and nuclear test and we will persist until we prevail until the rule of law have replace the ever dangerous use of force

 i turn now to a prospect of great promise our hemispheric relation the alliance for progress be be rapidly transform from proposal to program last month in latin america i see for myself the quickening of hope the revival of confidence the new trust in our country among worker and farmer as well as diplomat we have pledge our help in speed their economic educational and social progress the latin american republics have in turn pledge a new and strenuous effort of self help and self reform

 to support this historic undertaking i be propose under the authority contain in the bill of the last session of the congress a special long term alliance for progress fund of $ 3 billion combine with our food for peace export import bank and other resource this will provide more than $ 1 billion a year in new support for the alliance in addition we have increase twelve fold our spanish and portuguese language broadcasting in latin america .and improve hemispheric trade and defense and while the blight of communism have be increasingly expose and isolate in the americas liberty have score a gain the people of the dominican republic with our firm encouragement and help and those of our sister republics of this hemisphere be safely pass through the treacherous course from dictatorship through disorder towards democracy

 our effort to help other new or develop nation and to strengthen their stand for freedom have also make progress a newly unify agency for international development be reorient our foreign assistance to emphasize long term development loan instead of grant more economic aid instead of military individual plan to meet the individual need of the nation and new standard on what they must do to marshal their own resource

 a newly conceive peace corps be win friend and help people in fourteen country supply train and dedicated young man and woman to give these new nation a hand in build a society and a glimpse of the good that be in our country if there be a problem here it be that we can not supply the spontaneous and mount demand

 a newly expand food for peace pro- gram be feed the hungry of many land with the abundance of our productive farm provide lunch for child in school wage for economic development relief for the victim of flood and famine and a well diet for million whose daily bread be their chief concern

 these program help people and by help people they help freedom the view of their government may sometimes be very different from our but event in africa the middle east and eastern europe teach we never to write off any nation as lose to the communists- that be the lesson of our time we support the independence of those new or weak state whose history geography economy or lack of power impel they to remain outside entangle alliances"--as we do for more than a century for the independence of nation be a bar to the communists grand design"-it be the basis of our own

 in the past year for example we have urge a neutral and independent laos regain there a common policy with our major ally and insist that a cease fire precede negotiation while a workable formula for supervise its independence be still to be achieve both the spread of war which might have involve this country also and a communist occupation have thus far be prevent

 a satisfactory settlement in laos would also help to achieve and safeguard the peace in viet nam where the foe be increase his tactic of terror where our own effort have be step up and where the local government have initiate new program and reform to broaden the base of resistance the systematic aggression now bleed that country be not a war of liberation"--for viet nam be already free it be a war of attempt subjugation and it will be resist

 finally the united strength of the atlantic community have flourish in the last year under severe test nato have increase both the number and the readiness of its air ground and naval unit both its nuclear and non nuclear capability even great effort by all its member be still require nevertheless our unity of purpose and will have be i believe immeasurably strengthen

 the threat to the brave city of berlin remain in these last 6 month the allies have make it unmistakably clear that our presence in berlin our free access thereto and the freedom of two million west berliners would not be surrender either to force or through appeasement and to maintain those right and obligation we be prepared to talk when appropriate and to fight if necessary every member of nato stand with we in a common commitment to preserve this symbol of free man 's will to remain free

 i can not now predict the course of future negotiation over berlin i can only say that we be spare no honorable effort to find a peaceful and mutually acceptable resolution of this problem i believe such a resolution can be find and with it an improvement in our relation with the soviet union if only the leader in the kremlin will recognize the basic right and interest involve and the interest of all mankind in peace

 but the atlantic community be no long concern with purely military aim as its common undertaking grow at an ever increase pace we be and increasingly will be partner in aid trade defense diplomacy and monetary affair

 the emergence of the new europe be be match by the emergence of new tie across the atlantic it be a matter of undramatic daily cooperation in hundred of workaday task of currency keep in effective relation of development loan mesh together of standardized weapon and concert diplomatic position the atlantic community grow not like a volcanic mountain by one mighty explosion but like a coral reef from the accumulate activity of all

 thus we in the free world be move steadily toward unity and cooperation in the tooth of that old bolshevik prophecy and at the very time when extraordinary rumble of discord can be hear across the iron curtain it be not free society which bear within they the seed of inevitable disunity

 on one special problem of great concern to our friend and to we i be proud to give the congress an encouraging report our effort to safeguard the dollar be progress in the 11 month precede last february 1 we suffer a net loss of nearly $ 2 billion in gold in the 11 month that follow the loss be just over half a billion dollar and our deficit in our basic transaction with the rest of the world trade defense foreign aid and capital exclude volatile short term flow have be reduce from $ 2 billion for 1960 to about one third that amount for 1961 speculative fever against the dollar be end and confidence in the dollar have be restore

 we do not and could not achieve these gain through import restriction troop withdrawal exchange control dollar devaluation or choke off domestic recovery we act not in panic but in perspective but the problem be not yet solve persistently large deficit would endanger our economic growth and our military and defense commitment abroad our goal must be a reasonable equilibrium in our balance of payment with the cooperation of the congress business labor and our major ally that goal can be reach

 we shall continue to attract foreign tourist and investment to our shore to seek increase military purchase here by our ally to maximize foreign aid procurement from american firm to urge increase aid from other fortunate nation to the less fortunate to seek tax law which do not favor investment in other industrialized nation or tax haven and to urge coordination of ally fiscal and monetary policy so as to discourage large and disturbing capital movement

 above all if we be to pay for our commitment abroad we must expand our export our businessman must be export conscious and export competitive our tax policy must spur modernization of our plant our wage and price gain must be consistent with productivity to hold the line on price our export credit and promotion campaign for american industry must continue to expand

 but the great challenge of all be pose by the growth of the european common market assume the accession of the united kingdom there will arise across the atlantic a trading partner behind a single external tariff similar to ours with an economy which nearly equal our own will we in this country adapt our thinking to these new prospect and pattern or will we wait until event have pass we by

 this be the year to decide the reciprocal trade act be expire we need a new law a wholly new approach a bold new instrument of american trade policy our decision could well affect the unity of the west the course of the cold war and the economic growth of our nation for a generation to come

 if we move decisively our factory and farm can increase their sale to their rich fast grow market our export will increase our balance of payment position will improve and we will have forge across the atlantic a trading partnership with vast resource for freedom

 if on the other hand we hang back in deference to local economic pressure we will find ourselves cut off from our major ally industry and i believe this be most vital industry will move their plant and job and capital inside the wall of the common market and job therefore will be lose here in the united states if they can not otherwise compete for its consumer our farm surplus our balance of trade as you all know to europe the common market in farm product be nearly three or four to one in our favor amount to one of the good earner of dollar in our balance of payment structure and without entrance to this market without the ability to enter it our farm surplus will pile up in the middle west tobacco in the south and other commodity which have go through western europe for 15 year our balance of payment position will worsen our consumer will lack a wide choice of good at low price and million of american worker whose job depend on the sale or the transportation or the distribution of export or import or whose job will be endanger by the movement of our capital to europe or whose job can be maintain only in an expand economy these million of worker in your home states and mine will see their real interest sacrifice

 member of the congress the united states do not rise to greatness by wait for other to lead this nation be the world 's foremost manufacturer farmer banker consumer and exporter the common market be move ahead at an economic growth rate twice our the communist economic offensive be under way the opportunity be ours the initiative be up to we and i believe that 1962 be the time

 to seize that initiative i shall shortly send to the congress a new five year trade expansion action far reach in scope but design with great care to make certain that its benefit to our people far outweigh any risk the bill will permit the gradual elimination of tariff here in the united states and in the common market on those item in which we together supply 80 percent of the world 's trade mostly item in which our own ability to compete be demonstrate by the fact that we sell abroad in these item substantially more than we import this step will make it possible for our major industry to compete with their counterpart in western europe for access to european consumer

 on other good the bill will permit a gradual reduction of duty up to 50 percent permit bargaining by major category and provide for appropriate and test form of assistance to firm and employee adjust to import competition we be not neglect the safeguard provide by peril point an escape clause or the national security amendment nor be we abandon our non european friend or our traditional most favor nation principle on the contrary the bill will provide new encouragement for their sale of tropical agricultural product so important to our friend in latin america who have long depend upon the european market who now find themselves face with new challenge which we must join with they in overcome

 concessions in this bargaining must of course be reciprocal not unilateral the common market will not fulfill its own high promise unless its outside tariff wall be low the danger of restriction or timidity in our own policy have counterpart for our friend in europe for together we face a common challenge to enlarge the prosperity of free man everywhere to build in partnership a new trading community in which all free nation may gain from the productive energy of free competitive effort

 these various element in our foreign policy lead as i have say to a single goal the goal of a peaceful world of free and independent state this be our guide for the present and our vision for the future a free community of nation independent but interdependent unite north and south east and west in one great family of man outgrow and transcend the hate and fear that rend our age

 we will not reach that goal today or tomorrow we may not reach it in our own lifetime but the quest be the great adventure of our century we sometimes chafe at the burden of our obligation the complexity of our decision the agony of our choice but there be no comfort or security for we in evasion no solution in abdication no relief in irresponsibility

 a year ago in assume the task of the presidency i say that few generation in all history have be grant the role of be the great defender of freedom in its hour of maximum danger this be our good fortune and i welcome it now as i do a year ago for it be the fate of this generation of you in the congress and of i as president to live with a struggle we do not start in a world we do not make but the pressure of life be not always distribute by choice and while no nation have ever face such a challenge no nation have ever be so ready to seize the burden and the glory of freedom

 and in this high endeavor may god watch over the united states of america

 the last time that i come to this stadium be 22 year ago when i visit it in november of 1940 as a student at a nearby small school for the game with stanford and we get a i must say i have a much warm reception today than i do from my coast friend here on that occasion in those day we use to fill these university for football and now we do it for academic event and i be not sure that this do not represent a rather dangerous trend for the future of our country

 i be delighted to be here on this occasion for though it be the 94th anniversary of the charter in a sense this be the hundredth anniversary for this university and so many other university across our country owe their birth to the most extraordinary piece of legislation which this country have ever adopt and that be the morrill act sign by president abraham lincoln in the dark and most uncertain day of the civil war which set before the country the opportunity to build the great land grant college of which this be so distinguish a part six year later this university obtain its charter

 in its first graduating class it include a future governor of california a future congressman a judge a state assemblyman a clergyman a lawyer a doctor all in a graduating class of 12 student

 this college therefore from its early beginning have recognize and its graduate have recognize that the purpose of education be not merely to advance the economic self interest of its graduate the people of california as much if not more than the people of any other state have support their college and their university and their school because they recognize how important it be to the maintenance of a free society that its citizen be well educate

 every man say professor woodrow wilson send out from a university should be a man of his nation as well as a man of his time

 and prince bismarck be even more specific one third he say of the student of german university break down from overwork another third break down from dissipation and the other third rule germany

 i do not know which third of student be here today but i be confident that i be talk to the future leader of this state and country who recognize their responsibility to the public interest

 today you carry on that tradition our distinguished and courageous secretary of defense our distinguished secretary of state the chairman of the atomic energy commission the director of the cia and other all be graduate of this university it be a disturbing fact to i and it may be to some of you that the new frontier owe as much to berkeley as it do to harvard university

 this have be a week of momentous event around the world the long and painful struggle in algeria which come to an end both nuclear power and neutral labor at geneva for a solution to the problem of a spiral arm race and also to the problem that so vex our relation with the soviet union the congress open hearing on a trade bill which be far more than a trade bill but an opportunity to build a strong and close atlantic community and my wife have she first and last ride on an elephant

 but history may well remember this as a week for an act of less immediate impact and that be the decision by the united states and the soviet union to seek concrete agreement on the joint exploration of space experience have teach we that an agreement to negotiate do not always mean a negotiate agreement but should such a joint effort be realize its significance could well be tremendous for we all in term of space science our combined knowledge and effort can benefit the people of all the nation joint weather satellite to provide more ample warning against destructive storm joint communication system to draw the world more closely together and cooperation in space medicine research and space tracking operation to speed the day when man will go to the moon and beyond

 but the scientific gain from such a joint effort would offer i believe less realize return than the gain for world peace for a cooperative soviet american effort in space science and exploration would emphasize the interest that must unite we rather than those that always divide we it offer we an area in which the stale and sterile dogma of the cold war could be literally leave a quarter of a million mile behind and it would remind we on both side that knowledge not hate be the passkey to the future that knowledge transcend national antagonism that it speak a universal language that it be the possession not of a single class or of a single nation or a single ideology but of all mankind

 i need hardly emphasize the happy pursuit of knowledge in this place your faculty include more nobel laureate than any other faculty in the world more in this one community than our principal adversary have receive since the award begin in 1901 and we take pride in that only from a national point of view because it indicate as the chancellor point out the great intellectual benefit of a free society this university of california will continue to grow as an intellectual center because your president and your chancellor and your professor have rigorously defend that unhampere freedom of discussion and inquiry which be the soul of the intellectual enterprise and the heart of a free university

 we may be proud as a nation of our record in scientific achievement but at the same time we must be impress by the interdependence of all knowledge i be certain that every scholar and scientist here today would agree that his own work have benefit immeasurably from the work of the man and woman in other country the prospect of a partnership with soviet scientist in the exploration of space open up exciting prospect of collaboration in other area of learn and cooperation in the pursuit of knowledge can hopefully lead to cooperation in the pursuit of peace

 yet the pursuit of knowledge itself imply a world where man be free to follow out the logic of their own idea it imply a world where nation be free to solve their own problem and to realize their own ideal it imply in short a world where collaboration emerge from the voluntary decision of nation strong in their own independence and their own self respect it imply i believe the kind of world which be emerge before our eye the world produce by the revolution of national independence which have today and have be since 1945 sweep across the face of the world

 i sometimes think that we be too much impressed by the clamor of daily event the newspaper headline and the television screen give we a short view they so flood we with the stop press detail of daily story that we lose sight of one of the great movement of history yet it be the profound tendency of history and not the pass excitement that will shape our future

 the short view give we the impression as a nation of be shove and harry everywhere on the defense but this impression be surely an optical illusion from the perspective of moscow the world today may seem ever more troublesome more intractable more frustrating than it do to we the leader of the communist world be confront not only by acute internal problem in each communist country the failure of agriculture the rise discontent of the youth and the intellectual the demand of technical and managerial group for status and security they be confront in addition by profound division within the communist world itself division which have already shatter the image of communism as a universal system guarantee to abolish all social and international conflict the most valuable asset the communists have for many year

 wisdom require the long view and the long view show we that the revolution of national independence be a fundamental fact of our era this revolution will not be stop as new nation emerge from the oblivion of century their first aspiration be to affirm their national identity their deep hope be for a world where within a framework of international cooperation every country can solve its own problem accord to its own tradition and ideal

 it be in the interest of the pursuit of .knowledge and it be in our own national interest that this revolution of national independence succeed for the communists rest everything on the idea of a monolithic world a world where all knowledge have a single pattern all society move toward a single model and all problem and road have a single solution and a single destination the pursuit of knowledge on the other hand rest everything on the opposite idea on the idea of a world base on diversity self determination freedom and that be the kind of world to which we americans as a nation be commit by the principle upon which the great republic be found

 as man conduct the pursuit of knowledge they create a world which freely unite national diversity and international partnership this emerge world be incompatible with the communist world order it will irresistibly burst the bond of the communist organization and the communist ideology and diversity and independence far from be oppose to the american conception of world order represent the very essence of our view of the future of the world

 there use to be so much talk a few year ago about the inevitable triumph of communism we hear such talk much less now no one who examine the modern world can doubt that the great current of history be carry the world away from the monolithic idea towards the pluralistic idea away from communism and towards national independence and freedom no one can doubt that the wave of the future be not the conquest of the world by a single dogmatic creed but the liberation of the diverse energy of free nation and free man no one can doubt that cooperation in the pursuit of knowledge must lead to freedom of the mind and freedom of the soul

 beyond the drumfire of daily crisis therefore there be arise the outline of a robust and vital world community found on nation secure in their own independence and unite by allegiance to world peace it would be foolish to say that this world will be win tomorrow or the day after the process of history be fitful and uncertain and aggravating there will be frustration and setback there will be time of anxiety and gloom the specter of thermonuclear war will continue to hang over mankind and we must heed the advice of oliver wendell holmes of freedom lean on her spear until all nation be wise enough to disarm safely and effectively

 yet we can have a new confidence today in the direction in which history be move nothing be more stirring than the recognition of great public purpose every great age be mark by innovation and daring by the ability to meet unprecedented problem with intelligent solution in a time of turbulence and change it be more true than ever that knowledge be power for only by true understanding and steadfast judgment be we able to master the challenge of history

 if this be so we must strive to acquire knowledge and to apply it with wisdom we must reject over simplify theory of international life the theory that american power be unlimited or that the american mission be to remake the world in the american image we must seize the vision of a free and diverse world and shape our policy to speed progress toward a more flexible world order

 this be the unify spirit of our policy in the world today the purpose of our aid program must be to help develop country move forward as rapidly as possible on the road to genuine national independence our military policy must assist nation to protect the process of democratic reform and development against disruption and intervention our diplomatic policy must strengthen our relation with the whole world with our several alliance and within the united nations

 as we press forward on every front to realize a flexible world order the role of the university become ever more important both as a reservoir of idea and as a repository of the long view of the shore dimly see

 knowledge be the great sun of the firmament say senator daniel webster life and power be scatter with all its beam

 in its light we must think and act not only for the moment but for our time i be remind of the story of the great french marshal lyautey who once ask his gardener to plant a tree the gardener object that the tree be slow grow and would not reach maturity for a hundred year the marshal reply in that case there be no time to lose plant it this afternoon

 today a world of knowledge a world of cooperation a just and last peace may be year away but we have no time to lose let we plant our tree this afternoon

general westmoreland general lemnitzer mr. secretary general decker general taylor member of the graduating class and their parent gentleman

 i want to express my appreciation for your generous invitation to come to this graduating class i be sure that all of you who sit here today realize particularly in view of the song we have just hear that you be part of a long tradition stretch back to the early day of this country 's history and that where you sit sit once some of the most celebrated name in our nation 's history and also some who be not so well know but who on 100 different battlefield in many war involve every generation of this country 's history have give very clear evidence of their commitment to their country

 so that i know you feel a sense of pride in be part of that tradition and as a citizen of the united states as well as president i want to express our high regard to all of you in appreciation for what you be do and what you will do for our country in the day ahead

 i would also like to announce at this time that as commander in chief i be exercise my privilege of direct the secretary of the army and the superintendent of west point to remit all exist confinement and other cadet punishment and i hope that it will be possible to carry this out today

 general westmoreland be slightly pain to hear that this be impend in view of the fact that one cadet who i be confident will some day be the head of the army have just be remit for 8 month and be about to be release but i be glad to have the opportunity to participate in the advancement of his military career

 my own confinement go for another two and a half year and i may ask for it to be extend instead of remit

 i want to say that i wish all of you the graduate success while i say that i be not unmindful of the fact that two graduate of this academy have reach the white house and neither be a member of my party until i be more certain that this trend will be break i wish that all of you may be general and not commanders in chief

 i want to say that i be sure you recognize that your schooling be only interrupt by today 's occasion and not end because the demand that will be make upon you in the service of your country in the come month and year will be really more pressing and in many way more burdensome as well as more challenging than ever before in our history i know that many of you may feel and many of our citizen may feel that in these day of the nuclear age when war may last in its final form a day or two or three day before much of the world be burn up that your service to your country will be only stand and wait nothing of course could be far from the truth i be sure that many americans believe that the day before world war ii be the golden age when the star be fall on all the graduate of west point that that be the golden time of service and that you have move into a period where military service while vital be not as challenging as it be then nothing could be far from the truth

 the fact of the matter be that the period just ahead in the next decade will offer more opportunity for service to the graduate of this academy than ever before in the history of the united states because all around the world in country which be heavily engage in the maintenance of their freedom graduate of this academy be heavily involve whether it be in viet nam or in laos or in thailand whether it be a military advisory group in iran whether it be a military attach in some latin american country during a difficult and challenging period whether it be the commander of our troop in south korea the burden that will be place upon you when you fill those position as you must inevitably will require more from you than ever before in our history the graduate of west point the naval academy and the air academy in the next 10 year will have the great opportunity for the defense of freedom that this academy 's graduate have ever have and i be sure that the joint chiefs of staff endorse that view know as they do and i do the heavy burden that be require of this academy 's graduate every day general tucker in laos or general harkins in viet nam and a dozen other who hold key and significant position involve the security of the united states and the defense of freedom you be go to follow in their footstep and i must say that i think that you will be privileged in the year ahead to find yourself so heavily involve in the great interest of this country

 therefore i hope that you realize and i hope every american realize how much we depend upon you your strictly military responsibility therefore will require a versatility and an adaptability never before require in either war or in peace they may involve the command and control of modern nuclear weapon and modern delivery system so complex that only a few scientist can understand their operation so devastating that their inadvertent use would be of worldwide concern but so new that their employment and their effect have never be test in combat condition

 on the other hand your responsibility may involve the command of more traditional force but in less traditional role man risk their life not as combatant but as instructor or adviser or as symbol of our nation 's commitment the fact that the united states be not directly at war in these area in no way diminish the skill and the courage that will be require the service to our country which be render or the pain of the casualty which be suffer

 to cite one final example of the range of responsibility that will fall upon you you may hold a position of command with our special force force which be too unconventional to be call conventional force which be grow in number and importance and significance for we now know that it be wholly misleading to call this the nuclear age or to say that our security rest only on the doctrine of massive retaliation

 korea have not be the only battleground since the end of the second world war man have fight and die in malaya in greece in the philippines in algeria and cuba and cyprus and almost continuously on the indo chinese peninsula no nuclear weapon have be fire no massive nuclear retaliation have be consider appropriate this be another type of war new in its intensity ancient in its origin war by guerrilla subversive insurgent assassin war by ambush instead of by combat by infiltration instead of aggression seek victory by erode and exhaust the enemy instead of engage he it be a form of warfare uniquely adapt to what have be strangely call war of liberation to undermine the effort of new and poor country to maintain the freedom that they have finally achieve it prey on economic unrest and ethnic conflict it require in those situation where we must counter it and these be the kind of challenge that will be before we in the next decade if freedom be to be save a whole new kind of strategy a wholly different kind of force and therefore a new and wholly different kind of military training

 but i have speak thus far only of the military challenge which your education must prepare you for the nonmilitary problem which you will face will also be most demanding diplomatic political and economic in the year ahead some of you will serve as adviser to foreign aid mission or even to foreign government some will negotiate term of a cease fire with broad political as well as military ramification some of you will go to the far corner of the earth and to the far reach of space some of you will sit in the high council of the pentagon other will hold delicate command post which be international in character still other will advise on plan to abolish arm instead of use they to abolish other whatever your position the scope of your decision will not be confine to the traditional tenet of military competence and training you will need to know and understand not only the foreign policy of the united states but the foreign policy of all country scatter around the world who 20 year ago be the most distant name to we you will need to give order in different tongue and read map by different system you will be involve in economic judgment which most economist would hesitate to make at what point for example do military aid become burdensome to a country and make its freedom endanger rather than help to secure it to what extent can the gold and dollar cost of our overseas deployment be offset by foreign procurement or at what stage can a new weapon system be consider sufficiently advanced to justify large dollar appropriation

 in many country your posture and performance will provide the local population with the only evidence of what our country be really like in other country your military mission its advice and action will play a key role in determine whether those people will remain free you will need to understand the importance of military power and also the limit of military power to decide what arm should be use to fight and when they should be use to prevent a fight to determine what represent our vital interest and what interest be only marginal

 above all you will have a responsibility to deter war as well as to fight it for the basic problem face the world today be not susceptible of a final military solution while we will long require the service and admire the dedication and commitment of the fight man of this country neither our strategy nor our psychology as a nation and certainly not our economy must become permanently dependent upon an ever increase military establishment

 our force therefore must fulfill a broad role as a complement to our diplomacy as an arm of our diplomacy as a deterrent to our adversary and as a symbol to our ally of our determination to support they

 that be why this academy have see its curriculum grow and expand in dimension in substance and in difficulty that be why you can not possibly have crowd into these 4 busy year all of the knowledge and all of the range of experience which you must bring to these subtle and delicate task which i have describe and that be why go to school year after year so you can serve this country to the good of your ability and your talent

 to talk of such talent and effort raise in the mind i be sure of everyone and the mind of all of our countryman why why should man such as you able to master the complex art of science mathematic language economy and all the rest devote their life to a military career with all of its risk and hardship why should their family be expect to make the personal and financial sacrifice that a military career inevitably bring with it when there be a visible enemy to fight in open combat the answer be not so difficult many serve all applaud and the tide of patriotism run high but when there be a long slow struggle with no immediate visible foe your choice will seem hard indeed and you will recall i be sure the line find in an old sentry box in gibraltar

 god and the soldier all man adore

 in time of trouble and no more

 for when war be over and all thing right

 god be neglect and the old soldier slight

 but you have one satisfaction however difficult those day may be when you be ask by a president of the united states or by any other american what you be do for your country no man 's answer will be clear than your own and that moral motivation which bring you here in the first place be part of your training here as well west point be not build to produce technical expert alone it be build to produce man commit to the defense of their country leader of man who understand the great stake which be involve leader who can be entrust with the heavy responsibility which modern weapon and the fight for freedom entail leader who can inspire in their man the same sense of obligation to duty which you bring to it

 there be no single slogan that you can repeat to yourself in hard day or give to those who may be associate with you in time past a simple phrase 54 40 or fight or to make the world safe for democracy"-that be enough but the time the weapon and the issue be now more complicated than ever

 eighteen year ago today ernie pyle describe those ten of thousand of young man who cross the ageless and indifferent sea of the english channel search in vain for a word to describe what they be fight for and finally he conclude that they be at least fight for each other

 you and i leave here today to meet our separate responsibility to protect our nation 's vital interest by peaceful mean if possible by resolute action if necessary and we go forth confident of support and success because we know that we be work and fight for each other and for all those man and woman all over the globe who be determined to be free

president griswold member of the faculty graduate and their family lady and gentleman
 let i begin by express my appreciation for the very deep honor that you have confer upon i as general de gaulle occasionally acknowledge america to be the daughter of europe so i be pleased to come to yale the daughter of harvard it might be say now that i have the good of both world a harvard education and a yale degree
 i be particularly glad to become a yale man because as i think about my trouble i find that a lot of they have come from other yale man among businessman i have have a minor disagreement with roger blough of the law school class of 1931 and i have have some complaint too from my friend henry ford of the class of 1940 in journalism i seem to have a difference with john hay whitney of the class of 1926 and sometimes i also displease henry luce of the class of 1920 not to mention also william f. buckley jr. of the class of 1950 i even have some trouble with my yale adviser i get along with they but i be not always sure how they get along with each other
 i have the warm feeling for chester bowles of the class of 1924 and for dean acheson of the class of 1915 and my assistant mcgeorge bundy of the class of 1940 but i be not 100 percent sure that these three wise and experienced yale man wholly agree with each other on every issue
 so this administration which aim at peaceful cooperation among all americans have be the victim of a certain natural pugnacity develop in this city among yale man now that i too be a yale man it be time for peace last week at west point in the historic tradition of that academy i avail myself of the power of commander in chief to remit all sentence of offend cadet in that same spirit and in the historic tradition of yale let i now offer to smoke the clay pipe of friendship with all of my brother ells and i hope that they may be friend not only with i but even with each other
 in any event i be very glad to be here and as a new member of the club i have be check to see what early link exist between the institution of the presidency and yale i find that a member of the class of 1878 william howard taft serve one term in the white house as preparation for become a member of this faculty and a graduate of 1804 john c. calhoun regard the vice presidency quite naturally as too lowly a status for a yale alumnus and become the only man in history to ever resign that office
 calhoun in 1804 and taft in 1878 graduate into a world very different from ours today they and their contemporary spend entire career stretch over 40 year in grapple with a few dramatic issue on which the nation be sharply and emotionally divide issue that occupy the attention of a generation at a time the national bank the disposal of the public land nullification or union freedom or slavery gold or silver today these old sweeping issue very largely have disappear the central domestic issue of our time be more subtle and less simple they relate not to basic clash of philosophy or ideology but to way and mean of reach common goal to research for sophisticated solution to complex and obstinate issue the world of calhoun the world of taft have its own hard problem and notable challenge but its problem be not our problem their age be not our age as every past generation have have to disenthrall itself from an inheritance of truism and stereotype so in our own time we must move on from the reassuring repetition of stale phrase to a new difficult but essential confrontation with reality
 for the great enemy of the truth be very often not the lie deliberate contrive and dishonest but the myth persistent persuasive and unrealistic too often we hold fast to the cliche of our forebear we subject all fact to a prefabricated set of interpretation we enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought
 mythology distract we everywhere in government as in business in politic as in economic in foreign affair as in domestic affair but today i want to particularly consider the myth and reality in our national economy in recent month many have come to feel as i do that the dialog between the party between business and government between the government and the public be clog by illusion and platitude and fail to reflect the true reality of contemporary american society
 i speak of these matter here at yale because of the self evident truth that a great university be always enlist against the spread of illusion and on the side of reality no one have say it more clearly than your president griswold liberal learning be both a safeguard against false idea of freedom and a source of true one your role as university man whatever your calling will be to increase each new generation 's grasp of its duty
 there be three great area of our domestic affair in which today there be a danger that illusion may prevent effective action they be first the question of the size and the shape of government 's responsibility second the question of public fiscal policy and third the matter of confidence business confidence or public confidence or simply confidence in america i want to talk about all three and i want to talk about they carefully and dispassionately and i emphasize that i be concern here not with political debate but with find way to separate false problem from real one
 if a contest in angry argument be force upon it no administration could shrink from response and history do not suggest that american president be totally without resource in an engagement force upon they because of hostility in one sector of society but in the wide national interest we need not partisan wrangling but common concentration on common problem i come here to this distinguished university to ask you to join in this great task
 let we take first the question of the size and shape of government the myth here be that government be big and bad and steadily get big and bad obviously this myth have some excuse for existence it be true that in recent history each new administration have spend much more money than its predecessor thus president roosevelt outspent president hoover and with allowance for the special case of the second world war president truman outspent president roosevelt just to prove that this be not a partisan matter president eisenhower then outspent president truman by the handsome figure of $ 182 billion it be even possible some think that this trend may continue
 but do it follow from this that big government be grow relatively big it do not for the fact be for the last 15 year the federal government and also the federal debt and also the federal bureaucracy have grow less rapidly than the economy as a whole if we leave defense and space expenditure aside the federal government since the second world war have expand less than any other major sector of our national life less than industry less than commerce less than agriculture less than high education and very much less than the noise about big government
 the truth about big government be the truth about any other great activity it be complex certainly it be true that size bring danger but it be also true that size can bring benefit here at yale which have contribute so much to our national progress in science and medicine it may be proper for i to mention one great and little noticed expansion of government which have bring strength to our whole society the new role of our federal government as the major patron of research in science and in medicine few people realize that in 1961 in support of all university research in science and medicine three dollar out of every four come from the federal government i need hardly point out that this have take place without undue enlargement of government control that american scientist remain second to none in their independence and in their individualism
 i be not suggest that federal expenditure can not bring some measure of control the whole thrust of federal expenditure in agriculture have be relate by purpose and design to control as a means of deal with the problem create by our farmer and our grow productivity each sector my point be of activity must be approach on its own merit and in term of specific national need generality in regard to federal expenditure therefore can be misleading each case science urban renewal education agriculture natural resource each case must be determine on its merit if we be to profit from our unrivaled ability to combine the strength of public and private purpose
 next let we turn to the problem of our fiscal policy here the myth be legion and the truth hard to find but let i take as a prime example the problem of the federal budget we persist in measure our federal fiscal integrity today by the conventional or administrative budget with result which would be regard as absurd in any business firm in any country of europe or in any careful assessment of the reality of our national finance the administrative budget have sound administrative use but for wide purpose it be less helpful it omit our special trust fund and the effect that they have on our economy it neglect change in asset or inventory it can not tell a loan from a straight expenditure and bad of all it can not distinguish between operate expenditure and long term investment
 this budget in relation to the great problem of federal fiscal policy which be basic to our economy in 1962 be not simply irrelevant it can be actively misleading and yet there be a mythology that measure all of our national soundness or unsoundness on the single simple basis of this same annual administrative budget if our federal budget be to serve not the debate but the country we must and will find way of clarify this area of discourse
 still in the area of fiscal policy let i say a word about deficit the myth persist that federal deficit create inflation and budget surplus prevent it yet sizeable budget surplus after the war do not prevent inflation and persistent deficit for the last several year have not upset our basic price stability obviously deficit be sometimes dangerous and so be surplus but honest assessment plainly require a more sophisticated view than the old and automatic cliche that deficit automatically bring inflation
 there be myth also about our public debt it be widely suppose that this debt be grow at a dangerously rapid rate in fact both the debt per person and the debt as a proportion of our gross national product have decline sharply since the second world war in absolute term the national debt since the end of world war ii have increase only 8 percent while private debt be increase 305 percent and the debt of state and local government on whom people frequently suggest we should place additional burden the debt of state and local government have increase 378 percent moreover debt public and private be neither good nor bad in and of themselves borrowing can lead to over extension and collapse but it can also lead to expansion and strength there be no single simple slogan in this field that we can trust
 finally i come to the problem of confidence confidence be a matter of myth and also a matter of truth and this time let i take the truth of the matter first
 it be true and of high importance that the prosperity of this country depend on the assurance that all major element within it will live up to their responsibility if business be to neglect its obligation to the public if labor be blind to all public responsibility above all if government be to abandon its obvious and statutory duty of watchful concern for our economic health if any of these thing should happen then confidence might well be weaken and the danger of stagnation would increase this be the true issue of confidence
 but there be also the false issue and its simple form be the assertion that any and all unfavorable turn of the speculative wheel however temporary and however plainly speculative in character be the result of and i quote a lack of confidence in the national administration this i must tell you while comfort be not wholly true bad it obscure the reality which be also simple the solid ground of mutual confidence be the necessary partnership of government with all of the sector of our society in the steady quest for economic progress
 corporate plan be not base on a political confidence in party leader but on an economic confidence in the nation 's ability to invest and produce and consume business have full confidence in the administration in power in 1929 1954 1958 and 1960 but this be not enough to prevent recession when business lack full confidence in the economy what matter be the capacity of the nation as a whole to deal with its economic problem and its opportunity
 the stereotype i have be discuss distract our attention and divide our effort these stereotype do our nation a disservice not just because they be exhausted and irrelevant but above all because they be mislead because they stand in the way of the solution of hard and complicated fact it be not new that past debate should obscure present reality but the damage of such a false dialogue be great today than ever before simply because today the safety of all the world the very future of freedom depend as never before upon the sensible and clearheade management of the domestic affair of the united states
 the real issue of our time be rarely as dramatic as the issue of calhoun the difference today be usually matter of degree and we can not understand and attack our contemporary problem in 1962 if we be bind by traditional label and wear out slogan of an early era but the unfortunate fact of the matter be that our rhetoric have not keep pace with the speed of social and economic change our political debate our public discourse on current domestic and economic issue too often bear little or no relation to the actual problem the united states face
 what be at stake in our economic decision today be not some grand warfare of rival ideology which will sweep the country with passion but the practical management of a modern economy what we need be not label and cliche but more basic discussion of the sophisticated and technical question involve in keep a great economic machinery move ahead
 the national interest lie in high employment and steady expansion of output in stable price and a strong dollar the declaration of such an objective be easy their attainment in an intricate and interdependent economy and world be a little more difficult to attain they we require not some automatic response but hard thought let i end by suggest a few of the real question on our national agenda
 first how can our budget and tax policy supply adequate revenue and preserve our balance of payment position without slow up our economic growth
 two how be we to set our interest rate and regulate the flow of money in way which will stimulate the economy at home without weaken the dollar abroad give the spectrum of our domestic and international responsibility what should be the mix between fiscal and monetary policy
 let i give several example from my experience of the complexity of these matter and how political label and ideological approach be irrelevant to the solution
 last week a distinguished graduate of this school senator proxmire of the class of 1938 who be ordinarily regard as a liberal democrat suggest that we should follow in meet our economic problem a stiff fiscal policy with emphasis on budget balance and an easy monetary policy with low interest rate in order to keep our economy go in the same week the bank for international settlement in basel switzerland a conservative organization represent the central banker of europe suggest that the appropriate economic policy in the united states should be the very opposite that we should follow a flexible budget policy as in europe with deficit when the economy be down and a high monetary policy on interest rate as in europe in order to control inflation and protect goal both may be right or wrong it will depend on many different factor
 the point be that this be basically an administrative or executive problem in which political label or cliche do not give we a solution
 a well know business journal this morning as i journey to new haven raise the prospect that a further budget deficit would bring inflation and encourage the flow of gold we have have several budget deficit begin with a $ 12 1/2 billion deficit in 1958 and it be true that in the fall of 1960 we have a gold dollar loss run at $ 5 billion annually this would seem to prove the case that a deficit produce inflation and that we lose gold yet there be no inflation follow the deficit of 1958 nor have there be inflation since then
 our wholesale price index since 1958 have remain completely level in spite of several deficit because the loss of gold have be due to other reason price instability relative interest rate relative export import balance national security expenditure all the rest
 let i give you a third and final example at the world bank meeting in september a number of american banker attend predict to their european colleague that because of the fiscal 1962 budget deficit there would be a strong inflationary pressure on the dollar and a loss of gold their prediction of inflation be share by many in business and help push the market up the recent reality of non inflation helped bring it down we have have no inflation because we have have other factor in our economy that have contribute to price stability
 i do not suggest that the government be right and they be wrong the fact of the matter be in the federal reserve board and in the administration this fall a similar view be hold by many well inform and disinterested man that inflation be the major problem that we would face in the winter of 1962 but it be not what i do suggest be that these problem be endlessly complicated and yet they go to the future of this country and its ability to prove to the world what we believe it must prove
 i be suggest that the problem of fiscal and monetary policy in the sixty as oppose to the kind of problem we face in the thirty demand subtle challenge for which technical answer not political answer must be provide these be matter upon which government and business may and in many case will disagree they be certainly matter that government and business should be discuss in the most dispassionate and careful way if we to maintain the kind of vigorous upon which our country depend
 how can we develop and sustain strong and stable world market for basic commodity without unfairness to the consumer and without undue stimulus to the producer how can we generate the buying power which can consume what we produce on our farm and in our factory how can we take advantage of the miracle of automation with the great demand that it will put upon highly skilled labor and yet offer employment to the half million of unskilled school dropout each year who enter the labor market eight million of they in the 1960 's
 how do we eradicate the barrier which separate substantial minority of our citizen from access to education and employment on equal term with the rest
 how in sum can we make our free economy work at full capacity that be provide adequate profit for enterprise adequate wage for labor adequate utilization of plant and opportunity for all
 these be the problem that we should be talk about that the political party and the various group in our country should be discuss they can not be solve by incantation from the forget past but the example of western europe show that they be capable of solution that government and many of they be conservative government prepare to face technical problem without ideological preconception can coordinate the element of a national economy and bring about growth and prosperity a decade of it
 some conversation i have hear in our own country sound like old record long playing leave over from the middle thirty the debate of the thirty have its great significance and produce great result but it take place in a different world with different need and different task it be our responsibility today to live in our own world and to identify the need and discharge the task of the 1960 's
 if there be any current trend toward meet present problem with old cliche this be the moment to stop it before it land we all in a bog of sterile acrimony
 discussion be essential and i be hopeful that the debate of recent week though up to now somewhat barren may represent the start of a serious dialog of the kind which have lead in europe to such fruitful collaboration among all the element of economic society and to a decade of unrivaled economic progress but let we not engage in the wrong argument at the wrong time between the wrong people in the wrong country while the real problem of our own time grow and multiply fertilize by our neglect
 nearly 150 year ago thomas jefferson write the new circumstance under which we be place call for new word new phrase and for the transfer of old word to new object new word new phrase the transfer of old word to new object that be truer today than it be in the time of jefferson because the role of this country be so vastly more significant there be a show in england call stop the world i want to get off you have not choose to exercise that option you be part of the world and you must participate in these day of our year in the solution of the problem that pour upon we require the most sophisticated and technical judgment and as we work in consonance to meet the authentic problem of our time we will generate a vision and an energy which will demonstrate anew to the world the superior vitality and the strength of the free society

president pitzer mr. vice president governor congressman thomas senator wiley and congressman miller mr. webb mr. bell scientist distinguished guest and lady and gentleman
 i appreciate your president having make i an honorary visit professor and i will assure you that my first lecture will be very brief
 i be delighted to be here and i be particularly delighted to be here on this occasion
 we meet at a college note for knowledge in a city note for progress in a state note for strength and we stand in need of all three for we meet in an hour of change and challenge in a decade of hope and fear in an age of both knowledge and ignorance the great our knowledge increase the great our ignorance unfold
 despite the striking fact that most of the scientist that the world have ever know be alive and work today despite the fact that this nation 's own scientific manpower be double every 12 year in a rate of growth more than three time that of our population as a whole despite that the vast stretch of the unknown and the unanswered and the unfinished still far outstrip our collective comprehension
 no man can fully grasp how far and how fast we have come but condense if you will the 50,000 year of man 's record history in a time span of but a half century state in these term we know very little about the first 40 year except at the end of they advanced man have learn to use the skin of animal to cover they then about 10 year ago under this standard man emerge from his cave to construct other kind of shelter only 5 year ago man learn to write and use a cart with wheel christianity begin less than 2 year ago the printing press come this year and then less than 2 month ago during this whole 50 year span of human history the steam engine provide a new source of power
 newton explore the meaning of gravity last month electric light and telephone and automobile and airplane become available only last week do we develop penicillin and television and nuclear power and now if america 's new spacecraft succeed in reach venus we will have literally reach the star before midnight tonight
 this be a breathtaking pace and such a pace can not help but create new ill as it dispel old new ignorance new problem new danger surely the opening vista of space promise high cost and hardship as well as high reward
 so it be not surprising that some would have we stay where we be a little long to rest to wait but this city of houston this state of texas this country of the united states be not build by those who wait and rest and wish to look behind they this country be conquer by those who move forward and so will space
 william bradford speak in 1630 of the founding of the plymouth bay colony say that all great and honorable action be accompany with great difficulty and both must be enterprised and overcome with answerable courage
 if this capsule history of our progress teach we anything it be that man in his quest for knowledge and progress be determined and can not be deter the exploration of space will go ahead whether we join in it or not and it be one of the great adventure of all time and no nation which expect to be the leader of other nation can expect to stay behind in this race for space
 those who come before we make certain that this country ride the first wave of the industrial revolution the first wave of modern invention and the first wave of nuclear power and this generation do not intend to founder in the backwash of the come age of space we mean to be a part of it we mean to lead it for the eye of the world now look into space to the moon and to the planet beyond and we have vow that we shall not see it govern by a hostile flag of conquest but by a banner of freedom and peace we have vow that we shall not see space fill with weapon of mass destruction but with instrument of knowledge and understanding
 yet the vow of this nation can only be fulfil if we in this nation be first and therefore we intend to be first in short our leadership in science and in industry our hope for peace and security our obligation to ourselves as well as other all require we to make this effort to solve these mystery to solve they for the good of all man and to become the world 's lead space fare nation
 we set sail on this new sea because there be new knowledge to be gain and new right to be win and they must be win and use for the progress of all people for space science like nuclear science and all technology have no conscience of its own whether it will become a force for good or ill depend on man and only if the united states occupy a position of pre eminence can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of peace or a new terrifying theater of war i do not say that we should or will go unprotected against the hostile misuse of space any more than we go unprotected against the hostile use of land or sea but i do say that space can be explore and master without feed the fire of war without repeat the mistake that man have make in extend his writ around this globe of our
 there be no strife no prejudice no national conflict in outer space as yet its hazard be hostile to we all its conquest deserve the good of all mankind and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again but why some say the moon why choose this as our goal and they may well ask why climb the high mountain why 35 year ago fly the atlantic why do rice play texas
 we choose to go to the moon we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other thing not because they be easy but because they be hard because that goal will serve to organize and measure the good of our energy and skill because that challenge be one that we be willing to accept one we be unwilling to postpone and one which we intend to win and the other too
 it be for these reason that i regard the decision last year to shift our effort in space from low to high gear as among the most important decision that will be make during my incumbency in the office of the presidency
 in the last 24 hour we have see facility now be create for the great and most complex exploration in man 's history we have feel the ground shake and the air shatter by the testing of a saturn c-1 booster rocket many time as powerful as the atlas which launch john glenn generate power equivalent to 10,000 automobile with their accelerator on the floor we have see the site where five f-1 rocket engine each one as powerful as all eight engine of the saturn combine will be cluster together to make the advanced saturn missile assemble in a new building to be build at cape canaveral as tall as a 48 story structure as wide as a city block and as long as two length of this field
 within these last 19 month at least 45 satellite have circle the earth some 40 of they be make in the united states of america and they be far more sophisticated and supply far more knowledge to the people of the world than those of the soviet union
 the mariner spacecraft now on its way to venus be the most intricate instrument in the history of space science the accuracy of that shot be comparable to fire a missile from cape canaveral and drop it in this stadium between the 40 yard line
 transit satellite be help our ship at sea to steer a safe course tiro satellite have give we unprecedented warning of hurricane and storm and will do the same for forest fire and iceberg
 we have have our failure but so have other even if they do not admit they and they may be less public
 to be sure we be behind and will be behind for some time in manned flight but we do not intend to stay behind and in this decade we shall make up and move ahead
 the growth of our science and education will be enrich by new knowledge of our universe and environment by new technique of learning and mapping and observation by new tool and computer for industry medicine the home as well as the school technical institution such as rice will reap the harvest of these gain
 and finally the space effort itself while still in its infancy have already create a great number of new company and ten of thousand of new job space and related industry be generate new demand in investment and skilled personnel and this city and this state and this region will share greatly in this growth what be once the furth outpost on the old frontier of the west will be the furth outpost on the new frontier of science and space houston your city of houston with its manned spacecraft center will become the heart of a large scientific and engineering community during the next 5 year the national aeronautics and space administration expect to double the number of scientist and engineer in this area to increase its outlay for salary and expense to $ 60 million a year to invest some $ 200 million in plant and laboratory facility and to direct or contract for new space effort over $ 1 billion from this center in this city
 to be sure all this cost we all a good deal of money this year 's space budget be three time what it be in january 1961 and it be great than the space budget of the previous 8 year combine that budget now stand at $ 5,400 million a year a staggering sum though somewhat less than we pay for cigarette and cigar every year space expenditure will soon rise some more from 40 cent per person per week to more than 50 cent a week for every man woman and child in the united states for we have give this program a high national priority even though i realize that this be in some measure an act of faith and vision for we do not now know what benefit await we but if i be to say my fellow citizen that we shall send to the moon 240,000 mile away from the control station in houston a giant rocket more than 300 foot tall the length of this football field make of new metal alloy some of which have not yet be invent capable of stand heat and stress several time more than have ever be experience fit together with a precision well than the fine watch carry all the equipment need for propulsion guidance control communication food and survival on an untried mission to an unknown celestial body and then return it safely to earth reentere the atmosphere at speed of over 25,000 mile per hour cause heat about half that of the temperature of the sun almost as hot as it be here today and do all this and do it right and do it first before this decade be out then we must be bold
 i be the one who be do all the work so we just want you to stay cool for a minute laughter
 however i think we be go to do it and i think that we must pay what need to be pay i do not think we ought to waste any money but i think we ought to do the job and this will be do in the decade of the sixty it may be do while some of you be still here at school at this college and university it will be do during the term of office of some of the people who sit here on this platform but it will be do and it will be do before the end of this decade
 i be delighted that this university be play a part in put a man on the moon as part of a great national effort of the united states of america
 many year ago the great british explorer george mallory who be to die on mount everest be ask why do he want to climb it he say because it be there
 well space be there and we be go to climb it and the moon and the planet be there and new hope for knowledge and peace be there and therefore as we set sail we ask god 's blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and great adventure on which man have ever embark
 thank you

the order of the court in the case of meredith versus fair be begin to be carry out mr. james meredith be now in residence on the campus of the university of mississippi

 this have be accomplish thus far without the use of national guard or other troop and it be to be hope that the law enforcement officer of the state of mississippi and the federal marshal will continue to be sufficient in the future

 all student member of the faculty and public official in both mississippi and the nation will be able it be hope to return to their normal activity with full confidence in the integrity of american law

 this be as it should be for our nation be found on the principle that observance of the law be the eternal safeguard of liberty and defiance of the law be the sure road to tyranny the law which we obey include the final ruling of the court as well as the enactment 's of our legislative body even among law abide man few law be universally love but they be uniformly respect and not resist

 americans be free in short to disagree with the law but not to disobey it for in a government of law and not of man no man however prominent or powerful and no mob however unruly or boisterous be entitle to defy a court of law if this country should ever reach the point where any man or group of man by force or threat of force could long defy the command of our court and our constitution then no law would stand free from doubt no judge would be sure of his writ and no citizen would be safe from his neighbor

 in this case in which the united states government be not until recently involve mr. meredith bring a private suit in federal court against those who be exclude he from the university a series of federal court all the way to the supreme court repeatedly order mr. meredith 's admission to the university when those order be defy and those who seek to implement they threaten with arrest and violence the united states court of appeals consist of chief judge tuttle of georgia judge hutcheson of texas judge rives of alabama judge jones of florida judge brown of texas judge wisdom of louisiana judge gewin of alabama and judge bell of georgia make clear the fact that the enforcement of its order have become an obligation of the united states government even though this government have not originally be a party to the case my responsibility as president be therefore inescapable i accept it my obligation under the constitution and the statute of the united states be and be to implement the order of the court with whatever mean be necessary and with as little force and civil disorder as the circumstance permit

 it be for this reason that i federalize the mississippi national guard as the most appropriate instrument should any be need to preserve law and order while united states marshal carry out the order of the court and prepare to back they up with whatever other civil or military enforcement might have be require

 i deeply regret the fact that any action by the executive branch be necessary in this case but all other avenue and alternative include persuasion and conciliation have be try and exhaust have the police power of mississippi been use to support the order of the court instead of deliberately and unlawfully block they have the university of mississippi fulfil its standard of excellence by quietly admit this applicant in conformity with what so many other southern state university have do for so many year a peaceable and sensible solution would have be possible without any federal intervention

 this nation be proud of the many instance in which governor educator and everyday citizen from the south have show to the world the gain that can be make by persuasion and good will in a society rule by law specifically i would like to take this occasion to express the thank of this nation to those southerner who have contribute to the progress of our democratic development in the entrance of student regardless of race to such great institution as the state support university of virginia north carolina georgia florida texas louisiana tennessee arkansas and kentucky

 i recognize that the present period of transition and adjustment in our nation 's southland be a hard one for many people neither mississippi nor any other southern state deserve to be charge with all the accumulate wrong of the last 100 year of race relation to the extent that there have be failure the responsibility for that failure must be share by we all by every state by every citizen

 mississippi and her university moreover be note for their courage for their contribution of talent and think to the affair of this nation this be the state of lucius lamar and many other who have place the national good ahead of sectional interest this be the state which have four medal of honor winner in the korean war alone in fact the guard unit federalize this morning early be part of the 155th infantry one of the 10 old regiment in the union and one of the most decorate for sacrifice and bravery in 6 war

 in 1945 a mississippi sergeant jake lindsey be honor by an unusual joint session of the congress i close therefore with this appeal to the student of the university the people who be most concerned

 you have a great tradition to uphold a tradition of honor and courage win on the field of battle and on the gridiron as well as the university campus you have a new opportunity to show that you be man of patriotism and integrity for the most effective mean of uphold the law be not the state policeman or the marshal or the national guard it be you it lie in your courage to accept those law with which you disagree as well as those with which you agree the eye of the nation and of all the world be upon you and upon all of we and the honor of your university and state be in the balance i be certain that the great majority of the student will uphold that honor

 there be in short no reason why the book on this case can not now be quickly and quietly close in the manner direct by the court let we preserve both the law and the peace and then heal those wound that be within we can turn to the great crisis that be without and stand unite as one people in our pledge to man 's freedom thank you and good night

good evening my fellow citizen

 this government as promise have maintain the close surveillance of the soviet military buildup on the island of cuba within the past week unmistakable evidence have establish the fact that a series of offensive missile site be now in preparation on that imprison island the purpose of these basis can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the western hemisphere

 upon receive the first preliminary hard information of this nature last tuesday morning at 9 a.m. i direct that our surveillance be step up and having now confirm and complete our evaluation of the evidence and our decision on a course of action this government feels oblige to report this new crisis to you in full detail

 the characteristic of these new missile site indicate two distinct type of installation several of they include medium range ballistic missile capable of carry a nuclear warhead for a distance of more than 1,000 nautical mile each of these missile in short be capable of strike washington d.c. the panama canal cape canaveral mexico city or any other city in the southeastern part of the united states in central america or in the caribbean area

 additional site not yet complete appear to be design for intermediate range bailistic missile capable of travel more than twice as far and thus capable of strike most of the major city in the western hemisphere range as far north as hudson bay canada and as far south as lima peru in addition jet bomber capable of carry nuclear weapon be now be uncrated and assemble in cuba while the necessary air basis be be prepare

 this urgent transformation of cuba into an important strategic base by the presence of these large long range and clearly offensive weapon of sudden mass destruction constitute an explicit threat to the peace and security of all the americas in flagrant and deliberate defiance of the rio pact of 1947 the tradition of this nation and hemisphere the joint resolution of the 87th congress the charter of the united nations and my own public warning to the soviets on september 4 and 13 this action also contradict the repeat assurance of soviet spokesman both publicly and privately deliver that the arm buildup in cuba would retain its original defensive character and that the soviet union have no need or desire to station strategic missile on the territory of any other nation

 the size of this undertaking make clear that it have be plan for some month yet only last month after i have make clear the distinction between any introduction of ground to ground missile and the existence of defensive antiaircraft missile the soviet government publicly state on september 11 that and i quote the armament and military equipment send to cuba be design exclusively for defensive purpose that and i quote the soviet government there be no need for the soviet government to shift its weapon for a retaliatory blow to any other country for instance cuba and that and i quote their government the soviet union have so powerful rocket to carry these nuclear warhead that there be no need to search for site for they beyond the boundary of the soviet union that statement be false

 only last thursday as evidence of this rapid offensive buildup be already in my hand soviet foreign minister gromyko tell i in my office that he be instruct to make it clear once again as he say his government have already do that soviet assistance to cuba and i quote pursue solely the purpose of contribute to the defense capability of cuba that and i quote he training by soviet specialist of cuban national in handle defensive armament be by no means offensive and if it be otherwise mr. gromyko go on the soviet government would never become involved in render such assistance that statement also be false

 neither the united states of america nor the world community of nation can tolerate deliberate deception and offensive threat on the part of any nation large or small we no long live in a world where only the actual firing of weapon represent a sufficient challenge to a nation 's security to constitute maximum peril nuclear weapon be so destructive and ballistic missile be so swift that any substantially increase possibility of their use or any sudden change in their deployment may well be regard as a definite threat to peace

 for many year both the soviet union and the united states recognize this fact have deploy strategic nuclear weapon with great care never upset the precarious status quo which insure that these weapon would not be use in the absence of some vital challenge our own strategic missile have never be transfer to the territory of any other nation under a cloak of secrecy and deception and our history unlike that of the soviets since the end of world war ii demonstrate that we have no desire to dominate or conquer any other nation or impose our system upon its people nevertheless american citizen have become adjust to live daily on the bull' eye of soviet missile locate inside the u.s.s.r. or in submarine

 in that sense missile in cuba add to an already clear and present danger although it should be note the nation of latin america have never previously be subject to a potential nuclear threat

 but this secret swift and extraordinary buildup of communist missile in an area well know to have a special and historical relationship to the united states and the nation of the western hemisphere in violation of soviet assurance and in defiance of american and hemispheric policy this sudden clandestine decision to station strategic weapon for the first time outside of soviet soil be a deliberately provocative and unjustified change in the status quo which can not be accept by this country if our courage and our commitment be ever to be trust again by either friend or foe

 the 1930 's teach we a clear lesson aggressive conduct if allow to go unchecked and unchallenged ultimately lead to war this nation be oppose to war we be also true to our word our unswerve objective therefore must be to prevent the use of these missile against this or any other country and to secure their withdrawal or elimination from the western hemisphere

 our policy have be one of patience and restraint as befit a peaceful and powerful nation which lead a worldwide alliance we have be determine not to be divert from our central concern by mere irritant and fanatic but now further action be require and it be under way and these action may only be the beginning we will not prematurely or unnecessarily risk the cost of worldwide nuclear war in which even the fruit of victory would be ashe in our mouth but neither will we shrink from that risk at any time it must be face

 acting therefore in the defense of our own security and of the entire western hemisphere and under the authority entrust to i by the constitution as endorse by the resolution of the congress i have direct that the follow initial step be take immediately

 first to halt this offensive buildup a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to cuba be be initiate all ship of any kind bind for cuba from whatever nation or port will if find to contain cargo of offensive weapon be turn back this quarantine will be extend if need to other type of cargo and carrier we be not at this time however deny the necessity of life as the soviets attempt to do in their berlin blockade of 1948

 second i have direct the continued and increase close surveillance of cuba and its military buildup the foreign minister of the oas in their communique of october 6 reject secrecy on such matter in this hemisphere should these offensive military preparation continue thus increase the threat to the hemisphere further action will be justify i have direct the armed forces to prepare for any eventuality and i trust that in the interest of both the cuban people and the soviet technician at the site the hazard to all concerned of continue this threat will be recognize

 third it shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launch from cuba against any nation in the western hemisphere as an attack by the soviet union on the united states require a full retaliatory response upon the soviet union

 fourth as a necessary military precaution i have reinforce our base at guantanamo evacuate today the dependent of our personnel there and order additional military unit to be on a standby alert basis

 fifth we be call tonight for an immediate meeting of the organ of consultation under the organization of american states to consider this threat to hemispheric security and to invoke article 6 and 8 of the rio treaty in support of all necessary action the united nations charter allow for regional security arrangement and the nation of this hemisphere decide long ago against the military presence of outside power our other ally around the world have also be alert

 sixth under the charter of the united nations we be ask tonight that an emergency meeting of the security council be convoke without delay to take action against this late soviet threat to world peace our resolution will call for the prompt dismantling and withdrawal of all offensive weapon in cuba under the supervision of u.n. observer before the quarantine can be lift

 seventh and finally i call upon chairman khrushchev to halt and eliminate this clandestine reckless and provocative threat to world peace and to stable relation between our two nation i call upon he far to abandon this course of world domination and to join in an historic effort to end the perilous arm race and to transform the history of man he have an opportunity now to move the world back from the abyss of destruction by return to his government 's own word that it have no need to station missile outside its own territory and withdraw these weapon from cuba by refrain from any action which will widen or deepen the present crisis and then by participate in a search for peaceful and permanent solution

 this nation be prepared to present its case against the soviet threat to peace and our own proposal for a peaceful world at any time and in any forum in the oas in the united nations or in any other meeting that could be useful without limit our freedom of action we have in the past make strenuous effort to limit the spread of nuclear weapon we have propose the elimination of all arm and military basis in a fair and effective disarmament treaty we be prepared to discuss new proposal for the removal of tension on both side include the possibility of a genuinely independent cuba free to determine its own destiny we have no wish to war with the soviet union for we be a peaceful people who desire to live in peace with all other people

 but it be difficult to settle or even discuss these problem in an atmosphere of intimidation that be why this late soviet threat or any other threat which be make either independently or in response to our action this week must and will be meet with determination any hostile move anywhere in the world against the safety and freedom of people to whom we be commit include in particular the brave people of west berlin will be meet by whatever action be need

 finally i want to say a few word to the captive people of cuba to whom this speech be be directly carry by special radio facility i speak to you as a friend as one who know of your deep attachment to your fatherland as one who share your aspiration for liberty and justice for all and i have watch and the american people have watch with deep sorrow how your nationalist revolution be betray and how your fatherland fall under foreign domination now your leader be no long cuban leader inspire by cuban ideal they be puppet and agent of an international conspiracy which have turn cuba against your friend and neighbor in the americas and turn it into the first latin american country to become a target for nuclear war the first latin american country to have these weapon on its soil

 these new weapon be not in your interest they contribute nothing to your peace and well being they can only undermine it but this country have no wish to cause you to suffer or to impose any system upon you we know that your life and land be be use as pawn by those who deny your freedom

 many time in the past the cuban people have rise to throw out tyrant who destroy their liberty and i have no doubt that most cubans today look forward to the time when they will be truly free free from foreign domination free to choose their own leader free to select their own system free to own their own land free to speak and write and worship without fear or degradation and then shall cuba be welcome back to the society of free nation and to the association of this hemisphere

 my fellow citizen let no one doubt that this be a difficult and dangerous effort on which we have set out no one can foresee precisely what course it will take or what cost or casualty will be incur many month of sacrifice and self discipline lie ahead month in which both our patience and our will be test month in which many threat and denunciation will keep we aware of our danger but the great danger of all would be to do nothing

 the path we have choose for the present be full of hazard as all path be but it be the one most consistent with our character and courage as a nation and our commitment around the world the cost of freedom be always high but americans have always pay it and one path we shall never choose and that be the path of surrender or submission

 our goal be not the victory of might but the vindication of right not peace at the expense of freedom but both peace and freedom here in this hemisphere and we hope around the world god willing that goal will be achieve

 thank you and good night

mr. vice president mr. speaker members of the 88th congress

 i congratulate you all not merely on your electoral victory but on your select role in history for you and i be privileged to serve the great republic in what could be the most decisive decade in its long history the choice we make for good or ill may well shape the state of the union for generation yet to come

 little more than 100 week ago i assume the office of president of the united states in seek the help of the congress and our countryman i pledge no easy answer i pledge and ask only toil and dedication these the congress and the people have give in good measure and today having witness in recent month a heighten respect for our national purpose and power having see the courageous calm of a united people in a perilous hour and having observe a steady improvement in the opportunity and well being of our citizen i can report to you that the state of this old but youthful union in the 175th year of its life be good

 in the world beyond our border steady progress have be make in build a world of order the people of west berlin remain both free and secure a settlement though still precarious have be reach in laos the spearpoint of aggression have be blunt in viet nam the end of agony may be in sight in the congo the doctrine of troika be dead and while danger continue a deadly threat have be remove in cuba

 at home the recession be behind we well over a million more man and woman be work today than be work 2 year ago the average factory workweek be once again more than 40 hour our industry be turn out more good than ever before and more than half of the manufacturing capacity that lie silent and waste 100 week ago be hum with activity

 in short both at home and abroad there may now be a temptation to relax for the road have be long the burden heavy and the pace consistently urgent

 but we can not be satisfied to rest here this be the side of the hill not the top the mere absence of war be not peace the mere absence of recession be not growth we have make a beginning but we have only begin

 now the time have come to make the most of our gain to translate the renewal of our national strength into the achievement of our national purpose

 america have enjoy 22 month of uninterrupted economic recovery but recovery be not enough if we be to prevail in the long run we must expand the long run strength of our economy we must move along the path to a high rate of growth and full employment

 for this would mean ten of billion of dollar more each year in production profit wage and public revenue it would mean an end to the persistent slack which have keep our unemployment at or above 5 percent for 61 out of the past 62 month and an end to the grow pressure for such restrictive measure as the 35 hour week which alone could increase hourly labor cost by as much as 14 percent start a new wage price spiral of inflation and undercut our effort to compete with other nation

 to achieve these great gain one step above all be essential the enactment this year of a substantial reduction and revision in federal income taxis

 for it be increasingly clear to those in government business and labor who be responsible for our economy 's success that our obsolete tax system exert too heavy a drag on private purchasing power profit and employment design to check inflation in early year it now check growth instead it discourage extra effort and risk it distort the use of resource it invite recurrent recession depress our federal revenue and cause chronic budget deficit

 now when the inflationary pressure of the war and the post war year no long threaten and the dollar command new respect now when no military crisis strain our resource now be the time to act we can not afford to be timid or slow for this be the most urgent task confront the congress in 1963

 in an early message i shall propose a permanent reduction in tax rate which will lower liability by $ 13.5 billion of this $ 11 billion result from reduce individual tax rate which now range between 20 and 91 percent to a more sensible range of 14 to 65 percent with a split in the present first bracket two and one half billion dollar result from reduce corporate tax rate from 52 percent which give the government today a majority interest in profit to the permanent pre korean level of 47 percent this be in addition to the more than $ 2 billion cut in corporate tax liability result from last year 's investment credit and depreciation reform

 to achieve this reduction within the limit of a manageable budgetary deficit i urge first that these cut be phase over 3 calendar year begin in 1963 with a cut of some $ 6 billion at annual rate second that these reduction be couple with select structural change begin in 1964 which will broaden the tax base end unfair or unnecessary preference remove or lighten certain hardship and in the net offset some $ 3.5 billion of the revenue loss and third that budgetary receipt at the outset be increase by $ 1.5 billion a year without any change in tax liability by gradually shift the tax payment of large corporation to a more current time schedule this combined program by increase the amount of our national income will in time result in still high federal revenue it be a fiscally responsible program the sure and the sound way of achieve in time a balanced budget in a balanced full employment economy

 this net reduction in tax liability of $ 10 billion will increase the purchase power of american family and business enterprise in every tax bracket with great increase go to our low income consumer it will in addition encourage the initiative and risk taking on which our free system depend induce more investment production and capacity use help provide the 2 million new job we need every year and reinforce the american principle of additional reward for additional effort

 i do not say that a measure for tax reduction and reform be the only way to achieve these goal

 --no doubt a massive increase in federal spending could also create job and growth but in today 's setting private consumer employer and investor should be give a full opportunity first

 --no doubt a temporary tax cut could provide a spur to our economy but a long run problem compel a long run solution

 --no doubt a reduction in either individual or corporation taxis alone would be of great help but corporation need customer and job seeker need job

 --no doubt tax reduction without reform would sound simple and more attractive to many but our growth be also hamper by a host of tax inequity and special preference which have distort the flow of investment

 --and finally there be no doubt some who would prefer to put off a tax cut in the hope that ultimately an end to the cold war would make possible an equivalent cut in expenditure but that end be not in view and to wait for it would be costly and self defeat

 in submit a tax program which will of course temporarily increase the deficit but can ultimately end it and in recognition of the need to control expenditure i will shortly submit a fiscal 1964 administrative budget which while allow for need rise in defense space and fix interest charge hold total expenditure for all other purpose below this year 's level

 this require the reduction or postponement of many desirable program the absorption of a large part of last year 's federal pay raise through personnel and other economy the termination of certain installation and project and the substitution in several program of private for public credit but i be convinced that the enactment this year of tax reduction and tax reform overshadow all other domestic problem in this congress for we can not for long lead the cause of peace and freedom if we ever cease to set the pace here at home

 tax reduction alone however be not enough to strengthen our society to provide opportunity for the four million americans who be bear every year to improve the life of 32 million americans who live on the outskirt of poverty

 the quality of american life must keep pace with the quantity of american good

 this country can not afford to be materially rich and spiritually poor

 therefore by hold down the budgetary cost of exist program to keep within the limitation i have set it be both possible and imperative to adopt other new measure that we can not afford to postpone

 these measure be base on a series of fundamental premise group under four relate heading

 first we need to strengthen our nation by invest in our youth

 --the future of any country which be dependent upon the will and wisdom of its citizen be damage and irreparably damage whenever any of its child be not educate to the full extent of his talent from grade school through graduate school today an estimate 4 out of every 10 student in the 5th grade will not even finish high school and that be a waste we can not afford

 --in addition there be no reason why one million young americans out of school and out of work should all remain unwanted and often untrained on our city street when their energy can be put to good use

 --finally the overseas success of our peace corps volunteer most of they young man and woman carry skill and idea to needy people suggest the merit of a similar corps serve our own community need in mental hospital on indian reservation in center for the aged or for young delinquent in school for the illiterate or the handicap as the idealism of our youth have serve world peace so can it serve the domestic tranquility

 second we need to strengthen our nation by safeguard its health

 --our work man and woman instead of be force to beg for help from public charity once they be old and ill should start contribute now to their own retirement health program through the social security system

 --moreover all our miracle of medical research will count for little if we can not reverse the grow nationwide shortage of doctor dentist and nurse and the widespread shortage of nursing home and modern urban hospital facility merely to keep the present ratio of doctor and dentist from decline any far we must over the next 10 year increase the capacity of our medical school by 50 percent and our dental school by 100 percent

 --finally and of deep concern i believe that the abandonment of the mentally ill and the mentally retarded to the grim mercy of custodial institution too often inflict on they and on their family a needless cruelty which this nation should not endure the incidence of mental retardation in this country be three time as high as that of sweden for example and that figure can and must be reduce

 third we need to strengthen our nation by protect the basic right of its citizen

 --the right to competent counsel must be assure to every man accuse of crime in federal court regardless of his mean

 --and the most precious and powerful right in the world the right to vote in a free american election must not be deny to any citizen on ground of his race or color i wish that all qualified americans permit to vote be willing to vote but surely in this centennial year of emancipation all those who be willing to vote should always be permit

 fourth we need to strengthen our nation by make the good and the most economical use of its resource and facility

 --our economic health depend on healthy transportation artery and i believe the way to a more modern economical choice of national transportation service be through increase competition and decrease regulation local mass transit fare even bad be as essential a community service as hospital and highway nearly three fourth of our citizen live in urban area which occupy only 2 percent of our land and if local transit be to survive and relieve the congestion of these city it need federal stimulation and assistance

 --next this government be in the storage and stockpile business to the melancholy tune of more than $ 16 billion we must continue to support farm income but we should not pile more farm surplus on top of the $ 7.5 billion we already own we must maintain a stockpile of strategic material but the $ 8.5 billion we have acquire for reason both good and bad be much more than we need and we should be empower to dispose of the excess in way which will not cause market disruption

 --finally our already overcrowded national park and recreation area will have twice as many visitor 10 year from now as they do today if we do not plan today for the future growth of these and other great natural asset not only park and forest but wildlife and wilderness preserve and water project of all kind our child and their child will be poor in every sense of the word

 these be not domestic concern alone for upon our achievement of great vitality and strength here at home hang our fate and future in the world our ability to sustain and supply the security of free man and nation our ability to command their respect for our leadership our ability to expand our trade without threat to our balance of payment and our ability to adjust to the change demand of cold war competition and challenge

 we shall be judge more by what we do at home than by what we preach abroad nothing we could do to help the develop country would help they half as much as a booming u.s. economy and nothing our opponent could do to encourage their own ambition would encourage they half as much as a chronic lag u.s. economy these domestic task do not divert energy from our security they provide the very foundation for freedom 's survival and success

 turn to the world outside it be only a few year ago in southeast asia africa eastern europe latin america even outer space that communism seek to convey the image of a unified confident and expand empire close in on a sluggish america and a free world in disarray but few people would hold to that picture today

 in these past month we have reaffirm the scientific and military superiority of freedom we have double our effort in space to assure we of be first in the future we have undertake the most far reach defense improvement in the peacetime history of this country and we have maintain the frontier of freedom from viet nam to west berlin

 but complacency or self congratulation can imperil our security as much as the weapon of tyranny a moment of pause be not a promise of peace dangerous problem remain from cuba to the south china sea the world 's prognosis prescribe in short not a year 's vacation for we but a year of obligation and opportunity

 four special avenue of opportunity stand out the atlantic alliance the develop nation the new sino soviet difficulty and the search for worldwide peace

 first how fare the grand alliance free europe be enter into a new phase of its long and brilliant history the era of colonial expansion have pass the era of national rivalry be fade and a new era of interdependence and unity be take shape defy the old prophecy of marx consent to what no conqueror could ever compel the free nation of europe be move toward a unity of purpose and power and policy in every sphere of activity

 for 17 year this movement have have our consistent support both political and economic far from resent the new europe we regard she as a welcome partner not a rival for the road to world peace and freedom be still long and there be burden which only full partner can share in support the common defense in expand world trade in align our balance of payment in aid the emergent nation in concert political and economic policy and in welcome to our common effort other industrialized nation notably japan whose remarkable economic and political development of the 1950 's permit it now to play on the world scene a major constructive role

 no doubt difference of opinion will continue to get more attention than agreement on action as europe move from independence to more formal interdependence but these be honest difference among honorable associate more real and frequent in fact among our western european ally than between they and the united states for the unity of freedom have never rely on uniformity of opinion but the basic agreement of this alliance on fundamental issue continue

 the first task of the alliance remain the common defense last month prime minister macmillan and i lay plan for a new stage in our long cooperative effort one which aim to assist in the wide task of frame a common nuclear defense for the whole alliance

 the nassau agreement recognize that the security of the west be indivisible and so must be our defense but it also recognize that this be an alliance of proud and sovereign nation and work well when we do not forget it it recognize far that the nuclear defense of the west be not a matter for the present nuclear power alone that france will be such a power in the future and that way must be find without increase the hazard of nuclear diffusion to increase the role of our other partner in planning man and direct a truly multilateral nuclear force within an increasingly intimate nato alliance finally the nassau agreement recognize that nuclear defense be not enough that the agree nato level of conventional strength must be meet and that the alliance can not afford to be in a position of have to answer every threat with nuclear weapon or nothing

 we remain too near the nassau decision and too far from their full realization to know their place in history but i believe that for the first time the door be open for the nuclear defense of the alliance to become a source of confidence instead of a cause of contention

 the next most pressing concern of the alliance be our common economic goal of trade and growth this nation continue to be concern about its balance of payment deficit which despite its decline remain a stubborn and troublesome problem we believe moreover that close economic tie among all free nation be essential to prosperity and peace and neither we nor the member of the european common market be so affluent that we can long afford to shelter high cost farm or factory from the wind of foreign competition or to restrict the channel of trade with other nation of the free world if the common market should move toward protectionism and restrictionism it would undermine its own basic principle this government mean to use the authority confer on it last year by the congress to encourage trade expansion on both side of the atlantic and around the world

 second what of the develop and nonaligned nation they be shock by the soviets sudden and secret attempt to transform cuba into a nuclear strike base and by communist china 's arrogant invasion of india they have be reassure by our prompt assistance to india by our support through the united nations of the congo 's unification by our patient search for disarmament and by the improvement in our treatment of citizen and visitor whose skin do not happen to be white and as the old colonialism recede and the neocolonialism of the communist power stand out more starkly than ever they realize more clearly that the issue in the world struggle be not communism versus capitalism but coercion versus free choice

 they be begin to realize that the longing for independence be the same the world over whether it be the independence of west berlin or viet nam they be begin to realize that such independence run athwart all communist ambition but be in keep with our own and that our approach to their diverse need be resilient and resourceful while the communists be still rely on ancient doctrine and dogma

 nevertheless it be hard for any nation to focus on an external or subversive threat to its independence when its energy be drain in daily combat with the force of poverty and despair it make little sense for we to assail in speech and resolution the horror of communism to spend $ 50 billion a year to prevent its military advance and then to begrudge spending largely on american product less than one tenth of that amount to help other nation strengthen their independence and cure the social chaos in which communism always have thrive

 i be proud and i think most americans be proud of a mutual defense and assistance program evolve with bipartisan support in three administration which have with all its recognize problem contribute to the fact that not a single one of the nearly fifty u.n. member to gain independence since the second world war have succumb to communist control

 i be proud of a program that have help to arm and feed and clothe million of people who live on the front line of freedom

 i be especially proud that this country have put forward for the 60 be a vast cooperative effort to achieve economic growth and social progress throughout the americas the alliance for progress

 i do not underestimate the difficulty that we face in this mutual effort among our close neighbor but the free state of this hemisphere work in close collaboration have begin to make this alliance a living reality today it be feed one out of every four school age child in latin america an extra food ration from our farm surplus it have distribute 1.5 million school book and be build 17,000 classroom it have help resettle ten of thousand of farm family on land they can call their own it be stimulate our good neighbor to more self help and self reform fiscal social institutional and land reform it be bring new housing and hope new health and dignity to million who be forget the man and woman of this hemisphere know that the alliance can not succeed if it be only another name for united states handout that it can succeed only as the latin american nation themselves devote their good effort to fulfil its goal

 this story be the same in africa in the middle east and in asia wherever nation be willing to help themselves we stand ready to help they build new bulwark of freedom we be not purchase vote for the cold war we have go to the aid of imperiled nation neutral and ally alike what we do ask and all that we ask be that our help be use to good advantage and that their own effort not be divert by needless quarrel with other independent nation

 despite all its past achievement the continued progress of the mutual assistance program require a persistent discontent with present performance we have be reorganize this program to make it a more effective efficient instrument and that process will continue this year

 but free world development will still be an uphill struggle government aid can only supplement the role of private investment trade expansion commodity stabilization and above all internal self improvement the process of growth be gradual bear fruit in a decade not a day our success will be neither quick nor dramatic but if these program be ever to be end our failure in a dozen country would be sudden and certain

 neither money nor technical assistance however can be our only weapon against poverty in the end the crucial effort be one of purpose require the fuel of finance but also a torch of idealism and nothing carry the spirit of this american idealism more effectively to the far corner of the earth than the american peace corps

 a year ago less than 900 peace corps volunteer be on the job a year from now they will number more than 9,000 man and woman age 18 to 79 willing to give 2 year of their life to help people in other land

 there be in fact nearly a million americans serve their country and the cause of freedom in overseas post a record no other people can match surely those of we who stay at home should be glad to help indirectly by support our aid program .by open our door to foreign visitor and diplomat and student and by proving day by day by deed as well as word that we be a just and generous people

 third what comfort can we take from the increase strain and tension within the communist bloc here hope must be temper with caution for the soviet chinese disagreement be over mean not end a dispute over how good to bury the free world be no ground for western rejoicing

 nevertheless while a strain be not a fracture it be clear that the force of diversity be at work inside the communist camp despite all the iron discipline of regimentation and all the iron dogmatism 's of ideology marx be prove wrong once again for it be the closed communist society not the free and open society which carry within themselves the seed of internal disintegration

 the disarray of the communist empire have be heighten by two other formidable force one be the historical force of nationalism and the yearning of all man to be free the other be the gross inefficiency of their economy for a closed society be not open to idea of progress and a police state find that it can not command the grain to grow

 new nation ask to choose between two compete system need only compare condition in east and west germany eastern and western europe north and south viet nam they need only compare the disillusionment of communist cuba with the promise of the alliance for progress and all the world know that no successful system build a wall to keep its people in and freedom out and the wall of shame divide berlin be a symbol of communist failure

 finally what can we do to move from the present pause toward endure peace again i would counsel caution i foresee no spectacular reversal in communist method or goal but if all these trend and development can persuade the soviet union to walk the path of peace then let she know that all free nation will journey with she but until that choice be make and until the world can develop a reliable system of international security the free people have no choice but to keep their arm nearby

 this country therefore continue to require the good defense in the world a defense which be suit to the sixty this mean unfortunately a rise defense budget for there be no substitute for adequate defense and no bargain basement way of achieve it it mean the expenditure of more than $ 15 billion this year on nuclear weapon system alone a sum which be about equal to the combine defense budget of our european allies

 but it also mean improve air and missile defense improve civil defense a strengthened anti guerrilla capacity and of prime importance more powerful and flexible nonnuclear force for threat of massive retaliation may not deter piecemeal aggression and a line of destroyer in a quarantine or a division of well equip man on a border may be more useful to our real security than the multiplication of awesome weapon beyond all rational need

 but our commitment to national safety be not a commitment to expand our military establishment indefinitely we do not dismiss disarmament as merely an idle dream for we believe that in the end it be the only way to assure the security of all without impair the interest of any nor do we mistake honorable negotiation for appeasement while we shall never weary in the defense of freedom neither shall we ever abandon the pursuit of peace

 in this quest the united nations require our full and continued support its value in serve the cause of peace have be show anew in its role in the west new guinea settlement in its use as a forum for the cuban crisis and in its task of unification in the congo today the united nations be primarily the protector of the small and the weak and a safety valve for the strong tomorrow it can form the framework for a world of law a world in which no nation dictate the destiny of another and in which the vast resource now devoted to destructive mean will serve constructive end

 in short let our adversary choose if they choose peaceful competition they shall have it if they come to realize that their ambition can not succeed if they see their war of liberation and subversion will ultimately fail if they recognize that there be more security in accept inspection than in permit new nation to master the black art of nuclear war and if they be willing to turn their energy as we be to the great unfinished task of our own people then surely the area of agreement can be very wide indeed a clear understanding about berlin stability in southeast asia an end to nuclear testing new check on surprise or accidental attack and ultimately general and complete disarmament

 for we seek not the worldwide victory of one nation or system but a worldwide victory of man the modern globe be too small its weapon be too destructive and its disorder be too contagious to permit any other kind of victory

 to achieve this end the united states will continue to spend a great portion of its national production than any other people in the free world for 15 year no other free nation have demand so much of itself through hot war and cold through recession and prosperity through the age of the atom and outer space the american people have never falter and their faith have never flag if at time our action seem to make life difficult for other it be only because history have make life difficult for we all

 but difficult day need not be dark i think these be proud and memorable day in the cause of peace and freedom we be proud for example of major rudolf anderson who give his life over the island of cuba we salute specialist james allen johnson who die on the border of south korea we pay honor to sergeant gerald pendell who be kill in viet nam they be among the many who in this century far from home have die for our country our task now and the task of all americans be to live up to their commitment

 my friend i close on a note of hope we be not lull by the momentary calm of the sea or the somewhat clear sky above we know the turbulence that lie below and the storm that be beyond the horizon this year but now the wind of change appear to be blow more strongly than ever in the world of communism as well as our own for 175 year we have sail with those wind at our back and with the tide of human freedom in our favor we steer our ship with hope as thomas jefferson say leave fear astern

 today we still welcome those wind of change and we have every reason to believe that our tide be run strong with thank to almighty god for see we through a perilous passage we ask his help anew in guide the good ship union

mr. chancellor mr. vanderbilt senator kefauver senator gore congressman fulton congressman evins congressman bass congressman everett tom murray distinguished guest member of the judiciary the army corps of engineers of the tennessee valley

 i first of all want to express my warm appreciation to the governor and to the mayor of this state and city and to the people for a very generous welcome and particularly to all those young man and woman who line the street and play music for we as we drive into this stadium we be glad they be here with we and we feel the musical future of this city and state be assure

 many thing bring we together today we be salute the 90th anniversary of vanderbilt university which have grow from a small tennessee university and institution to one of our nation 's great with 7 different college and with more than half of its 4200 student from outside of the state of tennessee

 and we be salute the 30th anniversary of the tennessee valley authority which transform a parch depressed and floodravage region into a fertile productive center of industry science and agriculture

 we be salute by initiate construction of a dam in his name a great tennessee statesman cordell hull the father of reciprocal trade the grandfather of the united nations the secretary of state who preside over the transformation of this nation from a life of isolation and almost indifference to a state of responsible world leadership

 and finally we be salute by the recognition of a forthcoming dam in his name j. percy priest a former colleague of mine in the house of representatives who represent this district this state and this nation in the congress for 16 turbulent year year which witness the crumbling of empire the splitting of the atom the conquest of one threat to freedom and the emergence of still another

 if there be one unchanging theme that run throughout these separate story it be that everything change but change itself we live in an age of movement and change both evolutionary and revolutionary both good and evil and in such an age a university have a special obligation to hold fast to the good of the past and move fast to the good of the future

 nearly 100 year ago prince bismarck say that one third of the student of german university break down from overwork another third break down from dissipation and the other third rule germany i do not know which third of the student body of vanderbilt be here today but i be confident we be talk to the future ruler of tennessee and america in the spirit of this university

 the essence of vanderbilt be still learn the essence of its outlook be still liberty and liberty and learning will be and must be the touchstone of vanderbilt university and of any free university in this country or the world i say two touchstone yet they be almost inseparable inseparable if not indistinguishable for liberty without learn be always in peril and learn without liberty be always in vain

 this state this city this campus have stand long for both human right and human enlightenment and let that forever be true this nation be now engage in a continue debate about the right of a portion of its citizen that will go on and those right will expand until the standard first forge by the nation 's founder have be reach and all americans enjoy equal opportunity and liberty under law

 but this nation be not found solely on the principle of citizen right equally important though too often not discuss be the citizen 's responsibility for our privilege can be no great than our obligation the protection of our right can endure no long than the performance of our responsibility each can be neglect only at the peril of the other i speak to you today therefore not of your right as americans but of your responsibility they be many in number and different in nature they do not rest with equal weight upon the shoulder of all equality of opportunity do not mean equality of responsibility all americans must be responsible citizen but some must be more responsible than other by virtue of their public or their private position their role in the family or community their prospect for the future or their legacy from the past

 increase responsibility go with increase ability for of those to whom much be give much be require

 commodore vanderbilt recognize this responsibility and his recognition make possible the establishment of a great institution of learn for which he will be long remember after his steamboat and railroad have be forget i speak in particular therefore of the responsibility of the educate citizen include the student the faculty and the alumnus of this great institution the creation and maintenance of vanderbilt university like that of all great university have require considerable effort and expenditure and i can not believe that all of this be undertake merely to give this school 's graduate an economic advantage in the life struggle every man send out from a university say professor woodrow wilson every man send out from a university should be a man of his nation as well as a man of his time

 you have responsibility in short to use your talent for the benefit of the society which help develop those talent you must decide as goethe put it whether you will be an anvil or a hammer whether you will give to the world in which you be rear and educate the broad possible benefit of that education of the many special obligation incumbent upon an educate citizen i would cite three as outstanding your obligation to the pursuit of learn your obligation to serve the public your obligation to uphold the law

 if the pursuit of learning be not defend by the educate citizen it will not be defend at all for there will always be those who scoff at intellectual who cry out against research who seek to limit our educational system modern cynic and skeptic see no more reason for land a man on the moon which we shall do than the cynic and skeptic of half a millennium ago see for the discovery of this country they see no harm in pay those to whom they entrust the mind of their child a small wage than be pay to those to whom they entrust the care of their plumbing

 but the educate citizen know how much more there be to know he know that knowledge be power more so today than ever before he know that only an educated and informed people will be a free people that the ignorance of one voter in a democracy impairs the security of all and that if we can as jefferson put it enlighten the people generally tyranny and the oppression of mind and body will vanish like evil spirit at the dawn of day and therefore the educate citizen have a special obligation to encourage the pursuit of learn to promote exploration of the unknown to preserve the freedom of inquiry to support the advancement of research and to assist at every level of government the improvement of education for all americans from grade school to graduate school

 secondly the educate citizen have an obligation to serve the public he may be a precinct worker or president he may give his talent at the courthouse the state house the white house he may be a civil servant or a senator a candidate or a campaign worker a winner or a loser but he must be a participant and not a spectator

 at the olympic game aristotle write it be not the fine and strong man who be crown but they who enter the list for out of these the prize man be elect so too in life of the honorable and the good it be they who act who rightly win the prize

 i urge all of you today especially those who be student to act to enter the list of public service and rightly win or lose the prize for we can have only one form of aristocracy in this country as jefferson write long ago in reject john adams suggestion of an artificial aristocracy of wealth and birth it be he write the natural aristocracy of character and talent and the good form of government he add be that which select these man for position of responsibility

 i would hope that all educate citizen would fulfill this obligation in politic in government here in nashville here in this state in the peace corps in the foreign service in the government service in the tennessee valley in the world you will find the pressure great than the pay you may endure more public attack than support but you will have the unequaled satisfaction of know that your character and talent be contribute to the direction and success of this free society

 third and finally the educate citizen have an obligation to uphold the law this be the obligation of every citizen in a free and peaceful society but the educate citizen have a special responsibility by the virtue of his great understanding for whether he have ever study history or current event ethic or civic the rule of a profession or the tool of a trade he know that only a respect for the law make it possible for free man to dwell together in peace and progress

 he know that law be the adhesive force in the cement of society create order out of chaos and coherence in place of anarchy he know that for one man to defy a law or court order he do not like be to invite other to defy those which they do not like lead to a breakdown of all justice and all order he know too that every fellowman be entitle to be regard with decency and treat with dignity any educate citizen who seek to subvert the law to suppress freedom or to subject other human being to act that be less than human degrade his heritage ignore his learning and betray his obligation

 certain other society may respect the rule of force we respect the rule of law

 the nation indeed the whole world have watch recent event in the united states with alarm and dismay no one can deny the complexity of the problem involve in assure to all of our citizen their full fight as americans but no one can gainsay the fact that the determination to secure these right be in the high tradition of american freedom

 in these moment of tragic disorder a special burden rest on the educate man and woman of our country to reject the temptation of prejudice and violence and to reaffirm the value of freedom and law on which our free society depend

 when bishop mctyeire 90 year ago propose it to commodore vanderbilt he say commodore our country have be tear to piece by a civil war we want to repair this damage and commodore vanderbilt reportedly reply i want to unite this country and all section of it so that all our people will be one his response his recognition of his obligation and opportunity give vanderbilt university not only an endowment but also a mission now 90 year later in a time of tension it be more important than ever to unite this country and strengthen these tie so that all of our people will be one

 ninety year from now i have no doubt that vanderbilt university will still be fulfil this mission it will still uphold learning encourage public service and teach respect for the law it will neither turn its back on prove wisdom or turn its face from newborn challenge it will still pass on to the youth of our land the full meaning of their right and their responsibility and it will still be teach the truth the truth that make we free and will keep we free thank you

on this hallowed ground heroic deed be perform and eloquent word be speak a century ago

 we the living have not forget and the world will never forget the deed or the word of gettysburg we honor they now as we join on this memorial day of 1963 in a prayer for permanent peace of the world and fulfillment of our hope for universal freedom and justice

 we be call to honor our own word of reverent prayer with resolution in the deed we must perform to preserve peace and the hope of freedom

 we keep a vigil of peace around the world

 until the world know no aggressor until the arm of tyranny have be lay down until freedom have rise up in every land we shall maintain our vigil to make sure our son who die on foreign field shall not have die in vain

 as we maintain the vigil of peace we must remember that justice be a vigil too a vigil we must keep in our own street and school and among the life of all our people so that those who die here on their native soil shall not have die in vain

 one hundred year ago the slave be free

 one hundred year later the negro remain in bondage to the color of his skin

 the negro today ask justice

 we do not answer he we do not answer those who lie beneath this soil when we reply to the negro by ask patience

 it be empty to plead that the solution to the dilemma of the present rest on the hand of the clock the solution be in our hand unless we be willing to yield up our destiny of greatness among the civilization of history americans white and negro together must be about the business of resolve the challenge which confront we now

 our nation find its soul in honor on these field of gettysburg one hundred year ago we must not lose that soul in dishonor now on the field of hate

 to ask for patience from the negro be to ask he to give more of what he have already give enough but to fail to ask of he and of all americans perseverance within the process of a free and responsible society would be to fail to ask what the national interest require of all its citizen

 the law can not save those who deny it but neither can the law serve any who do not use it the history of injustice and inequality be a history of disuse of the law law have not fail and be not fail we as a nation have fail ourselves by not trust the law and by not use the law to gain soon the end of justice which law alone serve

 if the white over estimate what he have do for the negro without the law the negro may under estimate what he be do and can do for himself with the law

 if it be empty to ask negro or white for patience it be not empty it be merely honest to ask perseverance man may build barricade and other may hurl themselves against those barricade but what would happen at the barricade would yield no answer the answer will only be work by our perseverance together it be deceit to promise more as it would be cowardice to demand less

 in this hour it be not our respective race which be at stake it be our nation let those who care for their country come forward north and south white and negro to lead the way through this moment of challenge and decision

 the negro say now other say never the voice of responsible americans the voice of those who die here and the great man who speak here their voice say together there be no other way

 until justice be blind to color until education be unaware of race until opportunity be unconcerned with the color of man 's skin emancipation will be a proclamation but not a fact to the extent that the proclamation of emancipation be not fulfil in fact to that extent we shall have fall short of assure freedom to the free

general secretary zuckert general lemay members of the congress mr. fraser fellow graduate

 i want to express my appreciation for become an instant graduate of this academy and consider it a high honor

 mr. salinger press secretary of the white house receive the following letter several day ago

 dear sir

 would you desire to become an honorary member of the air force cadet wing for grant one small favor your name mr. salinger shall become more hallowed and revere than the combine memory of generals mitchell arnold and doolittle

 my humble desire be that you convey a request from the cadet wing to the president sir there be countless number of our group who be oppress by class 3 punishment the bane of cadet everywhere the president be our only hope for salvation by grant amnesty to our oppressed brother he and you could end your anguish and depression

 please sir help we return to the rank of the living so that we may work for the new frontier with enthusiasm and vigor

 it be sign sincerely cadet marvin b. hopkins who be obviously go to be a future general

 as mr. salinger want to be honor with generals mitchell arnold and doolittle i therefore take great pleasure in grant amnesty to all those who not only deserve it but need it

 it be customary for speaker on these occasion to say in graduate address that commencement signify the beginning instead of an end yet this think apply with particular force to those of you who be graduate from our nation 's service academy today for today you receive not only your degree but also your commission and tomorrow you join with all those in the military service in the foreign service the civil service and elsewhere and one million of they serve outside our frontier who have choose to serve the great republic at a turning point in our history you will have an opportunity to help make that history an opportunity for a service career more varied and demanding than any that have be open to any officer corp in the history of any country

 there be some who might be skeptical of that assertion they claim that the future of the air force be mortgage to an obsolete weapon system the manned aircraft or that air force officer of the future will be nothing more than silent silo sitter but nothing could be far from the truth it be this very onrush of technology which demand an expand role for the nation 's air force and air force officer and which guarantee that an air force career in the next 40 year will be even more changing and more challenging than the career of the last 40 year

 for some of you will travel where no man have ever travel before some of you will fly the fast plane that have ever be build reach the high altitude that man have ever go to and lift the heavy payload of any aviator in history some of you will hold in your hand the most awesome destructive power which any nation or any man have conceive some of you will work with the leader of new nation which be not even nation a few year ago some of you will support guerrilla and counter guerrilla operation that combine the new technique of warfare with the old technique of the jungle and some of you will help develop new plane that spread their wing in flight detect other plane at an unheard of distance deliver new weapon with unprecedented accuracy and survey the ground from incredible height as a testament to our strong faith in the future of air power and the manned airplane

 i be announce today that the united states will commit itself to an important new program in civilian aviation civilian aviation long both the beneficiary and the benefactor of military aviation be of necessity equally dynamic neither the economic nor the politic of international air competition permit we to stand still in this area today the challenging new frontier in commercial aviation and in military aviation be a frontier already cross by the military supersonic flight lead member of the administration under the chairmanship of the vice president have be consider carefully the role to be play by the national government in determine the economic and technical feasibility of an american commercial supersonic aircraft and in the development of such an aircraft if it be feasible

 having review their recommendation it be my judgment that this government should immediately commence a new program in partnership with private industry to develop at the early practical date the prototype of a commercially successful supersonic transport superior to that be build in any other country of the world an open preliminary design competition will be initiate immediately among american airframe and powerplant manufacturer with a more detailed design phase to follow if these initial phase do not produce an aircraft capable of transport people and good safely swiftly and at price the traveler can afford and the airline find profitable we shall not go far

 but if we can build the good operational plane of this type and i believe we can then the congress and the country should be prepared to invest the fund and effort necessary to maintain this nation 's lead in long range aircraft a lead we have hold since the end of the second world war a lead we should make every responsible effort to maintain spur by competition from across the atlantic and by the productivity of our own company the federal government must pledge fund to supplement the risk capital to be contribute by private company it must then rely heavily on the flexibility and ingenuity of private enterprise to make the detailed decision and to introduce successfully this new jet age transport into worldwide service and we be talk about a plane in the end of the 60 's that will move ahead at a speed fast than mach 2 to all corner of the globe this commitment i believe be essential to a strong and forward look nation and indicate the future of the manned aircraft as we move into a missile age as well

 the fact that the great value of all of the weapon of massive retaliation lie in their ability to deter war do not diminish their importance nor will national security in the year ahead be achieve simply by pile up big bomb or bury our missile under big load of concrete for in an imperfect world where human folly have be the rule and not the exception the sure way to bring on the war that can never happen be to sit back and assure ourselves it will not happen the existence of mutual nuclear deterrent can not be shrug off as stalemate for our national security in a period of rapid change will depend on constant reappraisal of our present doctrine on alertness to new development on imagination and resourcefulness and new idea stalemate be a static term and not one of you would be here today if you believe you be enter an outmoded service require only custodial duty in a period of nuclear stalemate

 i be impress by the extraordinary scholastic record unmatched by any new college or university in this country which have be make by the student and graduate of this academy four rhodes scholarship last year two this year and other select scholarship and also your record in the graduate record examination make the people of this country proud of this academy and the air force which make it possible

 this country be proud of the fact that more than one out of five of your all military faculty have a doctor 's degree and all the rest have master 's degree this be what we need for leadership in our military service for the air force officer of today and tomorrow require the broad kind of scholarship to understand a most complex and change world he require understanding and learn unmatched in the day before world war ii any graduate of this academy who serve in our armed forces will need to know economic and history and international affair and language you will need an appreciation of other society and an understanding of our own nation 's purpose and policy

 general norstad 's leadership in nato general smart 's outstanding tour of duty as the senior military representative in japan be example of air force officer who use their broad talent for the benefit of our country many of you will have similar opportunity to represent this country in negotiation with our adversary as well as our friend work with international organization work in every way in the hundred free country around the globe to help they maintain their freedom your major responsibility in the final analysis will relate to military command some of you may be member of the joint chiefs of staff and participate as adviser to the president who hold office

 last october 's crisis in the caribbean amply demonstrate that military policy and power can not and must not be separate from political and diplomatic decision whatever the military motive and implication of the reckless attempt to put missile on the island of cuba the political and psychological implication be equally important we need in october and we have they and we shall need they in the future and we shall have they military commander who be conscious of the enormous stake in the nuclear age of every decision that they take who be aware of the fact that there be no purely political .decision or purely military decision that .every problem be a mixture of both man who know the difference between vital interest and peripheral interest who can maneuver military force with judgment and precision as well as courage and determination and who can foresee the effect of military action on political policy we need man in short who can cope with the challenge of a new political struggle an armed doctrine which use every weapon in the struggle around the globe

 we live in a world in short where the principal problem that we face be not susceptible to military solution alone the role of our military power in essence be therefore to free ourselves and our ally to pursue the goal of freedom without the danger of enemy attack but we do not have a separate military policy and a separate diplomatic policy and a separate disarmament policy and a separate foreign aid policy all unrelated to each other they be all bind up together in the policy of the united states our goal be a coherent overall national security policy one that truly serve the good interest of this country and those who depend upon it it be worth note that all of the decision which we now face today will come in increase number in the month and year ahead

 i want to congratulate all of you who have choose the united states air force as a career as far as any of we can now see in washington in the day ahead you will occupy position of the high responsibility and merely because we move into a change period of weapon technology as well as political challenge because in fact we move into that period there be great need for you than ever before you here today on this field your colleague at omaha nebraska or at eglin in florida or who may be station in western europe or man who be at sea in ship hundred of mile from land or soldier in camp in texas or on the island of okinawa they maintain the freedom by be on the ready they maintain the freedom the security and the peace not only of the united states but of the dozen of country who be ally to we who be close to the communist power and who depend upon we and in a sense only upon we for their freedom and security these distant ship these distant plane these distant man keep the peace in a great half circle stretch all the way from berlin to south korea this be the role which history and our own determination have place upon a country which live most of its history in isolation and neutrality and yet in the last 18 year have carry the burden for free people everywhere i think that this be a burden which we accept willingly recognize that if this country do not accept it no people will recognize that in the most difficult time in the whole life of freedom the united states be call upon to play its great role this be a role which we be proud to accept and i be particularly proud to see the united states accept it in the presence of these young man who have commit themselves to the service of our country and to the cause of its freedom i congratulate you all and most of all i congratulate your mother and father who make it possible

 thank you

president anderson member of the faculty board of trustee distinguished guest my old colleague senator bob byrd who have earn his degree through many year of attend night law school while i be earn mine in the next 30 minute lady and gentleman
 it be with great pride that i participate in this ceremony of the american university sponsor by the methodist church found by bishop john fletcher hurst and first open by president woodrow wilson in 1914 this be a young and grow university but it have already fulfil bishop hurst 's enlightened hope for the study of history and public affair in a city devote to the making of history and to the conduct of the public 's business by sponsor this institution of high learning for all who wish to learn whatever their color or their creed the methodists of this area and the nation deserve the nation 's thank and i commend all those who be today graduate
 professor woodrow wilson once say that every man send out from a university should be a man of his nation as well as a man of his time and i be confident that the man and woman who carry the honor of graduate from this institution will continue to give from their life from their talent a high measure of public service and public support
 there be few earthly thing more beautiful than a university write john masefield in his tribute to english university and his word be equally true today he do not refer to spire and tower to campus green and ivied wall he admire the splendid beauty of the university he say because it be a place where those who hate ignorance may strive to know where those who perceive truth may strive to make other see
 i have therefore choose this time and this place to discuss a topic on which ignorance too often abound and the truth be too rarely perceive yet it be the most important topic on earth world peace
 what kind of peace do i mean what kind of peace do we seek not a pax americana enforce on the world by american weapon of war not the peace of the grave or the security of the slave i be talk about genuine peace the kind of peace that make life on earth worth living the kind that enable man and nation to grow and to hope and to build a well life for their child not merely peace for americans but peace for all man and woman not merely peace in our time but peace for all time
 i speak of peace because of the new face of war total war make no sense in an age when great power can maintain large and relatively invulnerable nuclear force and refuse to surrender without resort to those force it make no sense in an age when a single nuclear weapon contain almost ten time the explosive force deliver by all of the ally air force in the second world war it make no sense in an age when the deadly poison produce by a nuclear exchange would be carry by wind and water and soil and seed to the far corner of the globe and to generation yet unborn
 today the expenditure of billion of dollar every year on weapon acquire for the purpose of make sure we never need to use they be essential to keep the peace but surely the acquisition of such idle stockpile which can only destroy and never create be not the only much less the most efficient mean of assure peace
 i speak of peace therefore as the necessary rational end of rational man i realize that the pursuit of peace be not as dramatic as the pursuit of war and frequently the word of the pursuer fall on deaf ear but we have no more urgent task
 some say that it be useless to speak of world peace or world law or world disarmament and that it will be useless until the leader of the soviet union adopt a more enlightened attitude i hope they do i believe we can help they do it but i also believe that we must reexamine our own attitude as individual and as a nation for our attitude be as essential as theirs and every graduate of this school every thoughtful citizen who despair of war and wish to bring peace should begin by look inward by examine his own attitude toward the possibility of peace toward the soviet union toward the course of the cold war and toward freedom and peace here at home
 first let we examine our attitude toward peace itself too many of we think it be impossible too many think it unreal but that be a dangerous defeatist belief it lead to the conclusion that war be inevitable that mankind be doom that we be grip by force we can not control
 we need not accept that view our problem be manmade therefore they can be solve by man and man can be as big as he want no problem of human destiny be beyond human being man 's reason and spirit have often solve the seemingly unsolvable and we believe they can do it again
 i be not refer to the absolute infinite concept of universal peace and good will of which some fantasy and fanatic dream i do not deny the value of hope and dream but we merely invite discouragement and incredulity by make that our only and immediate goal
 let we focus instead on a more practical more attainable peace base not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institution on a series of concrete action and effective agreement which be in the interest of all concern there be no single simple key to this peace no grand or magic formula to be adopt by one or two power genuine peace must be the product of many nation the sum of many act it must be dynamic not static change to meet the challenge of each new generation for peace be a process a way of solve problem
 with such a peace there will still be quarrel and conflict interest as there be within family and nation world peace like community peace do not require that each man love his neighbor it require only that they live together in mutual tolerance submit their dispute to a just and peaceful settlement and history teach we that enmity between nation as between individual do not last forever however fix our like and dislike may seem the tide of time and event will often bring surprising change in the relation between nation and neighbor
 so let we persevere peace need not be impracticable and war need not be inevitable by define our goal more clearly by make it seem more manageable and less remote we can help all people to see it to draw hope from it and to move irresistibly toward it
 second let we reexamine our attitude toward the soviet union it be discourage to think that their leader may actually believe what their propagandist write it be discourage to read a recent authoritative soviet text on military strategy and find on page after page wholly baseless and incredible claim such as the allegation that american imperialist circle be prepare to unleash different type of war that there be a very real threat of a preventive war be unleash by american imperialist against the soviet union and that the political aim of the american imperialist be to enslave economically and politically the european and other capitalist country and to achieve world domination by mean of aggressive war
 truly as it be write long ago the wicked flee when no man pursueth yet it be sad to read these soviet statement to realize the extent of the gulf between we but it be also a warning a warning to the american people not to fall into the same trap as the soviets not to see only a distorted and desperate view of the other side not to see conflict as inevitable accommodation as impossible and communication as nothing more than an exchange of threat
 no government or social system be so evil that its people must be consider as lack in virtue as americans we find communism profoundly repugnant as a negation of personal freedom and dignity but we can still hail the russian people for their many achievement in science and space in economic and industrial growth in culture and in act of courage
 among the many trait the people of our two country have in common none be strong than our mutual abhorrence of war almost unique among the major world power we have never be at war with each other and no nation in the history of battle ever suffer more than the soviet union suffer in the course of the second world war at least 20 million lose their life countless million of home and farm be burn or sack a third of the nation 's territory include nearly two third of its industrial base be turn into a wasteland a loss equivalent to the devastation of this country east of chicago
 today should total war ever break out again no matter how our two country would become the primary target it be an ironic but accurate fact that the two strong power be the two in the most danger of devastation all we have build all we have work for would be destroy in the first 24 hour and even in the cold war which bring burden and danger to so many country include this nation 's close ally our two country bear the heavy burden for we be both devote massive sum of money to weapon that could be well devoted to combat ignorance poverty and disease we be both catch up in a vicious and dangerous cycle in which suspicion on one side breed suspicion on the other and new weapon beget counter weapon
 in short both the united states and its ally and the soviet union and its ally have a mutually deep interest in a just and genuine peace and in halt the arm race agreement to this end be in the interest of the soviet union as well as ours and even the most hostile nation can be rely upon to accept and keep those treaty obligation and only those treaty obligation which be in their own interest
 so let we not be blind to our difference but let we also direct attention to our common interest and to the mean by which those difference can be resolve and if we can not end now our difference at least we can help make the world safe for diversity for in the final analysis our most basic common link be that we all inhabit this small planet we all breathe the same air we all cherish our child 's future and we be all mortal
 third let we reexamine our attitude toward the cold war remember that we be not engage in a debate seek to pile up debating point we be not here distribute blame or point the finger of judgment we must deal with the world as it be and not as it might have be have the history of the last 18 year be different
 we must therefore persevere in the search for peace in the hope that constructive change within the communist bloc might bring within reach solution which now seem beyond we we must conduct our affair in such a way that it become in the communists interest to agree on a genuine peace above all while defend our own vital interest nuclear power must avert those confrontation which bring an adversary to a choice of either a humiliating retreat or a nuclear war to adopt that kind of course in the nuclear age would be evidence only of the bankruptcy of our policy or of a collective death wish for the world
 to secure these end america 's weapon be nonprovocative carefully control design to deter and capable of selective use our military force be commit to peace and discipline in self restraint our diplomat be instruct to avoid unnecessary irritant and purely rhetorical hostility
 for we can seek a relaxation of tension without relax our guard and for our part we do not need to use threat to prove that we be resolute we do not need to jam foreign broadcast out of fear our faith will be erode we be unwilling to impose our system on any unwilling people but we be willing and able to engage in peaceful competition with any people on earth
 meanwhile we seek to strengthen the united nations to help solve its financial problem to make it a more effective instrument for peace to develop it into a genuine world security system a system capable of resolve dispute on the basis of law of insure the security of the large and the small and of create condition under which arm can finally be abolish
 at the same time we seek to keep peace inside the non communist world where many nation all of they our friend be divide over issue which weaken western unity which invite communist intervention or which threaten to erupt into war our effort in west new guinea in the congo in the middle east and in the indian subcontinent have be persistent and patient despite criticism from both side we have also try to set an example for other by seek to adjust small but significant difference with our own close neighbor in mexico and in canada
 speak of other nation i wish to make one point clear we be bind to many nation by alliance those alliance exist because our concern and theirs substantially overlap our commitment to defend western europe and west berlin for example stand undiminishe because of the identity of our vital interest the united states will make no deal with the soviet union at the expense of other nation and other people not merely because they be our partner but also because their interest and ours converge
 our interest converge however not only in defend the frontier of freedom but in pursue the path of peace it be our hope and the purpose of allied policy to convince the soviet union that she too should let each nation choose its own future so long as that choice do not interfere with the choice of other the communist drive to impose their political and economic system on other be the primary cause of world tension today for there can be no doubt that if all nation could refrain from interfere in the self determination of other the peace would be much more assured
 this will require a new effort to achieve world law a new context for world discussion it will require increase understanding between the soviets and ourselves and increase understanding will require increase contact and communication one step in this direction be the propose arrangement for a direct line between moscow and washington to avoid on each side the dangerous delay misunderstanding and misreading of the other 's action which might occur at a time of crisis
 we have also be talk in geneva about other first step measure of arm control design to limit the intensity of the arm race and to reduce the risk of accidental war our primary long range interest in geneva however be general and complete disarmament design to take place by stage permit parallel political development to build the new institution of peace which would take the place of arm the pursuit of disarmament have be an effort of this government since the 1920 's it have be urgently seek by the past three ado ministration and however dim the prospect may be today we intend to continue this effort to continue it in order that all country include our own can well grasp what the problem and possibility of disarmament be
 the one major area of these negotiation where the end be in sight yet where a fresh start be badly need be in a treaty to outlaw nuclear test the conclusion of such a treaty so near and yet so far would check the spiral arm race in one of its most dangerous area it would place the nuclear power in a position to deal more effectively with one of the great hazard which man face in 1963 the further spread of nuclear arm it would increase our security it would decrease the prospect of war surely this goal be sufficiently important to require our steady pursuit yield neither to the temptation to give up the whole effort nor the temptation to give up our insistence on vital and responsible safeguard
 i be take this opportunity therefore to announce two important decision in this regard
 first chairman khrushchev prime minister macmillan and i have agree that highlevel discussion will shortly begin in moscow look toward early agreement on a comprehensive test ban treaty our hope must be temper with the caution of history but with our hope go the hope of all mankind
 second to make clear our good faith and solemn conviction on the matter i now declare that the united states do not propose to conduct nuclear test in the atmosphere so long as other state do not do so we will not be the first to resume such a declaration be no substitute for a formal bind treaty but i hope it will help we achieve one nor would such a treaty be a substitute for disarmament but i hope it will help we achieve it
 finally my fellow americans let we examine our attitude toward peace and freedom here at home the quality and spirit of our own society must justify and support our effort abroad we must show it in the dedication of our own life as many of you who be graduate today will have a unique opportunity to do by serve without pay in the peace corps abroad or in the propose national service corps here at home
 but wherever we be we must all in our daily life live up to the age old faith that peace and freedom walk together in too many of our city today the peace be not secure because freedom be incomplete
 it be the responsibility of the executive branch at all level of government local state and national to provide and protect that freedom for all of our citizen by all mean within their authority it be the responsibility of the legislative branch at all level wherever that authority be not now adequate to make it adequate and it be the responsibility of all citizen in all section of this country to respect the right of all other and to respect the law of the land
 all this be not unrelated to world peace when a man 's way please the lord the scripture tell we he maketh even his enemy to be at peace with he and be not peace in the last analysis basically a matter of human right the right to live out our life without fear of devastation the right to breathe air as nature provide it the right of future generation to a healthy existence
 while we proceed to safeguard our national interest let we also safeguard human interest and the elimination of war and arm be clearly in the interest of both no treaty however much it may be to the advantage of all however tightly it may be word can provide absolute security against the risk of deception and evasion but it can if it be sufficiently effective in its enforcement and if it be sufficiently in the interest of its signer offer far more security and far few risk than an unabated uncontrolled unpredictable arm race
 the united states as the world know will never start a war we do not want a war we do not now expect a war this generation of americans have already have enough more than enough of war and hate and oppression we shall be prepare if other wish it we shall be alert to try to stop it but we shall also do our part to build a world of peace where the weak be safe and the strong be just we be not helpless before that task or hopeless of its success confident and unafraid we labor on not toward a strategy of annihilation but toward a strategy of peace

good evening my fellow citizen
 this afternoon follow a series of threat and defiant statement the presence of alabama national guardsmen be require on the university of alabama to carry out the final and unequivocal order of the united states district court of the northern district of alabama that order call for the admission of two clearly qualified young alabama resident who happen to have be bear negro
 that they be admit peacefully on the campus be due in good measure to the conduct of the student of the university of alabama who meet their responsibility in a constructive way
 i hope that every american regardless of where he live will stop and examine his conscience about this and other related incident this nation be found by man of many nation and background it be found on the principle that all man be create equal and that the right of every man be diminish when the right of one man be threaten
 today we be committed to a worldwide struggle to promote and protect the right of all who wish to be free and when americans be send to viet nam or west berlin we do not ask for white only it ought to be possible therefore for american student of any color to attend any public institution they select without have to be back up by troop
 it ought to be possible for american consumer of any color to receive equal service in place of public accommodation such as hotel and restaurant and theater and retail store without be force to resort to demonstration in the street and it ought to be possible for american citizen of any color to register and to vote in a free election without interference or fear of reprisal
 it ought to be possible in short for every american to enjoy the privilege of be american without regard to his race or his color in short every american ought to have the right to be treat as he would wish to be treat as one would wish his child to be treat but this be not the case
 the negro baby bear in america today regardless of the section of the nation in which he be bear have about one half as much chance of complete a high school as a white baby bear in the same place on the same day one third as much chance of complete college one third as much chance of become a professional man twice as much chance of become unemployed about one seventh as much chance of earn $ 10,000 a year a life expectancy which be 7 year short and the prospect of earn only half as much
 this be not a sectional issue difficulty over segregation and discrimination exist in every city in every state of the union produce in many city a rise tide of discontent that threaten the public safety nor be this a partisan issue in a time of domestic crisis man of good will and generosity should be able to unite regardless of party or politic this be not even a legal or legislative issue alone it be well to settle these matter in the court than on the street and new law be need at every level but law alone can not make man see right
 we be confront primarily with a moral issue it be as old as the scripture and be as clear as the american constitution
 the heart of the question be whether all americans be to be afford equal right and equal opportunity whether we be go to treat our fellow americans as we want to be treat if an american because his skin be dark can not eat lunch in a restaurant open to the public if he can not send his child to the good public school available if he can not vote for the public official who represent he if in short he can not enjoy the full and free life which all of we want then who among we would be content to have the color of his skin change and stand in his place who among we would then be content with the counsel of patience and delay
 one hundred year of delay have pass since president lincoln free the slave yet their heir their grandson be not fully free they be not yet free from the bond of injustice they be not yet free from social and economic oppression and this nation for all its hope and all its boast will not be fully free until all its citizen be free
 we preach freedom around the world and we mean it and we cherish our freedom here at home but be we to say to the world and much more importantly to each other that this be a land of the free except for the negro that we have no second class citizen except negro that we have no class or cast system no ghetto no master race except with respect to negroes
 now the time have come for this nation to fulfill its promise the event in birmingham and elsewhere have so increase the cry for equality that no city or state or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore they
 the fire of frustration and discord be burn in every city north and south where legal remedy be not at hand redress be seek in the street in demonstration parade and protest which create tension and threaten violence and threaten life
 we face therefore a moral crisis as a country and as a people it can not be meet by repressive police action it can not be leave to increase demonstration in the street it can not be quiet by token move or talk it be a time to act in the congress in your state and local legislative body and above all in all of our daily life
 it be not enough to pin the blame on other to say this be a problem of one section of the country or another or deplore the fact that we face a great change be at hand and our task our obligation be to make that revolution that change peaceful and constructive for all
 those who do nothing be invite shame as well as violence those who act boldly be recognize right as well as reality
 next week i shall ask the congress of the united states to act to make a commitment it have not fully make in this century to the proposition that race have no place in american life or law the federal judiciary have uphold that proposition in a series of forthright case the executive branch have adopt that proposition in the conduct of its affair include the employment of federal personnel the use of federal facility and the sale of federally finance housing
 but there be other necessary measure which only the congress can provide and they must be provide at this session the old code of equity law under which we live command for every wrong a remedy but in too many community in too many part of the country wrong be inflict on negro citizen and there be no remedy at law unless the congress act their only remedy be in the street
 i be therefore ask the congress to enact legislation give all americans the right to be serve in facility which be open to the public hotel restaurant theater retail store and similar establishment
 this seem to i to be an elementary right its denial be an arbitrary indignity that no american in 1963 should have to endure but many do
 i have recently meet with score of business leader urge they to take voluntary action to end this discrimination and i have be encourage by their response and in the last 2 week over 75 city have see progress make in desegregate these kind of facility but many be unwilling to act alone and for this reason nationwide legislation be need if we be to move this problem from the street to the court
 i be also ask congress to authorize the federal government to participate more fully in lawsuit design to end segregation in public education we have succeed in persuade many district to de segregate voluntarily dozen have admit negroes without violence today a negro be attend a state support institution in every one of our 50 states but the pace be very slow
 too many negro child enter segregate grade school at the time of the supreme court 's decision 9 year ago will enter segregated high school this fall having suffer a loss which can never be restore the lack of an adequate education deny the negro a chance to get a decent job
 the orderly implementation of the supreme court decision therefore can not be leave solely to those who may not have the economic resource to carry the legal action or who may be subject to harassment
 other feature will be also request include great protection for the right to vote but legislation i repeat can not solve this problem alone it must be solve in the home of every american in every community across our country
 in this respect i want to pay tribute to those citizen north and south who have be work in their community to make life well for all they be act not out of a sense of legal duty but out of a sense of human decency
 like our soldier and sailor in all part of the world they be meet freedom 's challenge on the firing line and i salute they for their honor and their courage
 my fellow americans this be a problem which face we all in every city of the north as well as the south today there be negroes unemployed two or three time as many compare to white inadequate in education move into the large city unable to find work young people particularly out of work without hope deny equal right deny the opportunity to eat at a restaurant or lunch counter or go to a movie theater deny the right to a decent education deny almost today the right to attend a state university even though qualified it seem to i that these be matter which concern we all not merely president or congressman or governors but every citizen of the united states
 this be one country it have become one country because all of we and all the people who come here have an equal chance to develop their talent
 we can not say to 10 percent of the population that you can not have that right that your child can not have the chance to develop whatever talent they have that the only way that they be go to get their right be to go into the street and demonstrate i think we owe they and we owe ourselves a well country than that
 therefore i be ask for your help in make it easy for we to move ahead and to provide the kind of equality of treatment which we would want ourselves to give a chance for every child to be educate to the limit of his talent
 as i have say before not every child have an equal talent or an equal ability or an equal motivation but they should have the equal right to develop their talent and their ability and their motivation to make something of themselves
 we have a right to expect that the negro community will be responsible will uphold the law but they have a right to expect that the law will be fair that the constitution will be color blind as justice harlan say at the turn of the century
 this be what we be talk about and this be a matter which concern this country and what it stand for and in meet it i ask the support of all our citizen
 thank you very much

good evening my fellow citizen
 i speak to you tonight in a spirit of hope eighteen year ago the advent of nuclear weapon change the course of the world as well as the war since that time all mankind have be struggle to escape from the darken prospect of mass destruction on earth in an age when both side have come to possess enough nuclear power to destroy the human race several time over the world of communism and the world of free choice have be catch up in a vicious circle of conflict ideology and interest each increase of tension have produce an increase of arm each increase of arm have produce an increase of tension
 in these year the united states and the soviet union have frequently communicate suspicion and warning to each other but very rarely hope our representative have meet at the summit and at the brink they have meet in washington and in moscow in geneva and at the united nations but too often these meeting have produce only darkness discord or disillusion
 yesterday a shaft of light cut into the darkness negotiation be conclude in moscow on a treaty to ban all nuclear test in the atmosphere in outer space and under water for the first time an agreement have be reach on bring the force of nuclear destruction under international control a goal first seek in 1946 when bernard baruch present a comprehensive control plan to the united nations
 that plan and many subsequent disarmament plan large and small have all be block by those oppose to international inspection a ban on nuclear test however require on the spot inspection only for underground test this nation now possess a variety of technique to detect the nuclear test of other nation which be conduct in the air or under water for such test produce unmistakable sign which our modern instrument can pick up
 the treaty initial yesterday therefore be a limited treaty which permit continue underground testing and prohibit only those test that we ourselves can police it require no control post no onsite inspection no international body
 we should also understand that it have other limit as well any nation which sign the treaty will have an opportunity to withdraw if it find that extraordinary event relate to the subject matter of the treaty have jeopardize its supreme interest and no nation 's right of self defense will in any way be impaired nor do this treaty mean an end to the threat of nuclear war it will not reduce nuclear stockpile it will not halt the production of nuclear weapon it will not restrict their use in time of war
 nevertheless this limited treaty will radically reduce the nuclear testing which would otherwise be conduct on both side it will prohibit the united states the united kingdom the soviet union and all other who sign it from engage in the atmospheric test which have so alarmed mankind and it offer to all the world a welcome sign of hope
 for this be not a unilateral moratorium but a specific and solemn legal obligation while it will not prevent this nation from test underground or from be ready to conduct atmospheric test if the act of other so require it give we a concrete opportunity to extend its coverage to other nation and later to other form of nuclear test
 this treaty be in part the product of western patience and vigilance we have make clear most recently in berlin and cuba our deep resolve to protect our security and our freedom against any form of aggression we have also make clear our steadfast determination to limit the arm race in three administration our soldier and diplomat have work together to this end always support by great britain prime minister macmillan join with president eisenhower in propose a limited test ban in 1959 and again with i in 1961 and 1962
 but the achievement of this goal be not a victory for one side it be a victory for mankind it reflect no concession either to or by the soviet union it reflect simply our common recognition of the danger in further testing
 this treaty be not the millennium it will not resolve all conflict or cause the communists to forego their ambition or eliminate the danger of war it will not reduce our need for arm or ally or program of assistance to other but it be an important first step a step towards peace a step towards reason a step away from war
 here be what this step can mean to you and to your child and your neighbor
 first this treaty can be a step towards reduce world tension and broad area of agreement the moscow talk have reach no agreement on any other subject nor be this treaty condition on any other matter under secretary harriman make it clear that any nonaggression arrangement across the division in europe would require full consultation with our ally and full attention to their interest he also make clear our strong preference for a more comprehensive treaty ban all test everywhere and our ultimate hope for general and complete disarmament the soviet government however be still unwilling to accept the inspection such goal require
 no one can predict with certainty therefore what further agreement if any can be build on the foundation of this one they could include control on preparation for surprise attack or on number and type of armament there could be further limitation on the spread of nuclear weapon the important point be that effort to seek new agreement will go forward
 but the difficulty of predict the next step be no reason to be reluctant about this step nuclear test ban negotiation have long be a symbol of east west disagreement if this treaty can also be a symbol if it can symbolize the end of one era and the beginning of another if both side can by this treaty gain confidence and experience in peaceful collaboration then this short and simple treaty may well become an historic mark in man 's age old pursuit of peace
 western policy have long be design to persuade the soviet union to renounce aggression direct or indirect so that their people and all people may live and let live in peace the unlimited testing of new weapon of war can not lead towards that end but this treaty if it can be follow by further progress can clearly move in that direction
 i do not say that a world without aggression or threat of war would be an easy world it will bring new problem new challenge from the communists new danger of relax our vigilance or of mistake their intent
 but those danger pale in comparison to those of the spiral arm race and a collision course towards war since the beginning of history war have be mankind 's constant companion it have be the rule not the exception even a nation as young and as peace love as our own have fight through eight war and three time in the last two year and a half i have be require to report to you as president that this nation and the soviet union stand on the verge of direct military confrontation in laos in berlin and in cuba
 a war today or tomorrow if it lead to nuclear war would not be like any war in history a full scale nuclear exchange last less than 60 minute with the weapon now in existence could wipe out more than 300 million americans europeans and russians as well as untold number elsewhere and the survivor as chairman khrushchev warn the communist chinese the survivor would envy the dead for they would inherit a world so devastate by explosion and poison and fire that today we can not even conceive of its horror so let we try to turn the world away from war let we make the most of this opportunity and every opportunity to reduce tension to slow down the perilous nuclear arm race and to check the world 's slide toward final annihilation
 second this treaty can be a step towards free the world from the fear and danger of radioactive fallout our own atmospheric test last year be conduct under condition which restrict such fallout to an absolute minimum but over the year the number and the yield of weapon test have rapidly increase and so have the radioactive hazard from such testing continue unrestricted testing by the nuclear power join in time by other nation which may be less adept in limit pollution will increasingly contaminate the air that all of we must breathe
 even then the number of child and grandchild with cancer in their bone with leukemia in their blood or with poison in their lung might seem statistically small to some in comparison with natural health hazard but this be not a natural health hazard and it be not a statistical issue the loss of even one human life or the malformation of even one baby who may be bear long after we be go should be of concern to we all our child and grandchild be not merely statistic toward which we can be indifferent
 nor do this affect the nuclear power alone these test befoul the air of all man and all nation the committed and the uncommitted alike without their knowledge and without their consent that be why the continuation of atmospheric testing cause so many country to regard all nuclear power as equally evil and we can hope that its prevention will enable those country to see the world more clearly while enable all the world to breathe more easily
 third this treaty can be a step toward prevent the spread of nuclear weapon to nation not now possess they during the next several year in addition to the four current nuclear power a small but significant number of nation will have the intellectual physical and financial resource to produce both nuclear weapon and the mean of deliver they in time it be estimate many other nation will have either this capacity or other way of obtain nuclear warhead even as missile can be commercially purchase today
 i ask you to stop and think for a moment what it would mean to have nuclear weapon in so many hand in the hand of country large and small stable and unstable responsible and irresponsible scatter throughout the world there would be no rest for anyone then no stability no real security and no chance of effective disarmament there would only be the increase chance of accidental war and an increase necessity for the great power to involve themselves in what otherwise would be local conflict
 if only one thermonuclear bomb be to be drop on any american russian or any other city whether it be launch by accident or design by a madman or by an enemy by a large nation or by a small from any corner of the world that one bomb could release more destructive power on the inhabitant of that one helpless city than all the bomb drop in the second world war
 neither the united states nor the soviet union nor the united kingdom nor france can look forward to that day with equanimity we have a great obligation all four nuclear power have a great obligation to use whatever time remain to prevent the spread of nuclear weapon to persuade other country not to test transfer acquire possess or produce such weapon
 this treaty can be the opening wedge in that campaign it provide that none of the party will assist other nation to test in the forbidden environment it open the door for further agreement on the control of nuclear weapon and it be open for all nation to sign for it be in the interest of all nation and already we have hear from a number of country who wish to join with we promptly
 fourth and finally this treaty can limit the nuclear arm race in way which on balance will strengthen our nation 's security far more than the continuation of unrestricted testing for in today 's world a nation 's security do not always increase as its arm increase when its adversary be do the same and unlimited competition in the testing and development of new type of destructive nuclear weapon will not make the world safe for either side under this limit treaty on the other hand the testing of other nation could never be sufficient to offset the ability of our strategic force to deter or survive a nuclear attack and to penetrate and destroy an aggressor 's homeland
 we have and under this treaty we will continue to have the nuclear strength that we need it be true that the soviets have test nuclear weapon of a yield high than that which we think to be necessary but the hundred megaton bomb of which they speak 2 year ago do not and will not change the balance of strategic power the united states have choose deliberately to concentrate on more mobile and more efficient weapon with low but entirely sufficient yield and our security be therefore not impair by the treaty i be discuss
 it be also true as mr. khrushchev would agree that nation can not afford in these matter to rely simply on the good faith of their adversary we have not therefore overlook the risk of secret violation there be at present a possibility that deep in outer space that hundred and thousand and million of mile away from the earth illegal test might go undetected but we already have the capability to construct a system of observation that would make such test almost impossible to conceal and we can decide at any time whether such a system be need in the light of the limited risk to we and the limited reward to other of violation attempt at that range for any test which might be conduct so far out in space which can not be conduct more easily and efficiently and legally underground would necessarily be of such a magnitude that they would be extremely difficult to conceal we can also employ new device to check on the testing of small weapon in the low atmosphere any violation moreover involve along with the risk of detection the end of the treaty and the worldwide consequence for the violator
 secret violation be possible and secret preparation for a sudden withdrawal be possible and thus our own vigilance and strength must be maintain as we remain ready to withdraw and to resume all form of testing if we must but it would be a mistake to assume that this treaty will be quickly break the gain of illegal testing be obviously slight compare to their cost and the hazard of discovery and the nation which have initial and will sign this treaty prefer it in my judgment to unrestricted testing as a matter of their own self interest for these nation too and all nation have a stake in limit the arm race in hold the spread of nuclear weapon and in breathe air that be not radioactive while it may be theoretically possible to demonstrate the risk inherent in any treaty and such risk in this treaty be small the far great risk to our security be the risk of unrestricted testing the risk of a nuclear arm race the risk of new nuclear power nuclear pollution and nuclear war
 this limited test ban in our most careful judgment be safe by far for the united states than an unlimited nuclear arm race for all these reason i be hopeful that this nation will promptly approve the limited test ban treaty there will of course be debate in the country and in the senate the constitution wisely require the advice and consent of the senate to all treaty and that consultation have already begin all this be as it should be a document which may mark an historic and constructive opportunity for the world deserve an historic and constructive debate
 it be my hope that all of you will take part in that debate for this treaty be for all of we it be particularly for our child and our grandchild and they have no lobby here in washington this debate will involve military scientific and political expert but it must be not leave to they alone the right and the responsibility be yours
 if we be to open new doorway to peace if we be to seize this rare opportunity for progress if we be to be as bold and farsighte in our control of weapon as we have be in their invention then let we now show all the world on this side of the wall and the other that a strong america also stand for peace there be no cause for complacency
 we have learn in time past that the spirit of one moment or place can be go in the next we have be disappoint more than once and we have no illusion now that there be shortcut on the road to peace at many point around the globe the communists be continue their effort to exploit weakness and poverty their concentration of nuclear and conventional arm must still be deter
 the familiar contest between choice and coercion the familiar place of danger and conflict be all still there in cuba in southeast asia in berlin and all around the globe still require all the strength and the vigilance that we can muster nothing could more greatly damage our cause than if we and our ally be to believe that peace have already be achieve and that our strength and unity be no long require
 but now for the first time in many year the path of peace may be open no one can be certain what the future will bring no one can say whether the time have come for an easing of the struggle but history and our own conscience will judge we harsh if we do not now make every effort to test our hope by action and this be the place to begin accord to the ancient chinese proverb a journey of a thousand mile must begin with a single step
 my fellow americans let we take that first step let we if we can step back from the shadow of war and seek out the way of peace and if that journey be a thousand mile or even more let history record that we in this land at this time take the first step
 thank you and good night

mr. president as one who have take some interest in the election of president i want to congratulate you on your election to this high office mr. secretary general delegate to the united nations lady and gentleman

 we meet again in the quest for peace

 twenty four month ago when i last have the honor of address this body the shadow of fear lie darkly across the world the freedom of west berlin be in immediate peril agreement on a neutral laos seem remote the mandate of the united nations in the congo be under fire the financial outlook for this organization be in doubt dag hammarskjold be dead the doctrine of troika be be press in his place and atmospheric nuclear test have be resume by the soviet union

 those be anxious day for mankind and some man wonder aloud whether this organization could survive but the 16th and 17th general assemblies achieve not only survival but progress rise to its responsibility the united nations help reduce the tension and help to hold back the darkness

 today the cloud have lift a little so that new ray of hope can break through the pressure on west berlin appear to be temporarily ease political unity in the congo have be largely restore a neutral coalition in laos while still in difficulty be at least in be the integrity of the united nations secretariat have be reaffirm a united nations decade of development be under way and for the first time in 17 year of effort a specific step have be take to limit the nuclear arm race

 i refer of course to the treaty to ban nuclear test in the atmosphere outer space and under water conclude by the soviet union the united kingdom and the united states and already sign by nearly 100 country it have be hail by people the world over who be thankful to be free from the fear of nuclear fallout and i be confident that on next tuesday at 10:30 o'clock in the morning it will receive the overwhelming endorsement of the senate of the united states

 the world have not escape from the darkness the long shadow of conflict and crisis envelop we still but we meet today in an atmosphere of rise hope and at a moment of comparative calm my presence here today be not a sign of crisis but of confidence i be not here to report on a new threat to the peace or new sign of war i have come to salute the united nations and to show the support of the american people for your daily deliberation

 for the value of this body 's work be not dependent on the existence of emergency nor can the winning of peace consist only of dramatic victory peace be a daily a weekly a monthly process gradually change opinion slowly erode old barrier quietly build new structure and however undramatic the pursuit of peace that pursuit must go on

 today we may have reach a pause in the cold war but that be not a last peace a test ban treaty be a milestone but it be not the millennium we have not be release from our obligation we have be give an opportunity and if we fail to make the most of this moment and this momentum if we convert our new find hope and understanding into new wall and weapon of hostility if this .pause in the cold war merely lead to its renewal and not to its end then the indictment of posterity will rightly point its finger at we all but if we can stretch this pause into a period of cooperation if both side can now gain new confidence and experience in concrete collaboration for peace if we can now be as bold and farsighte in the control of deadly weapon as we have be in their creation then surely this first small step can be the start of a long and fruitful journey

 the task of build the peace lie with the leader of every nation large and small for the great power have no monopoly on conflict or ambition the cold war be not the only expression of tension in this world and the nuclear race be not the only arm race even little war be dangerous in a nuclear world the long labor of peace be an undertaking for every nation and in this effort none of we can remain unaligned to this goal none can be uncommitted

 the reduction of global tension must not be an excuse for the narrow pursuit of self interest if the soviet union and the united states with all of their global interest and clash commitment of ideology and with nuclear weapon still aim at each other today can find area of common interest and agreement then surely other nation can do the same nation catch in regional conflict in racial issue or in the death throe of old colonialism chronic dispute which divert precious resource from the need of the people or drain the energy of both side serve the interest of no one and the badge of responsibility in the modern world be a willingness to seek peaceful solution

 it be never too early to try and it be never too late to talk and it be high time that many dispute on the agenda of this assembly be take off the debating schedule and place on the negotiating table

 the fact remain that the united states as a major nuclear power do have a special responsibility in the world it be in fact a threefold responsibility a responsibility to our own citizen a responsibility to the people of the whole world who be affect by our decision and to the next generation of humanity we believe the soviet union also have these special responsibility and that those responsibility require our two nation to concentrate less on our difference and more on the mean of resolve they peacefully for too long both of we have increase our military budget our nuclear stockpile and our capacity to destroy all life on this hemisphere human animal vegetable without any corresponding increase in our security

 our conflict to be sure be real our concept of the world be different no service be perform by fail to make clear our disagreement a central difference be the belief of the american people in self determination for all people

 we believe that the people of germany and berlin must be free to reunite their capital and their country

 we believe that the people of cuba must be free to secure the fruit of the revolution that have be betray from within and exploit from without

 in short we believe that all the world in eastern europe as well as western in southern africa as well as northern in old nation as well as new that people must be free to choose their own future without discrimination or dictation without coercion or subversion

 these be the basic difference between the soviet union and the united states and they can not be conceal so long as they exist they set limit to agreement and they forbid the relaxation of our vigilance our defense around the world will be maintain for the protection of freedom and our determination to safeguard that freedom will measure up to any threat or challenge

 but i would say to the leader of the soviet union and to their people that if either of our country be to be fully secure we need a much well weapon than the h bomb a weapon well than ballistic missile or nuclear submarine and that well weapon be peaceful cooperation

 we have in recent year agree on a limited test ban treaty on an emergency communication link between our capital on a statement of principle for disarmament on an increase in cultural exchange on cooperation in outer space on the peaceful exploration of the antarctic and on temper last year 's crisis over cuba

 i believe therefore that the soviet union and the united states together with their ally can achieve further agreement agreement which spring from our mutual interest in avoid mutual destruction

 there can be no doubt about the agenda of further step we must continue to seek agreement on measure which prevent war by accident or miscalculation we must continue to seek agreement on safeguard against surprise attack include observation post at key point we must continue to seek agreement on further measure to curb the nuclear arm race by control the transfer of nuclear weapon convert fissionable material to peaceful purpose and ban underground testing with adequate inspection and enforcement we must continue to seek agreement on a free flow of information and people from east to west and west to east

 we must continue to seek agreement encourage by yesterday 's affirmative response to this proposal by the soviet foreign minister on an arrangement to keep weapon of mass destruction out of outer space let we get our negotiator back to the negotiating table to work out a practicable arrangement to this end

 in these and other way let we move up the steep and difficult path toward comprehensive disarmament secure mutual confidence through mutual verification and build the institution of peace as we dismantle the engine of war we must not let failure to agree on all point delay agreement where agreement be possible and we must not put forward proposal for propaganda purpose

 finally in a field where the united states and the soviet union have a special capacity in the field of space there be room for new cooperation for further joint effort in the regulation and exploration of space i include among these possibility a joint expedition to the moon space offer no problem of sovereignty by resolution of this assembly the member of the united nations have foresworn any claim to territorial right in outer space or on celestial body and declare that international law and the united nations charter will apply why therefore should man 's first flight to the moon be a matter of national competition why should the united states and the soviet union in prepare for such expedition become involved in immense duplication of research construction and expenditure surely we should explore whether the scientist and astronaut of our two country indeed of all the world cannot work together in the conquest of space send some day in this decade to the moon not the respresentative of a single nation but the representative of all of our country

 all these and other new step toward peaceful cooperation may be possible most of they will require on our part full consultation with our ally for their interest be as much involve as our own and we will not make an agreement at their expense most of they will require long and careful negotiation and most of they will require a new approach to the cold war a desire not to bury one 's adversary but to compete in a host of peaceful arena in idea in production and ultimately in service to all mankind

 the contest will continue the contest between those who see a monolithic world and those who believe in diversity but it should be a contest in leadership and responsibility instead of destruction a contest in achievement instead of intimidation speak for the united states of america i welcome such a contest for we believe that truth be strong than error and that freedom be more enduring than coercion and in the contest for a well life all the world can be a winner

 the effort to improve the condition of man however be not a task for the few it be the task of all nation act alone act in group act in the united nations for plague and pestilence and plunder and pollution the hazard of nature and the hunger of child be the foe of every nation the earth the sea and the air be the concern of every nation and science technology and education can be the ally of every nation

 never before have man have such capacity to control his own environment to end thirst and hunger to conquer poverty and disease to banish illiteracy and massive human misery we have the power to make this the good generation of mankind in the history of the world or to make it the last

 the united states since the close of the war have send over $ 100 billion worth of assistance to nation seek economic viability and 2 year ago this week we form a peace corps to help interested nation meet the demand for train manpower other industrialized nation whose economy be rebuild not so long ago with some help from we be now in turn recognize their responsibility to the less developed nation

 the provision of development assistance by individual nation must go on but the united nations also must play a large role in help bring to all man the fruit of modern science and industry a united nations conference on this subject he;d early this year at geneva open new vista for the develop country next year a united nations conference on trade will consider the need of these nation for new market and more than four fifth of the entire united nations system can be find today mobilize the weapon of science and technology for the united nations decade of development

 but more can be do

 --a world center for health communication under the world health organization could warn of epidemic and the adverse effect of certain drug as well as transmit the result of new experiment and new discovery

 --regional research center could advance our common medical knowledge and train new scientist and doctor for new nation

 --a global system of satellite could provide communication and weather information for all corner of the earth

 --a worldwide program of conservation could protect the forest and wild game preserve now in danger of extinction for all time improve the marine harvest of food from our ocean and prevent the contamination of air and water by industrial as well as nuclear pollution

 --and finally a worldwide program of farm productivity and food distribution similar to our country 's food for peace program could now give every child the food he need

 but man do not live by bread alone and the member of this organization be commit by the charter to promote and respect human right those right be not respect when a buddhist priest be drive from his pagoda when a synagogue be shut down when a protestant church can not open a mission when a cardinal be force into hiding or when a crowded church service be bomb the united states of america be oppose to discrimination and persecution on ground of race and religion anywhere in the world include our own nation we be work to right the wrong of our own country

 through legislation and administrative action through moral and legal commitment this government have launch a determined effort to rid our nation of discrimination which have exist far too longin education in housing in transportation in employment in the civil service in recreation and in place of public accommodation and therefore in this or any other forum we do not hesitate to condemn racial or religious injustice whether committed or permit by friend or foe

 i know that some of you have experience discrimination in this country but i ask you to believe i when i tell you that this be not the wish of most americans that we share your regret and resentment and that we intend to end such practice for all time to come not only for our visitor but for our own citizen as well

 i hope that not only our nation but all other multiracial society will meet these standard of fairness and justice we be oppose to apartheid and all form of human oppression we do not advocate the right of black africans in order to drive out white africans our concern be the right of all man to equal protection under the law and since human right be indivisible this body can not stand aside when those right be abuse and neglect by any member state

 new effort be need if this assembly 's declaration of human rights now 15 year old be to have full meaning and new mean should be find for promote the free expression and trade of idea through travel and communication and through increase exchange of people and book and broadcast for as the world renounce the competition of weapon competition in idea must flourish and that competition must be as full and as fair as possible

 the united states delegation will be prepare to suggest to the united nations initiative in the pursuit of all the goal for this be an organization for peace and peace can not come without work and without progress

 the peacekeeping record of the united nations have be a proud one though its task be always formidable we be fortunate to have the skill of our distinguished secretary general and the brave effort of those who have be serve the cause of peace in the congo in the middle east in korea and kashmir in west new guinea and malaysia but what the united nations have do in the past be less important than the task for the future we can not take its peacekeeping machinery for grant that machinery must be soundly finance which it can not be if some member be allow to prevent it from meet its obligation by fail to meet their own the united nations must be support by all those who exercise their franchise here and its operation must be back to the end

 too often a project be undertake in the excitement of a crisis and then it begin to lose its appeal as the problem drag on and the bill pile up but we must have the steadfastness to see every enterprise through

 it be for example most important not to jeopardize the extraordinary united nations gain in the congo the nation which seek this organization 's help only 3 year ago have now ask the united nations presence to remain a little long i believe this assembly should do what be necessary to preserve the gain already make and to protect the new nation in its struggle for progress let we complete what we have start for no man who put his hand to the plow and look back as the scripture tell we no man who put his hand to the plow and look back be fit for the kingdom of god

 i also hope that the recent initiative of several member in prepare standby peace force for united nations call will encourage similar commitment by other this nation remain ready to provide logistic and other material support

 policing moreover be not enough without provision for pacific settlement we should increase the resort to special mission of factfinde and conciliation make great use of the international court of justice and accelerate the work of the international law commission

 the united nations can not survive as a static organization its obligation be increase as well as its size its charter must be change as well as its custom the author of that charter do not intend that it be freeze in perpetuity the science of weapon and war have make we all far more than 18 year ago in san francisco one world and one human race with one common destiny in such a world absolute -sovereignty no long assure we of absolute security the convention of peace must pull abreast and then ahead of the invention of war the united nations build on its success and learn from its failure must be develop into a genuine world security system

 but peace do not rest in charter and covenant alone it lie in the heart and mind of all people and if it be east out there then no act no pact no treaty no organization can hope to preserve it without the support and the wholehearte commitment of all people so let we not rest all our hope on parchment and on paper let we strive to build peace a desire for peace a willingness to work for peace in the heart and mind of all of our people i believe that we can i believe the problem of human destiny be not beyond the reach of human being

 two year ago i tell this body that the united states have propose and be willing to sign a limited test ban treaty today that treaty have be sign it will not put an end to war it will not remove basic conflict it will not secure freedom for all but it can be a lever and archimedes in explain the principle of the lever be say to have declare to his friend give i a place where i can stand and i shall move the world

 my fellow inhabitant of this planet let we take our stand here in this assembly of nation and let we see if we in our own time can move the world to a just and last peace

senator moss my old colleague in the united states senate your distinguished senator moss president mckay mr. brown secretary udall governor mr. rawlings lady and gentleman
 i appreciate your welcome and i be very proud to be back in this historic building and have an opportunity to say a few word on some matter which concern i as president and i hope concern you as citizen the fact be i take strength and hope in see this monument hear its story retold by ted moss and recall how this state be build and what it start with and what it have now
 of all the story of american pioneer and settler none be more inspiring than the mormon trail the quality of the founder of this community be the quality that we seek in america the quality which we like to feel this country have courage patience faith self reliance perseverance and above all an unflagging determination to see the right prevail
 i come on this trip to see the united states and i can assure you that there be nothing more encouraging for any of we who work in washington than to have a chance to fly across this united states and drive through it and see what a great country it be and come to understand somewhat well how this country have be able for so many year to carry so many burden in so many part of the world
 the primary reason for my trip be conservation and i include in conservation first our human resource and then our natural resource and i think this state can take perhaps its great pride and its great satisfaction for what it have do not in the field of the conservation and the development of natural resource but what you have do to educate your child this state have a high percentage per capita of population of its boy and girl who finish high school and then go to college
 of all the waste in the united states in the 1960 's none be bad than to have 8 or 9 million boy and girl who will drop out statistic tell we drop out of school before they have finish come into the labor market unprepared at the very time when machine be take the place of man and women—9 million of they we have a large minority of our population who have not even finish the sixth grade and here in this rich of all country the country which spread the doctrine of freedom and hope around the globe we permit our most valuable resource our young people their talent to be waste by leave their school
 so i think we have to save they i think we have to insist that our child be educate to the limit of their talent not just in your state or in massachusetts but all over the united states thomas jefferson and john adams who develop the northwest ordinance which put so much emphasis on education thomas jefferson once say that any nation which expect to be ignorant and free hope for what never be and never will be so i hope we can conserve this resource
 the other be the natural resource of our country particularly the land west of the 100th parallel where the rain come 15 or 20 inch a year this state know that the control of water be the secret of the development of the west and whether we use it for power or for irrigation or for whatever purpose no drop of water west of the 100th parallel should flow to the ocean without be use and to do that require the dedicated commitment of the people of the states of the west work with the people of all the united states who have such an important equity in the richness of this part of the country so that we must do also
 as theodore and franklin roosevelt and gifford pinchot do it in year past we must do it in the 1960 's and 1970 's we will triple the population of this country in the short space of 60 or 70 year and we want those who come after we to have the same rich inheritance that we find now in the united states this be the reason for the trip but it be not what i want to speak about tonight
 i want to speak about the responsibility that i feel the united states have not in this country but abroad and i see the close interrelationship between the strength of the united states here at home and the strength of the united states around the world there be one great natural development here in the united states which have have in its own way a great effect upon the position and influence and prestige of the united states almost than any other act we have do do you know what it be it be the tennessee valley nearly every leader of every new emerge country that come to the united states want to go to new york to washington and the tennessee valley because they want to see what we be able to do with the most poverty ride section of the united states in the short space of 30 year by the wise management of our resource
 what happen here in this country affect the security of the united states and the cause of freedom around the globe if this be a strong vital and vigorous society the cause of freedom will be strong and vital and vigorous
 i know that many of you in this state and other states sometimes wonder where we be go and why the united states should be so involved in so many affair in so many country all around the globe if our task on occasion seem hopeless if we despair of ever work our will on the other 94 percent of the world population then let we remember that the mormon of a century ago be a persecuted and prosecute minority harry from place to place the victim of violence and occasionally murder while today in the short space of 100 year their faith and work be know and respect the world around and their voice hear in the high council of this country
 as the mormons succeed so america can succeed if we will not give up or turn back i realize that the burden be heavy and i realize that there be a great temptation to urge that we relinquish they that we have enough to do here in the united states and we should not be so busy around the globe the fact of the matter be that we this generation of americans be the first generation of our country ever to be involve in affair around the globe from the ginning of this country from the day of washington until the second world war this country live an isolated existence through most of our history we be an unaligned country an uncommitted nation a neutralist nation we be by statute as well as by desire we have believe that we could live behind our two ocean in safety and prosperity in a comfortable distance from the rest of the world
 the end of isolation consequently mean a wrench with the very lifeblood the very spine of the nation yet as time pass we come to see that the end of isolation be not such a terrible error or evil after all we come to see that it be the inevitable result of growth the economic growth the military growth and the cultural growth of the united states no nation so powerful and so dynamic and as rich as our own could hope to live in isolation from other nation especially at a time when science and technology be make the world so small
 it take brigham young and his follower 108 day to go from winter quarters nebraska to the valley of the great salt lake it take 30 minute for a missile to go from one continent to another we do not seek to become a world power this position be thrust upon we by event but we become one just the same and i be proud that we do
 i can well understand the attraction of those early day each one of we have moment of longing for the past but two world war have clearly show we try as we may that we can not turn our back on the world outside if we do we jeopardize our economic well being we jeopardize our political stability we jeopardize our physical safety
 to turn away now be to abandon the world to those whose ambition be to destroy a free society to yield these burden up after having carry they for more than 20 year be to surrender the freedom of our country inevitably for without the united states the chance of freedom surviving let alone prevail around the globe be nonexistent
 americans have come a long way in accept in a short time the necessity of world involvement but the strain of this involvement remain and we find it all over the country i see it in the letter that come to my desk every day we find ourselves entangle with apparently unanswerable problem in unpronounceable place we discover that our enemy in one decade be our ally the next we find ourselves commit to government whose action we can not often approve assist society with principle very different from our own
 the burden of maintain an immense military establishment with one million americans serve outside our frontier of finance a far fling program of development assistance of conduct a complex and baffle diplomacy all weigh heavily upon we and cause some to counsel retreat
 the world be full of contradiction and confusion and our policy seem to have lose the black and white clarity of simple time when we remember the maine and go to war
 it be little wonder then in this confusion we look back to the old day with nostalgia it be little wonder that there be a desire in the country to go back to the time when our nation live alone it be little wonder that we increasingly want an end to entangle alliance an end to all help to foreign country a cessation of diplomatic relation with country or state whose principle we dislike that we get the united nations out of the united states and the united states out of the united nations and that we retreat to our own hemisphere or even within our own boundary to take refuge behind a wall of force
 this be an understandable effort to recover an old feeling of simplicity yet in world affair as in all other aspect of our life the day of the quiet past be go forever science and technology be irreversible we can not return to the day of the sailing schooner or the cover wagon even if we wish and if this nation be to survive and succeed in the real world of today we must acknowledge the reality of the world and it be those reality that i mention now
 we must first of all recognize that we can not remake the world simply by our own command when we can not even bring all of our own people into full citizenship without act of violence we can understand how much hard it be to control event beyond our border
 every nation have its own tradition its own value its own aspiration our assistance from time to time can help other nation preserve their independence and advance their growth but we can not remake they in our own image we can not enact their law nor can we operate their government or dictate our policy
 second we must recognize that every tion determine its policy in term of its own interest no nation george washington write be to be trust far than it be bind by its interest and no prudent statesman or politician will depart from it national interest be more powerful than ideology and the recent development within the communist empire show this very clearly friendship as palmerston say may rise or wane but interest endure
 the united states have rightly determine in the year since 1945 under three different administration that our interest our national security the interest of the united states of america be well serve by preserve and protect a world of diversity in which no one power or no one combination of power can threaten the security of the united states the reason that we move so far into the world be our fear that at the end of the war and particularly when china become communist that japan and germany would collapse and these two country which have so long serve as a barrier to the soviet advance and the russian advance before that would open up a wave of conquest of all of europe and all of asia and then the balance of power turn against we we would finally be isolate and ultimately destroy that be what we have be engage in for 18 year to prevent that happen to prevent any one monolithic power have sufficient force to destroy the united states
 for that reason we support the alliance in latin america for that reason we support nato to protect the security of western europe for that reason we join seato to protect the security of asia so that neither russia nor china could control europe and asia and if they could not control europe and asia then our security be assure this be what we have be involve in do and however dangerous and hazardous it may be and however close it may take we to the brink on occasion which it have and however tired we may get of our involvement with these government so far away we have one simple central theme of american foreign policy which all of we must recognize because it be a policy which we must continue to follow and that be to support the independence of nation so that one bloc can not gain sufficient power to finally overcome we there be no mistake the vital interest of the united states in what go on around the world therefore accept what george washington say here i realize that what george washington say about no intangling alliance have be end by science and technology and danger
 and third we must recognize that foreign policy in the modern world do not lend itself to easy simple black and white solution if we be to have diplomatic relation only with those country whose principle we approve of we would have relation with very few country in a very short time if we be to withdraw our assistance from all government who be run differently from our own we would relinquish half the world immediately to our adversary if we be to treat foreign policy as merely a medium for deliver self righteous sermon to supposedly inferior people we would give up all thought of world influence or world leadership
 for the purpose of foreign policy be not to provide an outlet for our own sentiment of hope or indignation it be to shape real event in a real world we can not adopt a policy which say that if something do not happen or other do not do exactly what we wish we will return to fortress america that be the policy in this change world of retreat not of strength
 more important to adopt a black or white all or nothing policy subordinate our interest to our irritation its actual consequence would be fatal to our security if we be to resign from the united nations break off with all country of whom we disapprove end foreign aid and assistance to those country in an attempt to keep they free call for the resumption of atmospheric nuclear testing and turn our back on the rest of mankind we would not only be abandon america 's influence in the world we would be invite a communist expansion which every communist power would so greatly welcome and all of the effort of so many americans for 18 year would be go with the wind our policy under those condition in this dangerous world would not have much deterrent effect in a world where nation determine to be free could no long count on the united states
 such a policy of retreat would be folly if we have our back to the wall it be surely even great folly at a time when more realistic more responsible more affirmative policy have work such spectacular resuit for the most striking thing about our world in 1963 be the extent to which the tide of history have begin to flow in the direction of freedom to renounce the world of freedom now to abandon those who share our commitment and retire into lonely and not so splendid isolation would be to give communism the one hope which in this twilight of disappointment for they might repair their division and rekindle their hope
 for after some gain in the fifty the communist offensive which claim to be ride the tide of historic inevitability have be thwart and turn back in recent month indeed the whole theory of historical inevitability the belief that all road must lead to communism soon or later have be shatter by the determination of those who believe that man and nation will pursue a variety of road that each nation will evolve accord to its own tradition and its own aspiration and that the world of the future will have room for a diversity of economic system political creed religious faith unite by the respect for other and loyalty to a world order
 those force of diversity which serve mr. washington 's national interest those force of diversity be in the ascendancy today even within the communist empire itself and our policy at this point should be to give the force of diversity as oppose to the force of uniformity which our adversary espouse every chance every possible support that be why our assistance program so much malign of assist country to maintain their freedom i believe be important
 this country have see all of the hardship and the grief that have come to we by the loss of one country in this hemisphere cuba how many other country must be lose if the united states decide to end the program that be help these people who be get poor every year who have none of the resource of this great country who look to we for help but on the other hand in case look to the communists for example
 that be why i think this program be important it be a means of assist those who want to be free and in the final analysis it serve the united states in a very real sense that be why the united nations be important not because it can solve all these problem in this imperfect world but it do give we a means in those great moment of crisis and in the last 21/2 year we have have at least three when the soviet union and the united states be almost face to face on a collision course it do give we a means of provide as it have in the congo as it now be on the border of the yemen as it most recently be in a report of the united nations at malaysia it do give a means to mobilize the opinion of the world to prevent an atomic disaster which would destroy we all wherever we might live
 that be why the test ban treaty be important as a first step perhaps to be disappoint perhaps to find ourselves ultimately set back but at least in 1963 the united states commit itself and the senate of the united states by an overwhelming vote to one chance to end the radiation and the possibility of burn
 it may be as i say that we may fail but anyone who bother to look at the true destructive power of the atom today and what we and the soviet union could do to each other and the world in an hour and in a day and to western europe i pass over yesterday the little big horn where general custer be slay a massacre which have live in history 400 or 500 man we be talk about 300 million man and woman m 24 hour
 i think it be wise to take a first step to lessen the possibility of that happen and that be why our diplomacy be important for the force make for diversity be to be find everywhere where people be even within the communist empire and it be our obligation to encourage those force wherever they may be find hard and discouraging question remain in viet nam in cuba in laos the congo all around the globe the ordeal of the emerge nation have just begin the control of nuclear weapon be still incomplete the area of potential friction the chance of collision still exist
 but in every one of these area the position of the united states i believe be happy and safe when history be go for we rather than when it be go against we and we have history go for we today but history be what man make it the future be what man make it
 we can not fulfill our vision and our commitment and our interest in a free and diverse future without uncease vigilance devotion and most of all perseverance a willingness to stay with it a willingness to do with fatigue a willingness not to accept easy answer but instead to maintain the burden as the people of this state have do for 100 year and as the united states must do the rest of this century until finally we live in a peaceful world
 therefore i think this country will continue its commitment to support the world of freedom for as we discharge that commitment we be heed the command which brigham young hear from the lord more than a century ago the command he convey to his follower go as pioneer to a land of peace
 thank you

mr. mccloy president plimpton mr. macleish distinguished guest lady and gentleman
 i be very honored to be here with you on this occasion which mean so much to this college and also mean so much to art and the progress of the united states this college be part of the united states it belong to it so do mr. frost in a large sense and therefore i be privileged to accept the invitation somewhat render to i in the same way that franklin roosevelt render his invitation to mr. macleish the invitation which i receive from mr. mccloy the power of the presidency be often describe its limitation should occasionally be remember and therefore when the chairman of our disarmament advisory committee who have labor so long and hard governor stevenson 's assistant during the very difficult day at the united nations during the cuban crisis a public servant of so many year ask or invite the president of the united states there be only one response so i be glad to be here
 amherst have have many soldier of the king since its first one and some of they be here today mr. mccloy who have long be a public servant jim reed who be the assistant secretary of the treasury president cole who be now our ambassador to chile mr. ramey who be a commissioner of the atomic energy commission dick reuter who be head of the food for peace these and score of other down through the year have recognize the obligation of the advantage which the graduation from a college such as this place upon they to serve not only their private interest but the public interest as well
 many year ago woodrow wilson say what good be a political party unless it be serve a great national purpose and what good be a private college or university unless it be serve a great national purpose the library be construct today this college itself all of this of course be not do merely to give this school 's graduate an advantage an economic advantage in the life struggle it do do that but in return for that in return for the great opportunity which society give the graduate of this and related school it seem to i incumbent upon this and other school graduate to recognize their responsibility to the public interest
 privilege be here and with privilege go responsibility and i think as your president say that it must be a source of satisfaction to you that this school 's graduate have recognize it i hope that the student who be here now will also recognize it in the future although amherst have be in the forefront of extend aid to needy and talented student private college take as a whole draw 50 percent of their student from the wealthy 10 percent of our nation and even state university and other public institution derive 25 percent of their student from this group in march 1962 person of 18 year or old who have not complete high school make up 46 percent of the total labor force and such person comprise 64 percent of those who be unemployed and in 1958 the low fifth of the family in the united states have 41/2 percent of the total personal income the high fifth 44 1/2 percent there be inherit wealth in this country and also inherit poverty and unless the graduate of this college and other college like it who be give a running start in life unless they be willing to put back into our society those talent the broad sympathy the understanding the compassion unless they be willing to put those quality back into the service of the great republic then obviously the presupposition upon which our democracy be base be bind to be fallible
 the problem which this country now face be staggering both at home and abroad we need the service in the great sense of every educate man or woman to find 10 million job in the next 21/2 year to govern our relation a country which live in isolation for 150 year and be now suddenly the leader of the free world to govern our relation with over 100 country to govern those relation with success so that the balance of power remain strong on the side of freedom to make it possible for americans of all different race and creed to live together in harmony to make it possible for a world to exist in diversity and freedom all this require the good of all of we
 therefore i be proud to come to this college whose graduate have recognize this obligation and to say to those who be now here that the need be endless and i be confident that you will respond
 robert frost say
 two road diverge in a wood and i
 i take the one less travel by
 and that have make all the difference
 i hope that road will not be the less travel by and i hope your commitment to the great republic 's interest in the year to come will be worthy of your long inheritance since your beginning
 this day devote to the memory of robert frost offer an opportunity for reflection which be prize by politician as well as by other and even by poet for robert frost be one of the granite figure of our time in america he be supremely two thing an artist and an american a nation reveal itself not only by the man it produce but also by the man it honor the man it remember
 in america our hero have customarily run to man of large accomplishment but today this college and country honor a man whose contribution be not to our size but to our spirit not to our political belief but to our insight not to our self esteem but to our self comprehension in honor robert frost we therefore can pay honor to the deep source of our national strength that strength take many form and the most obvious form be not always the most significant the man who create power make an indispensable contribution to the nation 's greatness but the man who question power make a contribution just as dispensable especially when that questioning be disintereste for they determine whether we use power or power use we
 our national strength matter but the spirit which inform and control our strength matter just as much this be the special significance of robert frost he bring an unsparing instinct for reality to bear on the platitude and piety of society his sense of the human tragedy fortify he against self deception and easy consolation i have be he write one acquaint with the night and because he know the midnight as well as the high noon because he understand the ordeal as well as the triumph of the human spirit he give his age strength with which to overcome despair at bottom he hold a deep faith in the spirit of man and it be hardly an accident that robert frost couple poetry and power for he see poetry as the mean of save power from itself when power lead man towards arrogance poetry remind he of his limitation when power narrow the area of man 's concern poetry remind he of the richness and diversity of his existence when power corrupt poetry cleanse for art establishe the basic human truth which must serve as the touchstone of our judgment
 the artist however faithful to his personal vision of reality become the last champion of the individual mind and sensibility against an intrusive society and an officious state the great artist be thus a solitary figure he have as frost say a lover 's quarrel with the world in pursue his perception of reality he must often sail against the current of his time this be not a popular role if robert frost be much honor during his lifetime it be because a good many prefer to ignore his dark truth yet in retrospect we see how the artist 's fidelity have strengthen the fibre of our national life
 if sometimes our great artist have be the most critical of our society it be because their sensitivity and their concern for justice which must motivate any true artist make he aware that our nation fail short of its high potential i see little of more importance to the future of our country and our civilization than full recognition of the place of the artist
 if art be to nourish the root of our culture society must set the artist free to follow his vision wherever it take he we must never forget that art be not a form of propaganda it be a form of truth and as mr. macleish once remark of poet there be nothing bad for our trade than to be in style in free society art be not a weapon and it do not belong to the sphere of polemic and ideology artist be not engineer of the soul it may be different elsewhere but democratic society in it the high duty of the writer the composer the artist be to remain true to himself and to let the chip fall where they may in serve his vision of the truth the artist well serve his nation and the nation which disdain the mission of art invite the fate of robert frost 's hire man the fate of have nothing to look backward to with pride and nothing to look forward to with hope
 i look forward to a great future for america a future in which our country will match its military strength with our moral restraint its wealth with our wisdom its power with our purpose i look forward to an america which will not be afraid of grace and beauty which will protect the beauty of our natural environment which will preserve the great old american house and square and park of our national past and which will build handsome and balanced city for our future
 i look forward to an america which will reward achievement in the art as we reward achievement in business or statecraft i look forward to an america which will steadily raise the standard of artistic accomplishment and which will steadily enlarge cultural opportunity for all of our citizen and i look forward to an america which command respect throughout the world not only for its strength but for its civilization as well and i look forward to a world which will be safe not only for democracy and diversity but also for personal distinction
 robert frost be often skeptical about project for human improvement yet i do not think he would disdain this hope as he write during the uncertain day of the second war
 take human nature altogether since time begin and it must be a little more in favor of man say a fraction of one percent at the very least our hold on the planet would not have so increase
 because of mr. frost 's life and work because of the life and work of this college our hold on this planet have increase

mr. speaker mr. president members of the house members of the senate my fellow americans
 all i have i would have give gladly not to be stand here today
 the great leader of our time have be strike down by the foul deed of our time today john fitzgerald kennedy live on in the immortal word and work that he leave behind he live on in the mind and memory of mankind he live on in the heart of his countryman
 no word be sad enough to express our sense of loss no word be strong enough to express our determination to continue the forward thrust of america that he begin
 the dream of conquer the vastness of space the dream of partnership across the atlantic and across the pacific as well the dream of a peace corps in less developed nation the dream of education for all of our child the dream of job for all who seek they and need they the dream of care for our elderly the dream of an all out attack on mental illness and above all the dream of equal right for all americans whatever their race or color these and other american dream have be vitalize by his drive and by his dedication
 and now the idea and the ideal which he so nobly represent must and will be translate into effective action
 under john kennedy 's leadership this nation have demonstrate that it have the courage to seek peace and it have the fortitude to risk war we have prove that we be a good and reliable friend to those who seek peace and freedom we have show that we can also be a formidable foe to those who reject the path of peace and those who seek to impose upon we or our ally the yoke of tyranny
 this nation will keep its commitment from south viet nam to west berlin we will be uncease in the search for peace resourceful in our pursuit of area of agreement even with those with whom we differ and generous and loyal to those who join with we in common cause
 in this age when there can be no loser in peace and no victor in war we must recognize the obligation to match national strength with national restraint we must be prepare at one and the same time for both the confrontation of power and the limitation of power we must be ready to defend the national interest and to negotiate the common interest this be the path that we shall continue to pursue those who test our courage will find it strong and those who seek our friendship will find it honorable we will demonstrate anew that the strong can be just in the use of strength and the just can be strong in the defense of justice
 and let all know we will extend no special privilege and impose no persecution we will carry on the fight against poverty and misery and disease and ignorance in other land and in our own
 we will serve all the nation not one section or one sector or one group but all americans these be the united states a united people with a united purpose
 our american unity do not depend upon unanimity we have difference but now as in the past we can derive from those difference strength not weakness wisdom not despair both as a people and a government we can unite upon a program a program which be wise and just enlightened and constructive
 for 32 year capitol hill have be my home i have share many moment of pride with you pride in the ability of the congress of the united states to act to meet any crisis to distill from our difference strong program of national action
 an assassin 's bullet have thrust upon i the awesome burden of the presidency i be here today to say i need your help i can not bear this burden alone i need the help of all americans and all america this nation have experience a profound shock and in this critical moment it be our duty your and mine as the government of the united states to do away with uncertainty and doubt and delay and to show that we be capable of decisive action that from the brutal loss of our leader we will derive not weakness but strength that we can and will act and act now
 from this chamber of representative government let all the world know and none misunderstand that i rededicate this government to the unswerve support of the united nations to the honorable and determined execution of our commitment to our ally to the maintenance of military strength second to none to the defense of the strength and the stability of the dollar to the expansion of our foreign trade to the reinforcement of our program of mutual assistance and cooperation in asia and africa and to our alliance for progress in this hemisphere
 on the 20th day of january in 1961 john f. kennedy tell his countryman that our national work would not be finish in the first thousand day nor in the life of this administration nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet but he say let we begin
 today in this moment of new resolve i would say to all my fellow americans let we continue
 this be our challenge not to hesitate not to pause not to turn about and linger over this evil moment but to continue on our course so that we may fulfill the destiny that history have set for we our most immediate task be here on this hill
 first no memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor president kennedy 's memory than the early possible passage of the civil right bill for which he fight so long we have talk long enough in this country about equal right we have talk for one hundred year or more it be time now to write the next chapter and to write it in the book of law
 i urge you again as i do in 1957 and again in 1960 to enact a civil right law so that we can move forward to eliminate from this nation every trace of discrimination and oppression that be base upon race or color there could be no great source of strength to this nation both at home and abroad
 and second no act of ours could more fittingly continue the work of president kennedy than the early passage of the tax bill for which he fight all this long year this be a bill design to increase our national income and federal revenue and to provide insurance against recession that bill if pass without delay mean more security for those now work more job for those now without they and more incentive for our economy
 in short this be no time for delay it be a time for action strong forward look action on the pende education bill to help bring the light of learn to every home and hamlet in america strong forward look action on youth employment opportunity strong forward look action on the pende foreign aid bill make clear that we be not forfeit our responsibility to this hemisphere or to the world nor erase executive flexibility in the conduct of our foreign affair and strong prompt and forward look action on the remain appropriation bill
 in this new spirit of action the congress can expect the full cooperation and support of the executive branch and in particular i pledge that the expenditure of your government will be administer with the utmost thrift and frugality i will insist that the government get a dollar 's value for a dollar spend the government will set an example of prudence and economy this do not mean that we will not meet out unfilled need or that we will not honor our commitment we will do both
 as one who have long serve in both houses of the congress i firmly believe in the independence and the integrity of the legislative branch and i promise you that i shall always respect this it be deep in the marrow of my bone with equal firmness i believe in the capacity and i believe in the ability of the congress despite the division of opinion which characterize our nation to act to act wisely to act vigorously to act speedily when the need arise
 the need be here the need be now i ask your help
 we meet in grief but let we also meet in renew dedication and renew vigor let we meet in action in tolerance and in mutual understanding john kennedy 's death command what his life convey that america must move forward the time have come for americans of all race and creed and political belief to understand and to respect one another so let we put an end to the teaching and the preaching of hate and evil and violence let we turn away from the fanatic of the far left and the far right from the apostle of bitterness and bigotry from those defiant of law and those who pour venom into our nation 's bloodstream
 i profoundly hope that the tragedy and the torment of these terrible day will bind we together in new fellowship make we one people in our hour of sorrow so let we here highly resolve that john fitzgerald kennedy do not live or die in vain and on this thanksgiving eve as we gather together to ask the lord 's blessing and give he our thank let we unite in those familiar and cherished word
 america america
 god shed his grace on thee
 and crown thy good
 with brotherhood
 from sea to shine sea

 but john f. kennedy be the author of new hope for mankind hope which be share by a whole new generation of leader in every continent and we must not let grief turn we away from that hope he never quarrel with the past he always look at the future and our task now be to work for the kind of future in which he so strongly believe

 i have come here today to make it unmistakably clear that the assassin 's bullet which take his life do not alter his nation 's purpose

 we be more than ever oppose to the doctrine of hate and violence in our own land and around the world

 we be more than ever commit to the rule of law in our own land and around the world

 we believe more than ever in the right of man all man of every color in our own land and around the world

 and more than ever we support the united nations as the good instrument yet devise to promote the peace of the world and to promote the well being of mankind

 i can tell you today as i tell you in 1958 when i come as majority leader of the united states senate to the first committee of this great tribunal that the full power and partnership of the united states be committed to our joint effort to eliminate war and the threat of war aggression and the danger of violence and to lift from all people everywhere the blight of disease and poverty and illiteracy

 i.

 like all human institution the united nations have not achieve the high of hope that some hold at its birth our understanding of how to live live with one another be still far behind our knowledge of how to destroy one another

 but as our problem have grow this organization have grow in number in authority in prestige and its member nation have grow with it in responsibility and in maturity

 we have see too much success to become obsess with failure

 the peace keep machinery of the united nations have work in the congo in the middle east and elsewhere

 the great transition from colonial rule to independence have be largely accomplish

 the decade of development have successfully begin

 the world arm race have be slow

 the struggle for human right have be gain new force

 and a start have be make in further mankind 's common interest in outer space in scientific exploration in communication in weather forecasting in ban the stationing of nuclear weapon and in establish principle of law

 i know that vast problem remain conflict between great power conflict between small neighbor disagreement over disarmament persistence of ancient wrong in the area of human right residual problem of colonialism and all the rest but man and nation work apart create these problem and man and nation work together must solve they

 they can solve they with the help of this organization when all member make it a workshop for constructive action and not a forum for abuse when all member seek its help in settle their own dispute as well as the dispute of other when all member meet their financial obligation to it and when all member recognize that no nation and no party and no single system can control the future of man

 ii

 when i enter the congress of the united states 27 year ago it be my very great privilege to work closely with president franklin delano roosevelt as a member of congress i work with he to bring about a profound but peaceful revolution that peaceful revolution bring help and hope to the one third of our nation that be then ill house ill clad and ill nourished

 in my travel on behalf of my country and president kennedy i have see too much of misery and despair in africa in asia in latin america i have see too often the ravage of hunger and tapeworm and tuberculosis and the scab and the scar on too many child who have too little health and no hope

 i think that you and i and our country and this organization can and must do something about these condition i be not speak here of a new way of life to be impose by any single nation i be speak of a high standard of living to be inspire by these united nations it will not be achieve through some hopeful resolution in this assembly but through a peaceful revolution in the world through a recommitment of all our member rich and poor and strong and weak whatever their location or their ideology to the basic principle of human welfare and of human dignity

 in this effort the united states will do its full share in addition to bilateral aid we have with great satisfaction assist in recent year in the emergence and the improvement of international developmental institution both within and without this organization

 we favor the steady improvement of collective machinery for help the less develop nation build modern society we favor an international aid program that be international in practice as well as purpose every nation must do its share all united nations and their member can do well we can act more often together we can build together a much well world

 iii

 the great of human problem and the great of our common task be to keep the peace and to save the future all that we have build in the wealth of nation and all that we plan to do toward a well life for all will be in vain if our foot should slip or our vision falter and our hope end in another worldwide war if there be one commitment more than any other that i would like to leave with you today it be my unswerve commitment to the keeping and to the strengthening of the peace peace be a journey of a thousand mile and it must be take one step at a time

 we know what we want

 the united states want to prevent the dissemination of nuclear weapon to nation not now possess they

 the united states want to press on with arm control and reduction

 the united states want to cooperate with all the member of this organization to conquer everywhere the ancient enemy of mankind hunger and disease and ignorance

 the united states want sanity and security and peace for all and above all

 president kennedy i be sure would regard as his good memorial the fact that in his

 3 year as president the world become a little safe and the way ahead become a little brighter to the protection and the enlargement of this new hope for peace i pledge my country and its government

 iv

mr. speaker mr. president member of the house and senate my fellow americans

 i will be brief for our time be necessarily short and our agenda be already long

 last year 's congressional session be the long in peacetime history with that foundation let we work together to make this year 's session the good in the nation 's history

 let this session of congress be know as the session which do more for civil right than the last hundred session combine as the session which enact the most far reach tax cut of our time as the session which declare all out war on human poverty and unemployment in these united states as the session which finally recognize the health need of all our old citizen as the session which reform our tangle transportation and transit policy as the session which achieve the most effective efficient foreign aid program ever and as the session which help to build more home more school more library and more hospital than any single session of congress in the history of our republic

 all this and more can and must be do it can be do by this summer and it can be do without any increase in spending in fact under the budget that i shall shortly submit it can be do with an actual reduction in federal expenditure and federal employment

 we have in 1964 a unique opportunity and obligation to prove the success of our system to disprove those cynic and critic at home and abroad who question our purpose and our competence

 if we fail if we fritter and fumble away our opportunity in needless senseless quarrel between democrats and republicans or between the house and the senate or between the south and north or between the congress and the administration then history will rightfully judge we harshly but if we succeed if we can achieve these goal by forge in this country a great sense of union then and only then can we take full satisfaction in the state of the union

 here in the congress you can demonstrate effective legislative leadership by discharge the public business with clarity and dispatch vote each important proposal up or vote it down but at least bring it to a fair and a final vote

 let we carry forward the plan and program of john fitzgerald kennedy not because of our sorrow or sympathy but because they be right

 in his memory today i especially ask all member of my own political faith in this election year to put your country ahead of your party and to always debate principle never debate personality

 for my part i pledge a progressive administration which be efficient and honest and frugal the budget to be submit to the congress shortly be in full accord with this pledge

 it will cut our deficit in half from $ 10 billion to $ 4,900 million it will be in proportion to our national output the small budget since 1951

 it will call for a substantial reduction in federal employment a feat accomplish only once before in the last 10 year while maintain the full strength of our combat defense it will call for the low number of civilian personnel in the department of defense since 1950

 it will call for total expenditure of $ 97,900 million compare to $ 98,400 million for the current year a reduction of more than $ 500 million it will call for new obligational authority of $ 103,800 million a reduction of more than $ 4 billion below last year 's request of $ 107,900 million

 but it be not a standstill budget for america can not afford to stand still our population be grow our economy be more complex our people 's need be expand

 but by close down obsolete installation by curtail less urgent program by cut back where cut back seem to be wise by insist on a dollar 's worth for a dollar spend i be able to recommend in this reduced budget the most federal support in history for education for health for retrain the unemployed and for help the economically and the physically handicapped

 this budget and this year 's legislative program be design to help each and every american citizen fulfill his basic hope his hope for a fair chance to make good his hope for fair play from the law his hope for a full time job on full time pay his hope for a decent home for his family in a decent community his hope for a good school for his child with good teacher and his hope for security when face with sickness or unemployment or old age

 unfortunately many americans live on the outskirt of hope some because of their poverty and some because of their color and all too many because of both our task be to help replace their despair with opportunity

 this administration today here and now declare unconditional war on poverty in america i urge this congress and all americans to join with i in that effort

 it will not be a short or easy struggle no single weapon or strategy will suffice but we shall not rest until that war be win the rich nation on earth can afford to win it we can not afford to lose it one thousand dollar invest in salvage an unemployable youth today can return $ 40,000 or more in his lifetime

 poverty be a national problem require improved national organization and support but this attack to be effective must also be organize at the state and the local level and must be support and direct by state and local effort

 for the war against poverty will not be win here in washington it must be win in the field in every private home in every public office from the courthouse to the white house

 the program i shall propose will emphasize this cooperative approach to help that one fifth of all american family with income too small to even meet their basic need

 our chief weapon in a more pinpoint attack will be well school and well health and well home and well training and well job opportunity to help more americans especially young americans escape from squalor and misery and unemployment roll where other citizen help to carry they

 very often a lack of job and money be not the cause of poverty but the symptom the cause may lie deeply in our failure to give our fellow citizen a fair chance to develop their own capacity in a lack of education and training in a lack of medical care and housing in a lack of decent community in which to live and bring up their child

 but whatever the cause our joint federal local effort must pursue poverty pursue it wherever it exist in city slum and small town in sharecropper shack or in migrant worker camp on indian reservations among white as well as negroes among the young as well as the aged in the boom town and in the depressed area

 our aim be not only to relieve the symptom of poverty but to cure it and above all to prevent it no single piece of legislation however be go to suffice

 we will launch a special effort in the chronically distressed area of appalachia

 we must expand our small but our successful area redevelopment program

 we must enact youth employment legislation to put jobless aimless hopeless youngster to work on useful project

 we must distribute more food to the needy through a broad food stamp program

 we must create a national service corps to help the economically handicapped of our own country as the peace corps now help those abroad

 we must modernize our unemployment insurance and establish a high level commission on automation if we have the brain power to invent these machine we have the brain power to make certain that they be a boon and not a bane to humanity

 we must extend the coverage of our minimum wage law to more than two million worker now lack this basic protection of purchase power

 we must by include special school aid fund as part of our education program improve the quality of teaching training and counseling in our hard hit area

 we must build more library in every area and more hospital and nursing home under the hill burton act and train more nurse to staff they

 we must provide hospital insurance for our old citizen finance by every worker and his employer under social security contribute no more than $ 1 a month during the employee 's work career to protect he in his old age in a dignified manner without cost to the treasury against the devastating hardship of prolonged or repeat illness

 we must as a part of a revise housing and urban renewal program give more help to those displace by slum clearance provide more housing for our poor and our elderly and seek as our ultimate goal in our free enterprise system a decent home for every american family

 we must help obtain more modern mass transit within our community as well as low cost transportation between they

 above all we must release $ 11 billion of tax reduction into the private spending stream to create new job and new market in every area of this land

 these program be obviously not for the poor or the underprivileged alone every american will benefit by the extension of social security to cover the hospital cost of their aged parent every american community will benefit from the construction or modernization of school library hospital and nursing home from the training of more nurse and from the improvement of urban renewal in public transit and every individual american taxpayer and every corporate taxpayer will benefit from the early possible passage of the pende tax bill from both the new investment it will bring and the new job that it will create

 that tax bill have be thoroughly discuss for a year now we need action the new budget clearly allow it our taxpayer surely deserve it our economy strongly demand it and every month of delay dilute its benefit in 1964 for consumption for investment and for employment

 for until the bill be sign its investment incentive can not be deem certain and the withholding rate can not be reduce and the most damaging and devastating thing you can do to any businessman in america be to keep he in doubt and to keep he guess on what our tax policy be and i say that we should now reduce to 14 percent instead of 15 percent our withholding rate

 i therefore urge the congress to take final action on this bill by the first of february if at all possible for however proud we may be of the unprecedented progress of our free enterprise economy over the last three year we should not and we can not permit it to pause

 in 1963 for the first time in history we cross the 70 million job mark but we will soon need more than 75 million job in 1963 our gross national product reach the $ 600 billion level—$100 billion high than when we take office but it easily could and it should be still $ 30 billion high today than it be

 wage and profit and family income be also at their high level in history but i would remind you that four million worker and 13 percent of our industrial capacity be still idle today

 we need a tax cut now to keep this country move

 for our goal be not merely to spread the work our goal be to create more job i believe the enactment of a 35 hour week would sharply increase cost would invite inflation would impair our ability to compete and merely share instead of create employment but i be equally opposed to the 45- or 50 hour week in those industry where consistently excessive use of overtime cause increase unemployment

 so therefore i recommend legislation authorize the creation of a tripartite industry committee to determine on an industry by industry basis as to where a high penalty rate for overtime would increase job opening without unduly increase cost and authorize the establishment of such high rate

 let i make one principle of this administration abundantly clear all of these increase opportunity in employment in education in housing and in every field must be open to americans of every color as far as the writ of federal law will run we must abolish not some but all racial discrimination for this be not merely an economic issue or a social political or international issue it be a moral issue and it must be meet by the passage this session of the bill now pende in the house

 all member of the public should have equal access to facility open to the public all member of the public should be equally eligible for federal benefit that be finance by the public all member of the public should have an equal chance to vote for public official and to send their child to good public school and to contribute their talent to the public good

 today americans of all race stand side by side in berlin and in vietnam they die side by side in korea surely they can work and eat and travel side by side in their own country

 we must also lift by legislation the bar of discrimination against those who seek entry into our country particularly those who have much need skill and those join their family

 in establish preference a nation that be build by the immigrant of all land can ask those who now seek admission what can you do for our country but we should not be ask in what country be you bear

 for our ultimate goal be a world without war a world make safe for diversity in which all man good and idea can freely move across every border and every boundary

 we must advance toward this goal in 1964 in at least 10 different way not as partisan but as patriot

 first we must maintain and our reduce defense budget will maintain that margin of military safety and superiority obtain through three year of steadily increase both the quality and the quantity of our strategic our conventional and our antiguerilla force in 1964 we will be well prepared than ever before to defend the cause of freedom whether it be threaten by outright aggression or by the infiltration practice by those in hanoi and havana who ship arm and man across international border to foment insurrection and we must continue to use that strength as john kennedy use it in the cuban crisis and for the test ban treaty to demonstrate both the futility of nuclear war and the possibility of last peace

 second we must take new step and we shall make new proposal at geneva toward the control and the eventual abolition of arm even in the absence of agreement we must not stockpile arm beyond our need or seek an excess of military power that could be provocative as well as wasteful

 it be in this spirit that in this fiscal year we be cut back our production of enriched uranium by 25 percent we be shut down four plutonium pile we be close many nonessential military installation and it be in this spirit that we today call on our adversary to do the same

 third we must make increase use of our food as an instrument of peace make it available by sale or trade or loan or donation to hungry people in all nation which tell we of their need and accept proper condition of distribution

 fourth we must assure our pre eminence in the peaceful exploration of outer space focus on an expedition to the moon in this decade in cooperation with other power if possible alone if necessary

 fifth we must expand world trade having recognize in the act of 1962 that we must buy as well as sell we now expect our trading partner to recognize that we must sell as well as buy we be willing to give they competitive access to our market ask only that they do the same for we

 sixth we must continue through such measure as the interest equalization tax as well as the cooperation of other nation our recent progress toward balance our international account

 this administration must and will preserve the present gold value of the dollar

 tenth and finally we must develop with our ally new mean of bridge the gap between the east and the west face danger boldly wherever danger exist but be equally bold in our search for new agreement which can enlarge the hope of all while violate the interest of none

 in short i would say to the congress that we must be constantly prepare for the bad and constantly act for the good we must be strong enough to win any war and we must be wise enough to prevent one

 we shall neither act as aggressor nor tolerate act of aggression we intend to bury no one and we do not intend to be bury

 we can fight if we must as we have fight before but we pray that we will never have to fight again

 my good friend and my fellow americans in these last seven sorrowful week we have learn anew that nothing be so enduring as faith and nothing be so degrading as hate

 john kennedy be a victim of hate but he be also a great builder of faith faith in our fellow americans whatever their creed or their color or their station in life faith in the future of man whatever his division and difference

 this faith be echo in all part of the world on every continent and in every land to which mrs. johnson and i travel we find faith and hope and love toward this land of america and toward our people

 so i ask you now in the congress and in the country to join with i in express and fulfil that faith in work for a nation a nation that be free from want and a world that be free from hate a world of peace and justice and freedom and abundance for our time and for all time to come



the president this past week the united states have demonstrate anew in at least eight different situation this nation 's determination to insure both peace and freedom in the wide possible area progress toward these end be frequently slow and rarely dramatic but it should be view in the perspective of history and not headline

 first we have be patiently continue our effort to resume relation with our neighbor in panama and to reconsider with they without precondition on either side all issue which threaten to divide we

 second we have be quietly work on the cyprus crisis with our friend to determine the most useful role that each of we can play in ease the present strain on the island

 seventh in view of the french recognition of red china we have be discuss with the free nation of asia the necessity of resist any further temptation to reward the peking regime for its defiance of world peace and order

 and finally we have witness and the whole world have witness with pleasure the remarkable success of our saturn rocket the most powerful rocket thrust know to man this rocket i be happy to say be first recommend by our committee in 1958 it be not our desire or in our interest to create an air of emergency about these or other event our work proceed both day and night quietly steadily i believe confidently and i think the american people have every reason to share in that confidence

 i have a few announcement to make in the defense area first i be gratify by the result from the letter to defense contractor 1 that i send out less than a month ago we have receive almost 800 reply to that letter the defense department have talk with many businessman directly this be go to be an important part of the effort which we believe be go to produce saving to the taxpayer of over $ 4 billion per year in fiscal 1967

 the saving to be effect by the department of defense the white house announce on january 27 would be the result of a vigorous program to shift from contract on a cost plus fix fee basis to fix price or incentive contract and of reduce the number of letter contract preliminary agreement under which contractor may start work before a price be agree on

 second i want to draw your attention today to the cost reduction section of the defense department budget statement which be release last week some figure in there should be of interest to every taxpayer next year 's defense budget the one just send up for fiscal 1965 include due to more efficient management of our defense $ 2 4/10 billion that be more than $ 10 for every man woman and child in our country that have come about because of more efficient management under mr. mcnamara and the man who serve with he

 that be money that be strictly save in the come fiscal year simply by follow more sensible and efficient procedure it be money save not by risk this country 's security not by cut our defense but by run the department on a sound and businesslike basis and with real unification i have see more unification present and achieve in the defense department than at any time since the department be create

 we be in fact constantly make improvement in our strategic missile arsenal we be improve the payload the accuracy the reliability of all of these weapon we be also add new weapon to our arsenal we be now complete development for example on three new and highly advanced weapon system

 i think you would like to hear something about this because you can take great pride in it first the first of these be the redeye for the first time our ground combat soldier will be able to fight back against a high performance enemy aircraft the redeye which he can fire from the shoulder like a rifle send a heat seek missile in pursuit of the enemy airplane with a very high probability of scoring once hit the airplane will go down redeye have be develop by the pomona division of general dynamics at pomona calif.

 second the shillelagh have successfully complete engineering test and be be release for production it be an antitank missile mount on a vehicle so light that we can parachute it into the battlefield and so accurate that it can destroy a tank at a range of several thousand yard

 and finally the navy have recently demonstrate the walleye a glide bomb to be launch from an airplane and guide to its target by television the bomb have a television camera which be focus through remote control by the pilot in the airplane once the pilot have focus the camera on the target the mechanism in the bomb take over watch the television screen inside the bomb and then guide it until it reach the target

 the walleye have be demonstrate and it have show amazing accuracy at a range of several mile it be be develop by the naval ordnance test station at china lake calif. where the now famous sidewinder missile be develop

 finally i confer at length yesterday with sargent shriver who have just return from a world trip and i have ask he to serve as special assistant to the president in the organization and the ado ministration of the war on poverty program which i announce in my state of the union message

 mr. shriver will continue to serve as director of the peace corps he will begin immediately to study the formulation and the execution of the concentrated assault on the cause and cure of poverty in the united states i expect to appoint a committee of the cabinet to serve in an advisory capacity with he a cabinet committee to be make up of the secretary of health education and welfare the secretary of labor the attorney general the various department that would be interior and agriculture that would be concern with our war on poverty

 mr. shriver be eminently qualified for this additional assignment as you know he be executive director of the joseph p. kennedy foundation he be president of the chicago school board he be a very successful businessman he be an organizer and director of the peace corps he have demonstrate outstanding quality of leadership and i be sure that we will find that in the organization and draft of the message as well as the administration of the poverty program if it be approve by congress we will find he an exceptionally well qualified employee

 now i would like to conclude by read a brief message that i have just send to general khanh in viet nam in which i say

 i be glad to know that we see eye to eye on the necessity of step up the pace of military operation against the viet cong i particularly appreciate your warm and immediate response to my message as convey by ambassador lodge and general harkins we shall continue to be available to help you to carry the war to the enemy and to increase the confidence of the vietnamese people in their government

 a couple of day ago i send general khanh a message urge he to step up the pace of military operation he immediately reply as i announce in my more formal statement and this be my personal longhand reply to the general

 now any question

 q. mr. president do you foresee a situation in the relatively near future where you might recommend or accept the admission of red china into the united nations

 the president no i do not

 q. mr. president sir i wonder what you think about a full time senate employee or an employee of any government agency who would get himself involve on off duty hour or in regular hour with consultant for defense contracting firm of the government with build motel get himself involve in deal with mortgage company that be interested in pende legislation and in visit the dominican republic and talk to they about buy u.s. fighter plane by way of sweden do you think this be the proper conduct for any government employee

 the president the senate committee be now make a study of the accuracy of some of the allegation that you have make they will in their wisdom determine the accuracy of those allegation and i be sure render proper judgment

 q. mr. president many of we be wonder why you would hold a news conference in a cramp little room such as this limit to about 90 newsman when you have facility available to accommodate all newsman such as at the state department

 the president i do not have an answer to that question of your i think that this would be ample to take care of your need i be sorry if you find yourself uncomfortable it be much more convenient to come here at the time that i could come and i be attempt to satisfy the newsman it be somewhat difficult to do sometimes but they want a news conference this week and i think this be the appropriate place and could be well handle here

 q. mr. president although it seem a little early as a result of the republican fund raise dinner on friday night they apparently consider it open season on you do you have any favorite opponent among the one mention prominently to run against you next term and do you think it will be a hand off pretty rough political type campaign between you and that opponent

 the president no i do not have any favorite opponent it be not my duty to select my opposition i think that the delegate to the republican convention will act wisely and select the good man that be available to they and so far as i be concern i hope to keep as free from politic as i can as long as i can because i think it be in the interest of the continuity and transition of this administration and the unity of the country to keep free from mudslinging and petty politic and get into any political battle

 i have ask the democrats to refrain from indulge in any personality if at all possible we will have debate about principle and we expect difference of opinion we do not want to suppress they or silence they but i find in the 8 year that i serve as democratic leader under president eisenhower that it be not necessary to sle mud or to indulge in personality and i hope that our democratic people will follow that course what the republicans do be a matter for they to determine in their wisdom

 q. mr. president you speak of view these foreign problem in the perspective of history rather than today 's headline look at the problem of viet nam that way how do you look what do you see down the road be this a situation that can be settle in a military way do you rule out any neutralization such as general de gaulle suggest or what be your general perspective on viet nam

 the president if we could have neutralization of both north viet nam and south viet nam i be sure that would be consider sympathetically but i see no indication of that at the moment i think that if we could expect the viet cong to let their neighbor live in peace we could take a much different attitude but as long as these raid be continue and people be attempt to envelop south viet nam i think that the present course we be conduct be the only answer to that course and i think that the operation should be step up there i see no sentiment favor neutralization of south viet nam alone and i think the course that we be follow be the most advisable one for freedom at this point

 q. mr. president can you give we some idea of how you expect to participate in the choice of your own running mate whether you will make your personal choice know to the convention and what some of the factor be that you would weigh in the selection

 the president i would think that it would be premature and somewhat presumptuous at this point for i to go into any detailed discussion on the selection of a vice president i think that if i be nominate by the convention select as their standard bearer my recommendation will likely be seek and if so i will be glad to give they and at that time i will cross that bridge i hope that i can act wisely and in the good interest of the american people

 q. mr. president have you have the opportunity yet to study and make a personal decision on the rather bitter debate dispute rather between secretary mcnamara and the joint atomic committee in the congress over the atomic power plant for the carrier

 the president no i feel that i have not go into the detail of the fight i be aware of the issue i concur in the judgment that secretary mcnamara have make i think that we be look far into the future and that those judgment be always susceptible to error but at this moment i would conclude that his decision have be a reasonable one and a fair one and one in which i agree

 q. mr. president a two part question on legislation how confident be you that your two main piece of legislation of top priority namely the tax cut and civil right be actually go ahead to become legislation that be satisfactory to you and secondly what be the piece of legislation beneath those that you consider of importance as well for instance be medical care virtually in the same order of priority

 the president the answer to your first question be that i think that in the 60 day that i have hold this office we have make great progress in legislation when i come into it we have go along down the road with our educational bill but we finally consummate they and i think we have the good educational congress in the history of the republic

 we have 5 or 6 appropriation bill out of 15 pass we conclude action on those during this period of time we have report the civil right bill from the rules committee and it be now be debate in the house i hope and i believe that it will be pass without any crippling amendment i think it should be pass without any crippling amendment i think that due progress be be make there i hope it be act upon in the house before the members leave to attend lincoln day birthday meeting throughout the nation because it would be a great tribute to president lincoln to have that bill finally act upon in the house before we go out to celebrate his birthday

 on the tax bill it have be before the congress now for almost 13 month the senate have report it the senate committee have report it to the senate it be be debate there there be some 180 odd technical amendment and there will be dozen of other amendment it will be carefully deliberate but i hope that we can pass it before we take a recess for lincoln 's birthday on february 12

 i be pleased with the progress make on both of those bill i hope the tax bill can withstand the onslaught that will be make by many in attempt to amend it in the next few day and then will go to conference and i would like to see it report from conference as nearly to the administration 's recommendation as possible because before those recommendation be submit to congress i participate in their formulation and embrace they

 now there be other important item we have a good many item in the national resource legislation field like the wilderness bill and other we have a good many measure we must pass in the agricultural field farm legislation which we consider very important we consider medical care a very important measure and i have already talk to the chairman of the ways and means committee about it i have talk to lead republicans who have a substitute plan that they have propose which i be now study and give some thought to try to determine the merit of it but i hope that we can pass a medicare bill out of the house ways and means committee and through the congress this year base on the social security principle i can think of no single piece of legislation that i would be happy to approve than that bill

 the housing legislation i could spend most of this time tell you how important i think it be it be one of the most comprehensive bill in the history of the nation i hope that we can work toward the goal of someday every american own his home i think that this message go in that direction i have review it carefully both at the ranch and here in washington with administrator weaver we will start hearing on it very shortly in both body it be extremely important

 i think that we have an administration program that be go to be difficult to enact before the convention but with cooperation from all people on both side of the aisle i hope we will attain a major part of it

 to your second question i would say that i do put medical care high on the priority list

 q. mr. president do general de gaulle 's proposal for neutralize southeast asia interfere with our objective there or make our work there more difficult than it would be otherwise

 the president yes i do not agree with general de gaulle 's proposal i do not think that it would be in the interest of freedom to share his view general de gaulle be entitle to his opinion he have express it we have express our we think the course of action that we be follow in southeast asia be the only course for we to follow and the most advisable at this time we plan to pursue it diligently and we hope successfully on a step up basis

 q. mr. president two day ago when prime minister pearson of canada be in washington he express the position that before long russia would agree to a total nuclear test ban to include underground test do you share this optimism and also be you optimistic that some meaningful disarmament agreement will come out of the present geneva conference

 the president i would rather not express it in term of optimism or pessimism i would rather say that it should be the goal of every leader in the world today to try to find area of agreement that will lead to disarmament we be seriously dedicatedly do our very good and try to initiate and develop every conceivable fresh proposal we can that will lead to that end

 q. mr. president do you anticipate a filibuster when the civil right bill eventually reach the senate do you think in order to pass it in the senate the bill will have to be substantially trim

 the president no i do not think it will have to be substantially trim and yes i do expect a filibuster

 q. mr. president thursday in the rules committee an amendment be offer to include woman in the ban on discrimination in the civil right bill on the basis of race religion or national origin that be defeat by one vote and will be bring up again on the floor of the house

 now in the democratic platform it say and if i may read you just a few words-"we support legislation which will guarantee to woman equality of right under the law

 would you support an amendment to include woman in the civil right bill

 the president i support that platform and embrace that platform and state that view in 43 state in the union i realize there have be discrimination in the employment of woman and i be do my good to do something about it i be hopeful that in the next month we will have make substantial advance in that field

 q. mr. president do you feel that mr. walter jenkins should go up to the capitol and testify under oath to clear up the conflict that be appear in the testimony

 the president the general question be raise with i at my last meeting i speak with candor and frankness on that subject about all i know about it i say then that i do not plan to make any more statement on it and i do not

 q. mr. president could you elaborate sir on your statement that you might look with some sympathy on the neutralization of both south viet nam and north viet nam how do this differ from president de gaulle 's idea

 the president well you will have to ask general de gaulle about the detail of his proposal but as i understand it the neutralization talk have apply only to south viet nam and not to the whole of that area of the world i think that the only thing we need to do to have complete peace in that area of the world now be to stop the invasion of south viet nam by some of its neighbor and supporter

 q. mr. president some of your adviser have different view as to the proper strategy to follow in the war on poverty some think the program should emphasize a welfare aspect some think an education aspect some think job creation which of those three general area do you think the program should focus on

 the president on all three of they and i be unaware of any difference among my adviser in that field we have a group from the cabinet that have give considerable attention to that and we be now develop recommendation those recommendation will be contain in a message

 but my answer to your question be first i know of no disagreement among my adviser two i think the message will emphasize all three area that message be be very carefully work out and will be coordinate with all of the adviser who have responsibility in those field we expect to get through the regular appropriation bill in excess of a half billion dollar to be coordinate into the poverty program so that it will be essential that we have the cooperation of all the cabinet department to whom the money be appropriate

 thank you mr. president





mr. president mr. chancellor president adolfo lopez mateos and mrs. mateos senator kuchel members of congress distinguished guest lady and gentleman

 it be altogether appropriate that in this place of learn we should honor president lopez mateos his quality of mind and heart have make he the leader of mexico and an example of the hemisphere a product of revolution and an architect of freedom the university and institute of his own country be attract young man and woman from every continent and this be testimony to the vigor of mexican intellectual and scientific achievement

 like other great college and university in this country the university of california be deeply committed to the enrichment and the diversity of american life this university have its own cherish link with mexico and just as i be proud to claim adolfo lopez mateos as my personal friend the people of the united states as governor brown have tell you be proud of their endure friendship with our neighboring nation mexico

 in the winning of our independence in the strengthening of our institution in the relentless quest of social justice and human right in the pursuit of a well way of life for all of our people mexico and the united states have walk a common road other walk that road today and our experience mr. president enable we to understand their hope for neither mexico nor the united states leap into the modern world full grown we be both the product of inspire man who build new liberty out of old oppression and mr. president neither of our revolution be yet finish

 so long as there remain a man without a job a family without a roof a child without a school we have much to do no american can rest while any american be deny his right because of the color of his skin no american conscience can be at peace while any american be jobless hungry uneducated and ignore

 our permanent revolution be dedicate so broaden for all americans the material and the spiritual benefit of the democratic heritage but while we pursue these unfinished task at home we must look also at the large scene of world affair our constant aim our steadfast purpose our undeviating policy be to do all that strengthen the hope of peace and nothing will ever make we weary in these task in our foreign policy today there be room neither for complacency nor for alarm the world have become small and turbulent new challenge knock daily at the white house america 's front door

 in south viet nam terror and violence direct and supply by outside enemy press against the life and the liberty of a people who seek only to be leave in peace for 10 year our country have be commit to the support of their freedom and that commitment we will continue to honor the contest in which south viet nam be now engage be first and foremost a contest to be win by the government and the people of that country for themselves but those engage in external direction and supply would do well to be remind and to remember that this type of aggression be a deeply dangerous game

 for every american it be a source of sadness that the two community in cyprus be today set against each other america 's partnership with europe begin with president truman 's brave pledge of assistance to greece and turkey now the people of cyprus closely tie to these two friend and ally our partner in nato stand at the edge of tragedy of course the united states though not a party to the issue will do everything we possibly can to find a solution a peaceful solution so i appeal for an end to the bloodshed before it be too late to everyone in cyprus and to all interested party around the world it be the task of statesmanship to prevent the danger in cyprus from explode into disaster

 close to home we ourselves seek a settlement with our friend in panama we give assurance to the government and to the people of panama that the united states of america be determined to be absolutely fair in all discussion on all our problem we be prepare calmly and without pressure to consider all the problem which exist between we and to try our dead level good to find a solution to they promptly what be need now be a covenant of cooperation

 as we be patient in panama we be prepare at guantanamo we have deal with the late challenge and provocation from havana without send the marines to turn on a water faucet we believe it far wise to send an admiral to cut the water off than to send a battalion of marines to turn it back on we be make our base more secure than it have ever be in its history

 i have choose today to speak of the danger of today if we be to solve they all tomorrow then there will be more next week but the weather vane of headline be not the signpost of history large than the trouble i have note be the spread civil war among the communists and large still be the steadily grow strength of the worldwide community of freedom the power of the free community have never be great on the tactic of the day we sometimes differ with the good of our friend but in our commitment to freedom we be united here in north america for example we speak in english in spanish and in french and all be the tongue of liberty

 here in this hemisphere as we work together on the great opportunity for the alliance for progress we can surely join in extend a warm welcome to friend in europe who offer help in our progress and market for our product we seek a grow partnership with all our friend and we will never retreat from our obligation to any ally nor will we ever be intimidate by any state anywhere at any time in the world that choose to make itself our adversary there be no panic on our agenda we be interested in the deed of our adversary and not their creed let they offer deed of peace and our response will be swift

 so let we go forward with undaunted purpose in the healing of the nation for america today as in jefferson 's time peace must be our passion it be not enough for america to be a sentinel on the frontier of freedom america must also be on the watchtower seek out the horizon of peace we be not alone as servant and guardian of these high cause yet on we as a people and government have fall a solemn burden we shall never weary under its weight so let we with brave heart and with cool head advance with the task of build the citadel of peace in a world that be set free from fear

 the president i do not handle my own security i be inform that there have be reason for take additional precaution and i ask that the matter be carefully examine and handle entirely by mr. j. edgar hoover and the secret service both of whom work closely together in connection with the president 's security and we follow the suggestion outline none of which i be familiar with in detail

 q. mr. president how do you appraise the possible political impact of the bobby baker case

 the president i think that be a matter that the senate be consider they have witness to be hear the senate will make its report and take such action as they feel be justify and i be sure they will take the proper action we will have to see what the consequence be follow their recommendation when all of the evidence be in

 q. mr. president sir could you bring we up to date on the conflict in south viet nam and north viet nam and whether or not you think that this conflict will be expand and sir be we lose there

 the president we have ask secretary mcnamara who have make periodic visit to saigon to go to viet nam in the next few day he will go there and have his conference and will bring back very valuable information we have a very difficult situation in viet nam we be furnish advice and counsel and training to the south viet nam army and we must rely on they for such action as be take to defend themselves

 we think that mr. mcnamara will correctly appraise the situation on this trip and make such recommendation as he deem appropriate i do not think that the speculation that have be make that we should enter into a neutralization of that area or that we be lose the fight in that area or that thing have go to pot there be at all justify i think that they do our cause a great disservice but we be keep in close touch with it daily

 we have ambassador lodge who head our force in that area he be in constant communication with we he make recommendation from time to time we act promptly on those recommendation we feel that we be follow the proper course and that our national interest be be fully protect

 q. mr. president do you see any reason to fear that an extension of the fighting in south viet nam might bring communist china or even the soviet union into the fight

 the president i know of no good purpose that would be serve by speculate on the military strategy of the force of the south vietnamese i think that too much speculation have already take place i think that a good deal of it without justification i sometimes wonder if general eisenhower before the battle of normandy have be confront with all the if the world have all the information concern his plan that they seem to have concern our in viet nam what would have happen on that fateful day

 so i would answer your question merely by say that i do not care to speculate on what might happen the plan that have be discuss in the paper be not plan that have come to my attention or that i have approve

 q. mr. president henry cabot lodge your ambassador to south viet nam be your opponent for the vice presidency in 1960 and be a very strong potential republican nominee this time do not that make conduct of your policy in south viet nam awkward if not difficult

 the president no i do not think so mr. lodge have a brilliant career in the senate he serve in the united states army after resign from the senate he have considerable military experience there he serve his country well at the united nations under the administration of president eisenhower he be select by president kennedy upon the recommendation of secretary rusk he have be give full authority to act as our top adviser in that area he have a long conference with i before he return to viet nam in november

 i be unaware of any political inclination he may have i have see nothing that he have do that have in any way interfere with his work out there i think that he have properly assess the situation himself by say that since he be our ambassador there he can not personally get involve in the campaign plan that some of his friend may have for he

 q. mr. president do you see any hope of reach an agreement in panama before that country 's presidential election in may

 the president i would hope that we could reach an agreement as early as possible as soon as i learn that the panamanians have march on our zone and we have a disturbance there and some of our soldier have be kill some of the student have raise the flag and this disturbance have result i immediately call the president of panama on the telephone and say to he in that first exchange i want to do everything i can to work this problem out peacefully and quickly therefore our people will meet with your people any time anywhere to discuss anything that will result in bring peace and stop violence

 the president ask i how long it would be before those discussion could take place and i say we would have a team in the air within 30 minute

 i designate assistant secretary mann to leave immediately we have be pursue those discussion ever since we have reach no agreement one day you see speculation that an agreement be imminent the next day you see speculation that we be very pessimistic i think both report have be wrong

 there have be no meeting of the mind we realize that treaty be write in 1903

 and modify from time to time that problem be involve that need to be deal with and perhaps would require adjustment in the treaty in 1963 or 1964

 so we be not refuse to discuss and evolve a program that will be fair and just to all concern but we be not go to make any precommitment before we sit down on what we be go to do in the way of rewrite new treaty with a nation that we do not have diplomatic relation with once those relation be restore we will be glad as i say the first day and as we have repeat every day since to discuss anything any time anywhere and do what be just and what be fair and what be right just because panama happen to be a small nation maybe no large than the city of st. louis be no reason why we should not try in every way to be equitable and fair and just we be go to insist on that but we be go to be equally insistent on no precondition

 it be go to be the course of this government to do everything that we can to resolve these difference peacefully even though they be not of our own making there be few of these situation which have be bring about by anything that we have do but they be age old difference that have exist for century

 i be an optimist i spend 35 day in meeting with the security council in the cuban missile crisis i see the alternative present there i realize that we can with the great power we have perhaps destroy 100 million people in a matter of minute and our adversary can do likewise

 we think that mr. mcnamara will correctly appraise the situation on this trip and make such recommendation as he deem appropriate i do not think that the speculation that have be make that we should enter into a neutralization of that area or that we be lose the fight in that area or that thing have go to pot there be at all justify i think that they do our cause a great disservice but we be keep in close touch with it daily

 we have ambassador lodge who head our force in that area he be in constant communication with we he make recommendation from time to time we act promptly on those recommendation we feel that we be follow the proper course and that our national interest be be fully protect

 q. mr. president do you see any reason to fear that an extension of the fighting in south viet nam might bring communist china or even the soviet union into the fight

 the president i know of no good purpose that would be serve by speculate on the military strategy of the force of the south vietnamese i think that too much speculation have already take place i think that a good deal of it without justification i sometimes wonder if general eisenhower before the battle of normandy have be confront with all the if the world have all the information concern his plan that they seem to have concern our in viet nam what would have happen on that fateful day

 i be unaware of any political inclination he may have i have see nothing that he have do that have in any way interfere with his work out there i think that he have properly assess the situation himself by say that since he be our ambassador there he can not personally get involve in the campaign plan that some of his friend may have for he

 q. mr. president do you see any hope of reach an agreement in panama before that country 's presidential election in may

 the president ask i how long it would be before those discussion could take place and i say we would have a team in the air within 30 minute

 i designate assistant secretary mann to leave immediately we have be pursue those discussion ever since we have reach no agreement one day you see speculation that an agreement be imminent the next day you see speculation that we be very pessimistic i think both report have be wrong

 there have be no meeting of the mind we realize that treaty be write in 1903

 and modify from time to time that problem be involve that need to be deal with and perhaps would require adjustment in the treaty in 1963 or 1964

 so we be not refuse to discuss and evolve a program that will be fair and just to all concern but we be not go to make any precommitment before we sit down on what we be go to do in the way of rewrite new treaty with a nation that we do not have diplomatic relation with once those relation be restore we will be glad as i say the first day and as we have repeat every day since to discuss anything any time anywhere and do what be just and what be fair and what be right just because panama happen to be a small nation maybe no large than the city of st. louis be no reason why we should not try in every way to be equitable and fair and just we be go to insist on that but we be go to be equally insistent on no precondition

 the president that be a matter that be be study by the senate committee at this time i would not make such a recommendation i think the senate committee will hear from all who be interested in the subject and after due deliberation make their recommendation

 a constitutional amendment would not be something the president would pass upon i have individual view on it but at this time i think it be a matter that more appropriately should be consider by the subcommittee that be consider constitutional amendment

 our ambassador be on his way home now to make a full report on his observation on condition in france i would be very happy to meet general de gaulle any time that it can be appropriately arrange satisfactory to both person and if there be anything at all that can be work out

 we hope the french government we wish it well we want to see it as strong in the world as possible we want to believe that there be no irreconcilable difference between we and we believe when the chip be down we will all be together

 q. mr. president may i refer back to civil right for just a minute sir could you say how long you think the battle in the senate may take and whether you can win it without have to allow the bill to be either weaken or strengthen

 the president i think that the leadership can well assess that i would not want to estimate i do not think anyone really know how long the matter will be discuss but i believe that there be senator who feel very strongly both pro and con and they will be give adequate opportunity to express themselves then i believe the majority of the senate will have an opportunity to work its will

 q. mr. president more and more republicans be hammer away at the administration 's policy in viet nam these republicans claim that the administration 's policy be confused and uncertain and that the administration be deliberately hide the fact what do you say to these charge

 the president i be not aware of anything that we be hide i do not want to get into any debate on the basis of partisanship or membership in any party we have have the problem of viet nam for some time in both administration i work very closely with president eisenhower when he be here in connection with that problem and i expect both republicans and democrats to work with this administration in attempt to help we do what be good for our country

 q. mr. president in your letter to soviet premier khrushchev on wednesday regard cyprus you mention basic misunderstanding because of this misunderstanding and other would a personal meeting between you and khrushchev be desirable at this point

 the president i think that we be in adequate communication with each other i would be very happy to see the chairman when it be indicate that there be any thing that we can explore that would be helpful i know of no reason for such a meeting at this time

 q. mr. president in answer an early question about the soviet trade overture do you mean to imply that trade between the soviet union and the united states should be on an individual item basis in the mutual interest of the two country or be you open the possibility of a trade agreement between the soviet union and the u.s. such as the russians have with some of the western country

 the president the answer be no to both of your question

 q. mr. president in connection with your announcement concern various disease since the u.s. public health service have so strongly condemn the use of tobacco as a health hazard do you see any justification at all for continued government subsidy to tobacco grower

 the president i do not think that the report have be make a government report as yet i understand this committee be appoint by the surgeon general with the understanding that when they make their recommendation that report would be submit to all the department of government concern and that would be the second procedure follow

 they in turn would carefully digest and study its recommendation and then make the recommendation back to the secretary of health education and welfare the government agency concern be now make that study and in due time will make their recommendation

 q. mr. president i believe you say early in your administration that you be not consider any trip overseas before election time have there be any change in your thinking on that

 the president no

 q. mr. president you say early that you have be in communication with president de gaulle without ask you sir for any of the detail of those private communication could you say sir whether the united states and france have exchange general view about their policy in southeast asia

 the president i be aware of no detailed plan that general de gaulle have concern southeast asia our government have discuss with representative of his government certain phase of that situation but so far as i be personally aware i know of no specific detailed plan that the general may have advance

 q. mr. president in talk to a group of senior citizen about medicare you make this statement we be go to try to take all of the money that we think be unnecessarily be spend and take it from the have and give it to the have not that need it so much i just wonder if you could elaborate sir

 the president i think that explain itself we have take about $ 3 billion out of the budget as constitute last year 98.8 we reduce that budget by about $ 3 billion by cut $ 1,100 million out of defense almost $ r billion out of agriculture and almost $ 100 million out of the post office 150 out of atomic energy and so forth we reduce it $ 3 billion

 now we think that all of those reduction could be make they have appropriation for they last year we be not ask for appropriation for they this year so we will save $ 3 billion there

 but we be ask for an additional $ 2 billion to be put in the budget roughly that be $ 400 million extra interest rate on the public debt $ 600 million for space that be a billion then we have the poverty program and the appalachia program roughly a half million dollar $ 300 million extra for education 75 for urban renewal 75 for public housing and we expect those program to have money this year take from those program that we do not ask for money that they have last year

 we expect the total budget to be a little less than a billion dollar less than the kennedy budget of last year now that be possible we think because $ 17 billion be spend on defense need during the 3 year of the kennedy administration that we do not think be essential today

 while the population have be increase between 2 and 3 percent our budget have be increase approximately 5 percent or $ 5 billion per year this year instead of it increase $ 5 billion it be go to be reduce $ 1 billion this year instead of our deficit be $ 10 billion it be go to be less than $ 5 billion that mean that this year our deficit will be reduce by more than 5 ° percent

 we have a provision in our budget for contingency for any possible supplemental we hope that that will not be necessary but we have provide for it we be determine and this administration be dedicate to see to it that we live within the budget send to congress as i tell you now we will have another quarterly report april 10th and we hope we can far reduce budget ceiling at that time

 q. mr. president go back to an early question what be your reaction to the suggestion by general eisenhower that whenever the vacancy occur in the vice presidency that the president recommend a successor and the congress act on that

 the president i have not study general eisenhower 's proposal or suggestion that be a matter that would involve a constitutional amendment the president be not call upon to approve constitutional amendment that be now pende in a senate subcommittee i think that they can be trust to hear all the evidence and come to any conclusion that they think desirable

 q. do you have any plan mr. president to recommend your view to--

 the president i have state my view just now

 q. mr. president senator goldwater have charge that our long range missile be not reliable what be your comment on that charge

 the president i do not agree with senator goldwater

 q. mr. president last week the senate by a very narrow vote turn down the move to cut the import of beef from foreign country since then a republican senator from the west say that the administration be go to pay heavily for this action the pressure put on the senate at the poll next november what do you think of that gloomy prediction

 the president i think that we will have to wait until next november to see what happen at the poll but i be very happy with the poll at the present time

 q. mr. president be any major revision plan in the apollo gemini program

 the president i have no such recommendation at this time

 q. mr. president early this week secretary of defense mcnamara say that there be evidence that the north vietnamese be introduce heavy weapon into the fighting which would indicate large scale and more organized campaign will this development affect in any way your plan to withdraw american troop gradually and turn over more of the fighting to the south vietnamese

 the president i do not think that the american public have fully understand the reason for our withdraw any adviser from south viet nam and i think they should we have call back approximately 1,000 people a good many of those people several hundred be there training guard policeman once those people be train we feel that they could act as policeman as well as our people could act so we withdraw those people

 from time to time as our training mission be complete other people will be withdraw from time to time as additional adviser be need or as people to train additional vietnamese be need we will send they out there but we see no reason to keep the company of mp 's out there after they have already train the vietnamese who can perform the duty equally as well

 i think that a good deal will depend on what secretary mcnamara advise concern who be withdraw when they be withdraw and who be send out and when they be send out the secretary with general taylor and a very able staff be there now carefully study the question and will be there almost a week

 when his report be in we will carefully evaluate it and if additional man be need we will send they if other have complete their mission we will withdraw they but because we withdraw some mp 's from saigon who have train people to take their place there be no indication that we be not still just as interested in south viet nam as we have always be

 q. mr. president in view of the economic picture you describe at the beginning of this conference and the british action in raise their interest rate do you see any prospect of american interest rate go up this year

 the president we be hope that that will not be necessary we believe it be unlikely we can not speak for the investment community but we have hope that we can not materially increase our interest rate we think that to do so might offset some of the advantage that have come from the tax bill and we hope that capital will be available in ample quantity at reasonable interest rate to see new investment take place and new facility build that will employ additional people

 q. mr. president can you tell i in what capacity you believe mrs. kennedy will serve on the committee for the preservation of the white house

 the president i be terribly sorry but i do not hear your question would you please speak louder

 q. could you spell out possibly in what capacity mrs. kennedy will serve on your committee for the preservation of the white house will she head it or exactly what her job will be

 the president i will not go far than what i have say in the formal announcement when the committee meet and formalize i be sure that information will be available to you but i do not think i should go any far today than i have go

 mr. president thank you

the president lady and gentleman i have come before you today for a regular schedule televise notify well in advance press conference i do not drive myself over here but i do have to cancel an informal meeting with some tourist at the gate

 i be happy to see here today so many visit member of the american society of newspaper editor so many of my old friend you be welcome to your city

 i have some information on the state of our national economy in the first quarter of 1964 our gross national product rise to a rate of $ 608 billion this be up $ 8 billion from the fourth quarter of 1963 the first quarter gross national product be nearly $ 37 billion above the year early figure it be the large year to year gain i be tell by the chairman of the economic council this afternoon in more than 2 year

 personal income in march run at a rate of $ 480 billion an increase of $ 1 billion over february and $ 25.7 billion over the rate of march 1963 for the first time in 2 year we be make real progress in cut down unemployment we have a net gain of 1 1/2 million job from a year ago the jobless rate drop from 5.8 percent to 5.4 percent and some other fact i think be worthy of note

 labor have gain over 4 million job nonfarm job in a 3 year period and over $ 56 billion of add annual income business have gain a 50 percent advance in profit after taxis moreover these wage and profit gain have not be eat away by inflation price in the united states have be more stable than in any other industrial country in the world

 with strong market with steady cost with low taxis american business do not need high price level to assure continued growth and profit i look therefore to responsible business and to responsible labor to help we maintain our very fine record of cost and price stability and help we go all the way to full employment and a balanced budget and a strong enough competitive position to wipe out the balance of payment deficit

 i believe the accurate picture of what be happen in the railroad strike negotiation have be present fully and completely but this may interest you i do want to stress my deep and earnest hope that these negotiation will strengthen the collective bargaining process in our country to i it be vitally important that we preserve our free enterprise system free enterprise assume a capacity of both labor and management to handle their own affair and to settle difference by negotiation

 i do not think that we serve the cause of free enterprise by precipitate situation which could lead to a breakdown of this process the public interest must and will be serve i think it be in the public interest to proceed by negotiation wherever possible intensive negotiation day and night negotiation be now go on assist by the mediator who be experience man that i have appoint and who have come here at great sacrifice it be a genuine collective bargaining in the true sense of the word and i have great faith in the capacity of true collective bargaining

 there have be few strike since january 1961 than in any other 3 year period since the early thirty there have be few worker involve in strike in the period since january 1961 than during any comparable 3 year period since the early thirty there have be few man day lose because of strike since 1961 than in any comparable 3 year period since world war ii there be more strike and more people involve in they during the world war ii period but they be settle as you know much more quickly which mean few man day be lose

 i be today establish a program of presidential scholars the title will be give to outstanding scholar graduate from our secondary school public and private throughout the nation these award be to recognize the most precious resource of the united states the brain power of its young people to encourage the pursuit of intellectual attainment among all our youth

 on march 30th the senate pass a bill which would authorize and investigate and study the possible construction of a sea level canal connect the atlantic and pacific oceans this bill have be refer to the house committee on merchant marine and fishery this administration support this bill and hope that the house committee will give early and favorable consideration to it

 there be several alternative route for such a canal which will have to be study carefully before a decision can be make as part of the necessary study the united states and the government of colombia have already reach an agreement to conduct study relative to a survey for a sea level canal we be just able to announce this agreement today we hope to make similar arrangement with other country later

 i have instruct the secretary of defense to immediately dispatch a survey team to colombia to explore the possibility of construct a sea level canal in that country the secretary of defense have inform i that a 10 man team will leave for colombia tomorrow morning to begin work immediately the united states team will work in close collaboration with the team of the colombian government

 i will be glad to have any question

 q. mr. president how do you feel about civil disobedience as a tactic in the civil right struggle

 the president i think that we have a civil right bill pende in the senate that have pass the house it be very important that bill be pass at the early possible date i think passage of that bill will be helpful in this general situation

 we do not of course condone violence or take the law into your own hand or threaten the health or safety of our people you really do the civil right cause no good when you go to this extent but we be hopeful that all americans understand that we be go to pass the civil right bill because it be morally right and because we feel that these people have too long be deny their right

 on the other hand we do not think the violation of one right or the denial of one right should permit the violation of another right

 q. mr. president there have be some conflicting high level statement over the last week about our strength militarily as compare with russia 's particularly in the field of missile and air power would you give your own appraisal of that

 the president yes i be pleased with our strength i think we have make great gain during the last 3 year when you realize that each year during the last 3 year we have spend approximately $ 6 billion more on our military budget than be spend the last year of the eisenhower administration when you realize that we be spend $ 8 billion more this year than be spend the last year of the eisenhower administration on our military budget you realize that approximately $ 25 billion more have be spend than would have be spend if we have go on at the rate of the last year of the republican administration

 for that expenditure of $ 25 billion we have achieve extra combat division extra nuclear warhead extra missile strength i be pleased with those accomplishment

 under the law the secretary of defense mr. mcnamara be charge with the leadership and the direction of the defense department while he operate a tight budget i think he operate an adequate one i think his work have be constructive i have confidence in he the congress have confidence in he i believe the american people have confidence in he you can depend on what he tell you

 q. mr. president what do you see in the future and particularly in the near future in the field of soviet american trade and in particular do you see another major development in the wake of the wheat sale

 the president no i do not anticipate another major development at this time i be encourage by the fact that there be approach be make to purchase some thing from our country and the foreign relations committee of the senate be now have hearing and give study to the possibility of increase east west trade but so far as anticipate just the extent of that trade and in what line it will be i be not able to say

 q. mr. president in connection with the railroad situation you have emphasize the value of free collective bargaining and at the same time you have in this case bring the very considerable weight of the presidency to bear in influence the action by postpone a strike do you have some general guideline as to where the public interest in prevent strike come up against the public interest in the freedom to bargain

 the president i think that this be a matter that the mediator and the negotiator represent each side will attempt to evolve and find an agreeable ground and a common solution i be not an overly optimistic man but i do believe that under our collective bargaining system a result can be reach i hope and pray that it will be by the end of the week

 q. mr. president a group of newspaper editor many of whom be in this room now be poll as to your chance for win in 1964 they all agree that you would win it be a matter of how much you would win by would you care to comment on that sir

 the president no i hope that they feel in november as they do in april

 q. mr. president seven of the eight member of the seato military organization have take a strong stand on support for south viet nam the eighth member france have reservation on this do you believe that this impairs the effectiveness of that organization or our policy in south viet nam

 the president of course we would have prefer the decision to be unanimous and we would have like for our friend and ally france to have see the situation as do the other seven member of seato we be very pleased however that seven of we see thing alike we have a definite policy in viet nam you know what that policy be we think it be the good policy that could be derive from the alternative open to we and we be very pleased and happy that secretary rusk find that at least seven signatory of seato be willing to go along with we

 q. mr. president after nearly 5 month in office i wonder if you could assess for we whether you find the task more or less difficult than you have anticipate

 the president well i do not do a great deal of anticipate prior to november on just how difficult the task would be but i enjoy it there be a lot of work connect with it nearly everyone be anxious to help you do that job most people be hope and pray that you do a good job and a very few people i have call on that have not be willing to put their shoulder to the wheel and help i it be probably more difficult than i expect it would be but i be enjoy it and i be prepared to continue

 q. mr. president there have be considerable talk in the press and in congress relative to the lbj company ktbc own by mrs. johnson and relative to a secret option agreement the fcc have ask that that option agreement be make available i wonder what your view be on that if you feel it be proper that it not be disclose

 i also would like to know how you feel about the general ethical question that have be raise relative to high governmental official whether in the executive branch or the legislative who have interest in government regulate industry such as television

 the president well first i do not have any interest in government regulate industry of any kind and never have have i own no stock i own a little ranch land something in excess of 2,000 acre the commission have make no request of i or of my family for anything we be perfectly willing to comply i be sure the trustee would be with any request that they do make there be not anything that we have to secrete in any manner shape or form

 mrs. johnson inherit some property invest that property in the profession of her choice and work at it with pleasure and satisfaction until i force she to leave it when i assume the presidency as you know and i want all to know all of that stock have be place in trust as have be the practice with other president and although i own none of it mrs. johnson have place it in trust an irrevocable trust that can the property can be dispose of it can be lease it can be sell at any time

 any of those decision would still require the action of the commission even if you try to sell it you would have to have their approval but i see no conflict in any way she participate in no decision the company make it be entirely with the trustee in any event if she do participate the president would not have anything to do with it

 q. as you know we now have a record number of military and diplomatic dependent abroad well over seven hundred thousand in your concern for the american image and your admirable desire to improve the status of woman do not you think it would be worth the expense to provide language course for these wife before they go overseas

 the president i think it be always desirable for anyone to acquire as much knowledge of language as possible i have not give any study to the particular suggestion you make it seem to be a good one and i will have it explore

 q. mr. president in recent month the air force and certain member of congress have say that it be desirable for the united states to develop a new manned strategic bomber secretary of defense mcnamara maintain that it be not i wonder if you could give we your opinion sir

 the president at the moment i would not make a judgment because that decision will likely come to i in the near future when the joint chiefs of staff present their military recommendation to i at the early part of the year they be together on all of the recommendation with the exception that general lemay ask for the privilege of take fund already calculate in his budget and use they to study plan for a new bomber

 i tell he i would give consideration to his proposal i understand that proposal have be formulate and be now go through channel and will shortly come to the president when it get to i i will study it as well i can and make the decision that i think be in the national interest

 q. mr. president to go back to politic the late president kennedy in look ahead to the 64 election use to say that he expect a hard close fight would you say sir how it look to you this far ahead of the event

 the president i would think that be a very accurate appraisal of it and i would think it will be a hard fight a difficult one i would hope that it would not be too close but it may be i do not think that you can ever tell this far in advance how people be go to decide the choice but i have no doubt but what it will be a hard and long fight

 q. mr. president there have be a new factor inject into the civil right situation mr. president there have be allusion here today to difficulty of extremist action on the part of civil right leader but there seem also to be a possibility of extreme action on the part of some white people who be mightily oppose both north and south not only to the bill but to further progress for negroes

 would you assess this new factor and do you have any counsel to the people on that end of the battle

 the president yes i would counsel moderation to all group and understanding of their fellowman and try to appreciate his position i think if people would put themselves in the other fellow 's position they will all be a little more tolerant of the other man 's viewpoint there be people who feel very strongly on both side of this issue i find that in the 1957 bill i find it in the bill in 1960 it take we many day and night to try to find an area of agreement that the members of congress and the president would accept

 i expect that there will be many day ahead when strong force on both side will be appeal to people to side with they i only hope that we recognize that it have be a hundred year since abraham lincoln free the slave of their chain but he have not free all of the people of the bigotry that exist it have be a hundred year since president lincoln sign the emancipation proclamation but a great many people do not have equal right as of now

 while emancipation may be a proclamation it be not a fact until education be blind to color until employment be unaware of race as long as those condition exist in the country we be go to have protest and we be entitle to protest and petition under our constitutional right i hope though that the congress will act promptly with reasonable dispatch to bring those protest and bring those petition and bring these disturbance from the street and the alley into the court where they belong in order to do that we need a good civil right bill and the bill now pende in the senate be a good bill i hope it can be pass in a reasonable time

 q. mr. president could you list for we the pende legislative measure which you consider it essential that the congress enact before it adjourn finally this summer

 the president well that would take more time than i have but there be some that we be vitally interested in i have just name one the civil right bill that be pende in the senate we have difficulty in the house judiciary committee it spend a long time there then the house rules committee we file a petition and a good many member sign that to discharge the bill and finally the rules committee pass it

 it be now in the senate and it have be debate a good while there so that be a very important piece of legislation for the national welfare because we be go to have many problem even after it be pass adjust to it we ought to get it pass as early as we can so that before school begin next year we will have this law on the book and we can move ahead

 i think it be as important that we pass the food stamp plan in the senate as the civil right bill we pass it in the house by a good vote the other day it be very important not only to the consumer of this country but to the producer of this country and to the business people of this country it be a good piece of legislation it be soundly conceive i hope that we can get action in the agriculture committee of the senate in a short time perhaps as soon as the civil right bill be out of the way we can pass the food stamp bill

 the pay bill be one of the most important piece of legislation to continue good government in this country i have on my desk today a number of resignation from some of the very good man in government who tell i that they just can not stay any long they have be here 3 year and they can not stay any long at their present salary one man say he have have to borrow $ 16,000 another one say he have have to borrow 19,000 another one $ 6,000 and they just do not feel they could go on do that if the pay bill be not go to be pass i think that we be go to lose some of the good man in the government

 like sergeant that run the army some of the under secretaries and assistant secretaries and the man who do not get the notoriety but do the hard work from day to day be entitle to a raise i hope the congress will consider the bill in both committee although they have take one vote on it in the house that they can make some adjustment to meet the objection of the members and pass the pay bill

 i think the medicare bill be an extremely important bill that will provide medical care for our old people aged people under social security i believe that we be close to have enough vote to report that bill from the committee if we can make adjustment and modification to get that bill report and pass and have medicare under social security it would be a great day for the people of our country

 nearly every home have some father or mother or uncle or aunt or some member of their family that find need for medical care insurance too many of they do not have it and never will have it under the present system we have

 i think the poverty bill be very important all the cabinet members have testify on it secretary mcnamara the attorney general the secretary of labor the secretary of health education and welfare the secretary of agriculture we be all united we think that it be a comprehensive bill and have very sound principle it will do a lot to help we with our juvenile delinquency problem it will take our boy off the street and out of the alley and out of the pool room it will make it possible for we to train and educate people for national service that be now be turn back by the draft

 we think that bill be soundly conceive and very important so i would list just those four or five the pay bill the poverty bill the medicare bill the civil right bill the food stamp bill as five i should hope would be pass before the convention

 q. mr. president sir i wonder what you think about some of our columnist and fellow correspondent who have be write declassify material give to they obviously by some officer in the national security council and in the pentagon i refer to the material about macarthur and his command in korea i be sure that it be necessary to classify this material but i wonder why it be declassify at this time for just certain one

 the president i raise that question with the pentagon today at lunch and they tell i they be unaware of any of the material relate to general macarthur that have not already be publish in book prior to the recent revelation

 q. mr. president sir in the light of your unequivocal stand on civil right be you concerned about the election in november of independent elector in the southern states that would be commit to vote neither for you nor for your republican opponent

 the president yes i would always be concern about any elector that be not commit to vote for i if i be a candidate and i would do my good to convince he of the error of his way i do not anticipate however that there will be any substantial number that will feel that the future of this country should be place in the hand of independent elector but i think most of they will be associate with one of the two regular party the democratic party and the republican party

 q. mr. president since the maryland presidential primary be not exactly a contest between maryland democrats do not you think you might say something or do something to try to affect that result

 the president i give serious consideration to what my policy should be in connection with primary many year ago generally speak there could be an exception but generally speak i think it be unwise for i to interfere in primary or attempt to influence people in primary

 in connection with the presidential primary this year which be much more specific than my previous statement which apply to all primary i give think to what my course of conduct should be and conclude that i would not enter any primary i would do the very good job i could as president for all the people up until convention time and then let the delegate at the convention make their choice freely then my conduct would be determine after they make their choice

 thank you mr. president







 paul miller and my fellow americans

 last friday i talk to the editor of the lead newspaper of this land and today i be honor to appear before their boss this be the kind of a distinguished gathering that remind i of a meeting in the cabinet room the other day around that cabinet table sit three harvard man two yale man dean rusk and three other rhodes scholars and one graduate of the southwest texas state teachers college

 it be good to be here in this great city that give our nation one of the great artist of repartee that we know as al smith once al smith be make a speech in this city and a heckler yell tell they all you know al it will not take long and al without any hesitation answer i will tell they all we both know and it will not take any long

 today i want to talk about something that we both know about to you serious and concerned man who have gather here at this luncheon and lady i want to speak about the problem and the potential that lie ahead and the great purpose to which you and i and all americans must be dedicate

 the world have change many time since general washington counsel his new and weak country to observe good faith and justice toward all nation great empire have rise and dissolve great hero have make their entrance and have leave the stage and america have slowly often reluctantly grow to be a great power and a lead member of world society

 so we seek today as we do in washington 's time to protect the life of our nation to preserve the liberty of our citizen and to pursue the happiness of our people this be the touchstone of our world policy

 thus we seek to add no territory to our dominion no satellite to our orbit no slavish follower to our policy the most impressive witness to this restraint be that for a century our own frontier have stand quiet and stand unarmed

 but we have also learn in this century and we have learn it at painful and bloody cost that our own freedom depend upon the freedom of other that our own protection require that we help protect other that we draw increase strength from the strength of other

 thus to ally we be the most dependable and enduring of friend for our own safety depend upon the strength of that friendship to enemy we be the most steadfast and determined of foe for we know that surrender anywhere threaten defeat everywhere for a generation without regard to party or region or class our country have be unite in a basic foreign policy that grow from this inescapable teaching

 the principle of this foreign policy have be shape in battle have be test in danger have be sustain in achievement they have endure under four president of the united states because they reflect the reality of our world and they reflect the aim of our country

 particular action must change as event change condition we must be alert to shift reality to emerge opportunity and always alert to any fresh danger but we must not mistake day to day change for fundamental movement in the course of history

 it very often require great courage and resolution to maintain a policy which time have test than to change it in the face of the moment 's pressure our foreign policy rest on very test principle

 first since korea we have labor to build a military strength of unmatched might we have succeed if the threat of war have lessen it be largely because our opponent realize that attack would bring destruction this effort have be costly but the cost of weakness be far great than the cost of strength and the payment far more painful that be why in the last 3 year your government have strengthen the whole range of america 's defense

 we have increase defense spending in these 3 year by approximately $ 6 billion a year over the last year of the eisenhower administration and this year we be spend approximately $ 8 billion more on defense than we be during that last year

 second we have strongly resist communist effort to extend their dominion and successfully resist effort to expand their power we have take the risk and we have use the power which this principle demand we have avoid purposeless provocation and we have avoid needless adventure the berlin airlift the korean war the defense of formosa the cuba crisis the struggle in viet nam prove our determination to resist aggression and prove our ability to adapt particular response to particular challenge

 third we have work for the revival of strength among our ally initially to oppose communist encroachment on warweakene nation in the long run because our own future rest on the vitality and the unity of the western society to which we belong

 fourth we have encourage the independence and the progress of develop country we be safe and we be more comfortable in a world where all people can govern themselves in their own way and where all nation have the inner strength to resist external domination

 fifth we have pursue every hope of a last peace from the baruch plan name after that noble resident of this city to the test ban treaty we have seek and we have welcome agreement which decrease danger without decrease security in that pursuit for 20 year we have be the lead power in the support of the united nations in that pursuit this year as in every year we will work to reach agreement on measure to reduce armament and lessen the chance of war

 today we apply these same principle in a world that be much change since 1945 europe seek a new role for strength rather than content itself with protection for weakness the unity of communism be be erode by the insistent force of nationalism and diverging interest a whole new group of society be painfully struggle toward the modern world

 our basic principle be adequate to this shift world but foreign policy be more than just a set of general principle it be the change application of those principle to specific danger and to specific opportunity it involve knowledge of strength and awareness of limitation in each new situation

 the presence of offensive missile in cuba be a fact the presence of fallout in the atmosphere have be a fact the presence of guerrilla in viet nam at this hour be a fact such fact can not be deal with simply by historical judgment or general precept they require concrete act of courage and wisdom and often restraint

 these quality of endurance and innovation these quality of continuity and change be at work in at least six major area of continue concern to you

 first be our relationship with the soviet union the center of our concern for peace communist use force and intrigue seek to bring about a communist dominate world our conviction our interest our life as a nation demand that we resolutely oppose with all of our might that effort to dominate the world this and this alone be the cause of the cold war between we

 for the united states have nothing to fear from peaceful competition we welcome it and we will win it it be our system which flourish and grow strong in a world free from the threat of war and in such a competition all people everywhere will be the gainer

 today as we meet here there be new pressure new reality which make it permissible to hope that the pursuit of peace be in the interest of the soviet union as it be in ours and our own restraint may be convince the soviet leader of the reality that we in america seek neither war nor the destruction of the soviet union

 thus i be very hopeful that we can take important step toward the day when in the word of the old testament nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war anymore

 we must remember that peace will not come suddenly it will not emerge dramatically from a single agreement or a single meeting it will be advance by concrete and limited accommodation by the gradual growth of common interest by the increase awareness of shift danger and alignment and by the development of trust in a good faith base on a reasoned view of the world

 our own position be clear we will discuss any problem we will listen to any proposal we will pursue any agreement we will take any action which might lessen the chance of war without sacrifice the interest of our ally or our own ability to defend the alliance against attack in other word our guard be up but our hand be out

 i be take two action today which reflect both our desire to reduce tension and our unwillingness to risk weakness i have order a further substantial reduction in our production of enriched uranium to be carry out over a 4 year period when add to previous reduction this will mean an overall decrease in the production of plutonium by 20 percent and of enriched uranium by 4 ° percent by bring production in line with need and the chart show now that our production be here and our need be here and our reduction today will bring it here we think we will reduce tension while we maintain all the necessary power

 we must not operate a wpa nuclear project just to provide employment when our need have be meet and in reach these decision i have be in close consultation with prime minister douglas home simultaneously with my announcement now chairman khrushchev be release a statement in moscow at 2 o'clock our time in which he make definite commitment to step toward a more peaceful world he agree to discontinue the construction of two big new atomic reactor for the production of plutonium over the next several year to reduce substantially the production of u235 for nuclear weapon and to allocate more fissionable material for peaceful use

 this be not disarmament this be not a declaration of peace but it be a hopeful sign and it be a step forward which we welcome and which we can take in the hope that the world may yet one day live without the fear of war at the same time i have reaffirm all the safeguard against weaken our nuclear strength which we adopt at the time of the test ban treaty

 the second area of continue effort be the development of atlantic partnership with a strong and a more unified europe having begin this policy when peril be great we will not now abandon it as success move close we work for a strong and more prosperous europe and europe be strong and prosperous today because of our work and beyond our expectation

 we have support a close partnership with a more unified europe and in the past 15 year more peaceful step have be take in this direction than have be take at any time in our history

 the pursuit of this goal like the pursuit of any large and worthy cause will not be easy or will not be untrouble but the reality of the modern world teach that increase greatness and prosperity demand increase unity and partnership

 the underlie force of european life be erode old barrier and they be dissolve old suspicion common institution be expand common interest national boundary continue to fade under the impact of travel and commerce and communication a new generation be come of age unscarre by old hostility or old ambition think of themselves as europeans their value shape by a common western culture

 these force and the steadfast effort of all who share common goal will shape the future and unity base on hope will ultimately prove strong than unity base on fear

 we realize that share the burden of leadership require we to share the responsibility of power as a step in this direction we support the establishment of a multilateral nuclear force compose of those nation which desire to participate we also welcome agree new mechanism for political consultation on mutual interest throughout the world with whatever change in organization be necessary to make such consultation rapid and effective

 the experience of two world war have teach we that the fundamental security interest of the united states and of europe be the same what we learn in time of war we must not now forget in time of peace

 for more than a decade we have seek to enlarge the independence and ease the rigor of the people of eastern europe we have use the tool of peaceful exchange in good in person and in idea to open up communication with these restless nation that mr. khrushchev refer to sometimes as child who have grow up too big to spank we have use limited direct assistance where the need of our security have allow we to follow the demand of our compassion

 in that spirit within the last month i have exercise the power grant the president by the congress and i have reaffirm the right of open trade with poland and yugoslavia

 in the third area of continue concern latin america we have renew our commitment to the alliance for progress we have seek peaceful settlement of dispute among the american nation and we have support the oas effort to isolate communist control cuba

 the alliance for progress be the central task today of this hemisphere that task be go ahead successfully but that alliance mean more than economic assistance or investment it require we to encourage and to support those democratic political force which seek essential change within the framework of constitutional government it mean preference for rapid evolution as the only real alternative to violent revolution to struggle to stand still in latin america be just to throw the sand against the wind

 we must of course always be on guard against communist subversion but anticommunism alone will never suffice to ensure our liberty or never suffice to fulfill our dream that be go to take leadership leadership that be dedicate to economic progress without uneconomic privilege to social change which enhance social justice to political reform which widen human freedom

 the resumption of relation with panama prove once again the unmatched ability of our inter american system to resolve these dispute among our good neighbor at the outset of that dispute with panama the first morning i state to the president of panama by telephone our willingness to seek a solution to all problem without condition of any kind and i tell he that our negotiator would meet theirs anywhere any time to discuss anything and we would do what be fair and just and right we never depart from that willingness and on that basis the dispute be settle

 we now move toward solution with the generosity of friend who realize as woodrow wilson once say you can not be friend on any other term than upon the term of equality

 the use of cuba as a base for subversion and terror be an obstacle to our hope for the western hemisphere our first task must be as it have be to isolate cuba from the inter american system to frustrate its effort to destroy free government and to expose the weakness of communism so that all can see

 that policy be in effect and that policy be work the problem of this hemisphere would be far more serious if castro today sit at the council of the organization of american states disrupt debate and block decision if castro have open channel of trade and communication along which subversion and terror could flow it his economy have be a successful model rather than a dismal warning to all of his neighbor

 the effectiveness of our policy be more than a matter of trade statistic it have increase awareness of difference and danger it have reveal the brutal nature of the cuban regime it have lessen opportunity for subversion it have reduce the number of castro 's follower and it have drain the resource of our adversary who be spend more than $ 1 million a day we will continue this policy with every peaceful mean at our command

 a fourth area of continuity and change be the battle for freedom in the far east

 in the last 20 year in two war million of americans have fight to prevent the armed conquest of free asia having invest so heavily in the past we will not weaken in the present

 the first american diplomatic mission to the far east be instruct to inform all country that we will never make conquest or ask any nation to let we establish ourselves in their country that be our policy in 1832 that be our policy in 1964

 our conquering force leave asia after world war ii with less territory under our flag than ever before but if we have desire no conquest for ourselves we have also steadfastly oppose it for other the independence of asian nation be a link in our own freedom

 in korea we prove the futility of direct aggression in viet nam the communists today try the more insidious but the equally dangerous method of subversion terror and guerrilla warfare they conduct a campaign organize direct supply and support from hanoi this too we will prove futile

 armed communist attack on viet nam be today a reality the fight spirit of south viet nam as secretary rusk tell we from there yesterday be a reality the request of a friend and an ally for our help in this terrible moment be a reality the statement of the seato ally that communist defeat be essential be a reality to fail to respond to these reality would reflect on our honor as a nation would undermine worldwide confidence in our courage would convince every nation in south asia that it must now bow to communist term to survive

 the situation in viet nam be difficult but there be an old american say that when the going get tough the tough get go so let no one doubt that we be in this battle as long as south viet nam want our support and need our assistance to protect its freedom

 i have already order measure to step up the fighting capacity of the south vietnamese force to help improve the welfare and the morale of their civilian population to keep our force at whatever level continue independence and freedom require no negotiate settlement in viet nam be possible as long as the communists hope to achieve victory by force

 once war seem hopeless then peace may be possible the door be always open to any settlement which assure the independence of south viet nam and its freedom to seek help for its protection

 in laos we continue to support the geneva agreement which offer what we think be the good hope of peace and independence for that strife tear land at my instruction yesterday assistant secretary of state william bundy go to laos and he have already arrive there for a first hand examination of the development the development that have come in the last 48 hour at the moment we be encourage by report of progress toward the reestablishment of orderly legal government

 as for china itself so long as the communist chinese pursue aggression so long as the communist chinese preach violence there can be and will be no easing of relationship there be some who prophesy that these policy will change but america must base her act on present reality and not on future hope it be not we who must reexamine our view of china it be the chinese communists who must reexamine their view of the world

 nor can anyone doubt our unalterable commitment to the defense and the liberty of free china meanwhile we will say to our historic friend the talented and courageous chinese people on the mainland that just as we oppose aggression against they we must oppose aggression by their ruler and for the same reason

 fifth be our concern with the new nation of africa and asia we welcome their emergence for their goal flow from hope like our own

 we begin the revolt from colonial rule which be now reshape other continent and which be now create new nation our mastery of technology have help man to learn that poverty be not inevitable that disease and hunger be not law of nature having help create these hope we must now help satisfy they or we will witness a rise discontent which may ultimately menace our own welfare

 what we desire for the develop nation be what we desire for ourselves economic progress which will permit they to shape their own institution and the independence which will allow they to take a dignified place in the world community

 so let there be no mistake about our intention to win the war against poverty at home and let there be no mistake about our intention to fight that war around the world this battle will not be easy or it will not be swift it take time to educate young mind and to shape the structure of a modern economy

 but the world must not be divide into rich nation and poor nation or white nation or colored nation in such division i know you must realize stand the seed of terrible discord and danger in the decade ahead for the wall between rich and poor be a wall of glass through which all can see

 we recognize the need for more stable price for raw material for broad opportunity for trade among nation we be ready to help meet these claim as we have already do for example with the negotiation of the international coffee agreement and as we will do in the week ahead in the kennedy round we will continue with the direct economic assistance which have be a vital part of our policy for more than 20 year

 last year the congress reduce foreign aid from an original request of $ 4.9 billion later modify by general clay 's committee1 to $ 4.5 billion and congress reduce that to a total of $ 3.4 billion that they appropriate to i to deal with the problem of the 120 nation this year i order that our request be cut to the absolute minimum consistent with our commitment and our security allow for no cushion or no padding and that be do

 1 committee to strengthen the security of the free world

 every dollar cut from that request for $ 3.4 billion will directly diminish the security of the united states and you citizen and if in spite of this clear need and this clear warning substantial cut be make again this year in either military or economic fund i want to sound a warning that it will be my solemn duty as president to submit supplemental request for additional amount until the necessary fund of $ 3.4 billion be appropriate

 in these area and in other area of concern we remain faithful to test principle and deep conviction while shape our action to shift danger and to fresh opportunity

 this year be an election year in the united states and in this year let neither friend nor enemy abroad ever mistake grow discussion for grow dissension or conflict over program for conflict over principle or political division for political paralysis this mistake in judgment have be make twice in our lifetime to the sorrow of our adversary

 now let those at home who share in the great democratic struggle remember that the world be their audience and that attack and opposition to old policy must not be just for opposition 's sake that it require responsible presentation of new choice that in the protection of our security the protection of american security partisan politic must always yield to national need

 i recognize that those who seek to discuss great public issue in this election year must be inform on those issue therefore i have today instruct the departments of state and defense and the central intelligence agency to be prepare and to provide all major candidate for the office of president with all possible information helpful to their discussion of american policy i hope candidate will accept this offer in the spirit in which it be make the encouragement of the responsible discussion which be the touchstone of the democratic process

 in the past 20 year we have gradually become aware that america be forever bind up in the affair of the whole world our own future be link to the future of all in great capital and in tiny village in the council of great power and in the room of unknown planner event be be set in motion which will continually call upon our attention and make demand on our resource

 prophecy be always unsure but if anything be certain it be that this nation can never again retreat from world responsibility you must know and we must realize that we will be involve in the world for the rest of our history we must accustom ourselves to work for liberty in the community of nation as we have pursue it in our community of states

 the struggle be not merely long the struggle be unending for it be part of man 's ancient effort to master the passion of his mind the demand of his spirit the cruelty of nature yes we have enter a new arena the door have close behind we and the old stage have pass into history

 danger will replace danger challenge will take the place of challenge new hope will come as old hope fade there be no turning from a course which will require wisdom and much endurance so long as the name of america still sound in this land and around the world



 paul miller and my fellow americans

 last friday i talk to the editor of the lead newspaper of this land and today i be honor to appear before their boss this be the kind of a distinguished gathering that remind i of a meeting in the cabinet room the other day around that cabinet table sit three harvard man two yale man dean rusk and three other rhodes scholars and one graduate of the southwest texas state teachers college

 it be good to be here in this great city that give our nation one of the great artist of repartee that we know as al smith once al smith be make a speech in this city and a heckler yell tell they all you know al it will not take long and al without any hesitation answer i will tell they all we both know and it will not take any long

 today i want to talk about something that we both know about to you serious and concerned man who have gather here at this luncheon and lady i want to speak about the problem and the potential that lie ahead and the great purpose to which you and i and all americans must be dedicate

 the presence of offensive missile in cuba be a fact the presence of fallout in the atmosphere have be a fact the presence of guerrilla in viet nam at this hour be a fact such fact can not be deal with simply by historical judgment or general precept they require concrete act of courage and wisdom and often restraint

 these quality of endurance and innovation these quality of continuity and change be at work in at least six major area of continue concern to you

 first be our relationship with the soviet union the center of our concern for peace communist use force and intrigue seek to bring about a communist dominate world our conviction our interest our life as a nation demand that we resolutely oppose with all of our might that effort to dominate the world this and this alone be the cause of the cold war between we

 for the united states have nothing to fear from peaceful competition we welcome it and we will win it it be our system which flourish and grow strong in a world free from the threat of war and in such a competition all people everywhere will be the gainer

 thus i be very hopeful that we can take important step toward the day when in the word of the old testament nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war anymore

 we must remember that peace will not come suddenly it will not emerge dramatically from a single agreement or a single meeting it will be advance by concrete and limited accommodation by the gradual growth of common interest by the increase awareness of shift danger and alignment and by the development of trust in a good faith base on a reasoned view of the world

 our own position be clear we will discuss any problem we will listen to any proposal we will pursue any agreement we will take any action which might lessen the chance of war without sacrifice the interest of our ally or our own ability to defend the alliance against attack in other word our guard be up but our hand be out

 i be take two action today which reflect both our desire to reduce tension and our unwillingness to risk weakness i have order a further substantial reduction in our production of enriched uranium to be carry out over a 4 year period when add to previous reduction this will mean an overall decrease in the production of plutonium by 20 percent and of enriched uranium by 4 ° percent by bring production in line with need and the chart show now that our production be here and our need be here and our reduction today will bring it here we think we will reduce tension while we maintain all the necessary power

 we must not operate a wpa nuclear project just to provide employment when our need have be meet and in reach these decision i have be in close consultation with prime minister douglas home simultaneously with my announcement now chairman khrushchev be release a statement in moscow at 2 o'clock our time in which he make definite commitment to step toward a more peaceful world he agree to discontinue the construction of two big new atomic reactor for the production of plutonium over the next several year to reduce substantially the production of u235 for nuclear weapon and to allocate more fissionable material for peaceful use

 this be not disarmament this be not a declaration of peace but it be a hopeful sign and it be a step forward which we welcome and which we can take in the hope that the world may yet one day live without the fear of war at the same time i have reaffirm all the safeguard against weaken our nuclear strength which we adopt at the time of the test ban treaty

 the second area of continue effort be the development of atlantic partnership with a strong and a more unified europe having begin this policy when peril be great we will not now abandon it as success move close we work for a strong and more prosperous europe and europe be strong and prosperous today because of our work and beyond our expectation

 we have support a close partnership with a more unified europe and in the past 15 year more peaceful step have be take in this direction than have be take at any time in our history

 the pursuit of this goal like the pursuit of any large and worthy cause will not be easy or will not be untrouble but the reality of the modern world teach that increase greatness and prosperity demand increase unity and partnership

 the underlie force of european life be erode old barrier and they be dissolve old suspicion common institution be expand common interest national boundary continue to fade under the impact of travel and commerce and communication a new generation be come of age unscarre by old hostility or old ambition think of themselves as europeans their value shape by a common western culture

 these force and the steadfast effort of all who share common goal will shape the future and unity base on hope will ultimately prove strong than unity base on fear

 we realize that share the burden of leadership require we to share the responsibility of power as a step in this direction we support the establishment of a multilateral nuclear force compose of those nation which desire to participate we also welcome agree new mechanism for political consultation on mutual interest throughout the world with whatever change in organization be necessary to make such consultation rapid and effective

 the experience of two world war have teach we that the fundamental security interest of the united states and of europe be the same what we learn in time of war we must not now forget in time of peace

 for more than a decade we have seek to enlarge the independence and ease the rigor of the people of eastern europe we have use the tool of peaceful exchange in good in person and in idea to open up communication with these restless nation that mr. khrushchev refer to sometimes as child who have grow up too big to spank we have use limited direct assistance where the need of our security have allow we to follow the demand of our compassion

 in that spirit within the last month i have exercise the power grant the president by the congress and i have reaffirm the right of open trade with poland and yugoslavia

 in the third area of continue concern latin america we have renew our commitment to the alliance for progress we have seek peaceful settlement of dispute among the american nation and we have support the oas effort to isolate communist control cuba

 the alliance for progress be the central task today of this hemisphere that task be go ahead successfully but that alliance mean more than economic assistance or investment it require we to encourage and to support those democratic political force which seek essential change within the framework of constitutional government it mean preference for rapid evolution as the only real alternative to violent revolution to struggle to stand still in latin america be just to throw the sand against the wind

 we must of course always be on guard against communist subversion but anticommunism alone will never suffice to ensure our liberty or never suffice to fulfill our dream that be go to take leadership leadership that be dedicate to economic progress without uneconomic privilege to social change which enhance social justice to political reform which widen human freedom

 the resumption of relation with panama prove once again the unmatched ability of our inter american system to resolve these dispute among our good neighbor at the outset of that dispute with panama the first morning i state to the president of panama by telephone our willingness to seek a solution to all problem without condition of any kind and i tell he that our negotiator would meet theirs anywhere any time to discuss anything and we would do what be fair and just and right we never depart from that willingness and on that basis the dispute be settle

 we now move toward solution with the generosity of friend who realize as woodrow wilson once say you can not be friend on any other term than upon the term of equality

 the use of cuba as a base for subversion and terror be an obstacle to our hope for the western hemisphere our first task must be as it have be to isolate cuba from the inter american system to frustrate its effort to destroy free government and to expose the weakness of communism so that all can see

 that policy be in effect and that policy be work the problem of this hemisphere would be far more serious if castro today sit at the council of the organization of american states disrupt debate and block decision if castro have open channel of trade and communication along which subversion and terror could flow it his economy have be a successful model rather than a dismal warning to all of his neighbor

 the effectiveness of our policy be more than a matter of trade statistic it have increase awareness of difference and danger it have reveal the brutal nature of the cuban regime it have lessen opportunity for subversion it have reduce the number of castro 's follower and it have drain the resource of our adversary who be spend more than $ 1 million a day we will continue this policy with every peaceful mean at our command

 a fourth area of continuity and change be the battle for freedom in the far east

 in the last 20 year in two war million of americans have fight to prevent the armed conquest of free asia having invest so heavily in the past we will not weaken in the present

 the first american diplomatic mission to the far east be instruct to inform all country that we will never make conquest or ask any nation to let we establish ourselves in their country that be our policy in 1832 that be our policy in 1964

 our conquering force leave asia after world war ii with less territory under our flag than ever before but if we have desire no conquest for ourselves we have also steadfastly oppose it for other the independence of asian nation be a link in our own freedom

 in korea we prove the futility of direct aggression in viet nam the communists today try the more insidious but the equally dangerous method of subversion terror and guerrilla warfare they conduct a campaign organize direct supply and support from hanoi this too we will prove futile

 armed communist attack on viet nam be today a reality the fight spirit of south viet nam as secretary rusk tell we from there yesterday be a reality the request of a friend and an ally for our help in this terrible moment be a reality the statement of the seato ally that communist defeat be essential be a reality to fail to respond to these reality would reflect on our honor as a nation would undermine worldwide confidence in our courage would convince every nation in south asia that it must now bow to communist term to survive

 the situation in viet nam be difficult but there be an old american say that when the going get tough the tough get go so let no one doubt that we be in this battle as long as south viet nam want our support and need our assistance to protect its freedom

 i have already order measure to step up the fighting capacity of the south vietnamese force to help improve the welfare and the morale of their civilian population to keep our force at whatever level continue independence and freedom require no negotiate settlement in viet nam be possible as long as the communists hope to achieve victory by force

 once war seem hopeless then peace may be possible the door be always open to any settlement which assure the independence of south viet nam and its freedom to seek help for its protection

 in laos we continue to support the geneva agreement which offer what we think be the good hope of peace and independence for that strife tear land at my instruction yesterday assistant secretary of state william bundy go to laos and he have already arrive there for a first hand examination of the development the development that have come in the last 48 hour at the moment we be encourage by report of progress toward the reestablishment of orderly legal government

 as for china itself so long as the communist chinese pursue aggression so long as the communist chinese preach violence there can be and will be no easing of relationship there be some who prophesy that these policy will change but america must base her act on present reality and not on future hope it be not we who must reexamine our view of china it be the chinese communists who must reexamine their view of the world

 nor can anyone doubt our unalterable commitment to the defense and the liberty of free china meanwhile we will say to our historic friend the talented and courageous chinese people on the mainland that just as we oppose aggression against they we must oppose aggression by their ruler and for the same reason

 fifth be our concern with the new nation of africa and asia we welcome their emergence for their goal flow from hope like our own

 we begin the revolt from colonial rule which be now reshape other continent and which be now create new nation our mastery of technology have help man to learn that poverty be not inevitable that disease and hunger be not law of nature having help create these hope we must now help satisfy they or we will witness a rise discontent which may ultimately menace our own welfare

 what we desire for the develop nation be what we desire for ourselves economic progress which will permit they to shape their own institution and the independence which will allow they to take a dignified place in the world community

 so let there be no mistake about our intention to win the war against poverty at home and let there be no mistake about our intention to fight that war around the world this battle will not be easy or it will not be swift it take time to educate young mind and to shape the structure of a modern economy

 but the world must not be divide into rich nation and poor nation or white nation or colored nation in such division i know you must realize stand the seed of terrible discord and danger in the decade ahead for the wall between rich and poor be a wall of glass through which all can see

 we recognize the need for more stable price for raw material for broad opportunity for trade among nation we be ready to help meet these claim as we have already do for example with the negotiation of the international coffee agreement and as we will do in the week ahead in the kennedy round we will continue with the direct economic assistance which have be a vital part of our policy for more than 20 year

 last year the congress reduce foreign aid from an original request of $ 4.9 billion later modify by general clay 's committee1 to $ 4.5 billion and congress reduce that to a total of $ 3.4 billion that they appropriate to i to deal with the problem of the 120 nation this year i order that our request be cut to the absolute minimum consistent with our commitment and our security allow for no cushion or no padding and that be do

 1 committee to strengthen the security of the free world

 every dollar cut from that request for $ 3.4 billion will directly diminish the security of the united states and you citizen and if in spite of this clear need and this clear warning substantial cut be make again this year in either military or economic fund i want to sound a warning that it will be my solemn duty as president to submit supplemental request for additional amount until the necessary fund of $ 3.4 billion be appropriate

 in these area and in other area of concern we remain faithful to test principle and deep conviction while shape our action to shift danger and to fresh opportunity

 this year be an election year in the united states and in this year let neither friend nor enemy abroad ever mistake grow discussion for grow dissension or conflict over program for conflict over principle or political division for political paralysis this mistake in judgment have be make twice in our lifetime to the sorrow of our adversary

 now let those at home who share in the great democratic struggle remember that the world be their audience and that attack and opposition to old policy must not be just for opposition 's sake that it require responsible presentation of new choice that in the protection of our security the protection of american security partisan politic must always yield to national need

 i recognize that those who seek to discuss great public issue in this election year must be inform on those issue therefore i have today instruct the departments of state and defense and the central intelligence agency to be prepare and to provide all major candidate for the office of president with all possible information helpful to their discussion of american policy i hope candidate will accept this offer in the spirit in which it be make the encouragement of the responsible discussion which be the touchstone of the democratic process

 in the past 20 year we have gradually become aware that america be forever bind up in the affair of the whole world our own future be link to the future of all in great capital and in tiny village in the council of great power and in the room of unknown planner event be be set in motion which will continually call upon our attention and make demand on our resource

 prophecy be always unsure but if anything be certain it be that this nation can never again retreat from world responsibility you must know and we must realize that we will be involve in the world for the rest of our history we must accustom ourselves to work for liberty in the community of nation as we have pursue it in our community of states

 the struggle be not merely long the struggle be unending for it be part of man 's ancient effort to master the passion of his mind the demand of his spirit the cruelty of nature yes we have enter a new arena the door have close behind we and the old stage have pass into history

 danger will replace danger challenge will take the place of challenge new hope will come as old hope fade there be no turning from a course which will require wisdom and much endurance so long as the name of america still sound in this land and around the world

 business corporate profit after taxis this year be run $ 9 billion above 1961 $ 31 billion against $ 22 billion corporate cash flow after tax profit be run $ 16 billion above 1961 $ 65 billion against $ 49 billion the rate of return on stockholder equity in manufacturing corporation be 9.2 percent for 1960 it be percent for 1963 11.4 percent for the fourth quarter of 1963

 i will be happy to answer any question if you have any

 q. mr. president consider the background of an election year what be your feeling about hold congress in session should they run on a little bit with the civil right bill

 the president i would hope and anticipate the civil right bill would be dispose of in a reasonably short time we have be debate that bill now for almost 2 month and a good many amendment have be offer and be be consider but i hope they can pass the bill the end of the month or the early part of the next month and then we can get on with our food stamp plan in the senate our poverty bill our appalachia bill and our medical aid bill i hope that we can have the pay bill report by the committee very shortly

 in the event those bill be not act upon and some cynical people think that there may be a deliberate slowdown in the senate for the purpose of voting on the civil right bill among some people and among other for the purpose of not vote on any bill if there should be that kind of a slowdown i would seriously consider come back here of course after the republican convention and if necessary come back after the democratic convention

 the people 's business must come first and i think that the people of this country be entitle to have a vote on these important measure this administration be entitle to have a vote on they and i be go to ask the congress to vote they up or down

 q. then sir you be contemplate an extra session of congress

 the president i be not anticipate what the congress will do at this moment i hope they will pass all the bill if they do not pass the bill i will seriously consider call they back until they vote the bill up or down i will cross that bridge when i get to it

 q. mr. president how do you assess the alabama primary result what be the implication for the south in the democratic ticket in the south

 the president i think that the people of alabama decide they want to vote for their governor and they express their sentiment just as the people of wisconsin and the people of indiana have do in that connection in alabama they vote for he and i see that it have no real consequence beyond the boundary of alabama

 q. mr. president i believe you be go into maryland tomorrow on a goodwill tour of the appalachia area and i wonder if while you be there you will speak a good word for your stand in at the maryland primary election senator dan brewster

 the president well i be go to maryland tomorrow in connection with the appalachia program i have invite the senators of both party to go with i to all the states involve i be go to take part in no primary as i have repeatedly say

 q. mr. president sir there have be some letter recently from soldier in south viet nam that say the way the war be be operate there now that we can not win this be the basis for a request from congressman ed foreman of texas that the house armed services committee conduct a complete examination and review of the war in south viet nam

 what do you think of this

 the president we be constantly examine condition in viet nam as i state early in the day secretary mcnamara be go back there in the early part of this week secretary rusk be there for the last 2 or 3 week mr. mcnamara be there a short time ago the people who be responsible for carry on our operation there be constantly examine it to be sure that it be as efficient and effective as possible i have no doubt but what they will do their job well

 q. mr. president premier khrushchev say that there be no agreement between the united states and the soviet union permit american plane to fly in surveillance flight over cuba official of your administration say there be such an agreement

 i wonder sir if you can tell we first whether there be this agreement and second what the provision of the agreement be

 the president what official of this administration say that we have an agreement that there will be no over flight

 q. i believe sir in repeat request to people at the state department this point of view have come up

 the president i be not familiar with any such agreement that we have with the russian people

 q. mr. president you mention early governor wallace 's showing in the alabama primary i wonder if you will say something about the possibility of his performance in wisconsin and indiana on the national political scene

 the president well i think they speak very well for themselves he get 24 percent of the vote in wisconsin and a little less than 20 percent of the vote in indiana i would not think that would be less than 20 percent of the total vote poll would be any overwhelming endorsement of a man 's record

 q. many of the young people here have dog now that you have bring the subject up perhaps you would tell they the story of your beagle

 the president well the story of my beagle be that they be very nice dog and i enjoy they and i think they enjoy i i would like for the people to enjoy both of we

 q. mr. president in the past some president have worry about over exposure about be see too much and too often on tv and in the paper i wonder if you feel that that be a problem of your presidency

 the president well i strive to please and if you will give i any indication of how you feel about the matter i will try to work it into my plan in the future i have observe some little comment by some of the newspaper people about their desire to have live television and i be try my good to accommodate they although i do not have it very often i hope all of you be enjoy it today

 i sometimes think that these press conference can be conduct just as accurately and perhaps as effectively in the president 's office but i try to give you a variety as i tell you in the beginning i always want to remain accessible i hope the press will never be critical of i for be overaccessible

 q. mr. president also in light of pardon i

  q. mr. president governor wallace 's victory in alabama involve another thing and that be the possibility that his organization win in such a way that it will deny the bona fide democratic candidate the support in the november election

 i would ask you this what do you think in term of the health of a two party system of the maneuver for the so call free elector

 the president i think that people have a right to vote for any group of elector they want i think that they should have the right to vote for any candidate and any party that they desire without confusion

 q. mr. president in line with the question about your activity and your frequent appearance could you tell we when be the last time you have a physical examination and if the doctor have admonish you to slow down at all

 the president no the only hazing i have receive in that respect be from the newspaper people and i think we make a grievous error when i ask they to walk around the block with i the other day the doctor i think as a matter of fact i read a report from some doctor i do not know just which one and i have be examine frequently since i have be in the white house the last 6 month and sometimes at great length than i be be examine here today they tell i that my blood pressure be 125 over 78 and that my heart be normal i do not have any ache and pain i feel fine

 i get adequate rest and good pay and plenty to eat i do not know anyone that be concerned about my health certainly none of my doctor be concerned about it

 q. mr. president sir do you feel that an economic boycott of cuba can be effective without the full cooperation of the british and the french

 the president yes i think it be be effective to the extent of the cooperation they have give we i regret very much to see any of our ally who do not feel that they could cooperate with we all the way we regret that but nonetheless we be go to continue our policy of economic isolation in the hope that we can prevent the spread of castro 's communism throughout the hemisphere we be go to constantly insist that our ally do likewise but we do not have the responsibility for any foreign policy except our own they will in the last analysis make the final decision but we be go to continue to urge they to join we in a policy of economic isolation so that communism will not be channel out to other nation in this hemisphere

 q. mr. president be you hopeful about the outcome of senator fulbright 's mission to greece and turkey

 the president yes senator fulbright have announce some engagement in foreign capital several week ago when i learn that he be go to be abroad anyway i ask he to undertake some discussion that i think would be in the national interest that be not an unusual thing senator mansfield do that last year on behalf of the late beloved president kennedy and other senators and congressman frequently do it at the suggestion of the president or the state department i have every reason to believe that senator fulbright will carry on some very useful discussion and have a very good report when he return

 q. mr. president do your mission for senator fulbright indicate any approval of his recent speech that we ought to re think our policy in the foreign policy field especially insofar as panama and cuba be concern

 the president i state my view on senator fulbright 's position in my new york speech before the associated press my ask he to carry on these discussion for we do not indicate either approval or disapproval i have already indicate that we be not in agreement in toto with his view on either cuba or panama

 q. mr. president you be report as having say to chancellor erhard of germany that the germans should put themselves into the shoe of the russians to understand well the russian concern i want to ask you sir--

 the president i beg your pardon but i be not understand what you be say you will either have to speak loud or--

 q. mr. president you be report as having say to chancellor erhard that the germans should put themselves into the shoe of the russians to understand well their position about germany i wonder sir what would you think of the idea to apply this principle more universally to more and more country in their mutual relation to increase trust and confidence and to decrease tension

 the president well i have an informal discussion with a german newspaperman in company with a friend in the course of that conversation i express to he the determination of the american people to avoid war if at all possible that we want to find a road to peace and we would do everything we could in that direction i tell he that i think the good way to do that be to follow the golden rule to do unto other as you would have they do unto you and to try to find way and mean of find area of agreement

 i express that as my own view and as the policy of this country i have no difference with chancellor erhard in that regard i say no more to the newspaperman than i have say publicly follow our visit with he and than we say in our communique and as i repeat today

 i think it be very important to the people of the world that the leader of the country of the world pursue every possible road to peace and to try to achieve it i have no doubt but what the german people will in their own way and through their own qualified people follow that objective

 as i say there be no difference between chancellor erhard and myself now and there have not be our visit be a very fruitful one and we be in complete agreement the speech that he deliver a few day ago follow this article clearly point that out

 q. mr. president the economy have just set a peacetime record for no recession and the indicator pretty much look good for the future be it your thinking and the thinking of your economist in your administration that recession may be a thing of the past

 the president no i think that we have to be constantly concern with economic condition as i try to indicate from my statement to you from time to time while our unemployment have drop from 5.8 to 5.4 we would like to see it go down below 5 this year as quickly as possible we would like to see many of our young people that be now unemployed put to work under our new program that sargent shriver have suggest to the congress i think we have to be concern with the utilization of idle plant capacity

 we have to be concern with the value of the dollar we never know what next month or next quarter or next year may lead to we think that now we be enjoy a very fine record but we be constantly on the alert for any development that may indicate otherwise we be prepared to take whatever measure may be necessary to attempt to avoid any decline we would not say for a moment though that recession be not possible

 q. mr. president a short time ago you express the hope that other flag would join the united states in south viet nam in help to contain the war against communism can you say if any progress have be make in that line

 the president yes progress have be make and further progress i believe will be make follow secretary rusk 's visit in the next few day to the nato minister meeting i think that a good many country be give serious consideration to make contribution in that area to keep communism from envelop that part of the world we welcome that help and we expect to receive it

president hatcher governor romney senators mcnamara and hart congressmen meader and staebler and other member of the fine michigan delegation member of the graduating class my fellow americans
 it be a great pleasure to be here today this university have be coeducational since 1870 but i do not believe it be on the basis of your accomplishment that a detroit high school girl say in choose a college you first have to decide whether you want a coeducational school or an educational school
 well we can find both here at michigan although perhaps at different hour
 i come out here today very anxious to meet the michigan student whose father tell a friend of mine that his son 's education have be a real value it stop his mother from brag about he
 i have come today from the turmoil of your capital to the tranquility of your campus to speak about the future of your country
 the purpose of protect the life of our nation and preserve the liberty of our citizen be to pursue the happiness of our people our success in that pursuit be the test of our success as a nation
 for a century we labor to settle and to subdue a continent for half a century we call upon unbounded invention and untire industry to create an order of plenty for all of our people
 the challenge of the next half century be whether we have the wisdom to use that wealth to enrich and elevate our national life and to advance the quality of our american civilization
 your imagination your initiative and your indignation will determine whether we build a society where progress be the servant of our need or a society where old value and new vision be bury under unbridled growth for in your time we have the opportunity to move not only toward the rich society and the powerful society but upward to the great society
 the great society rest on abundance and liberty for all it demand an end to poverty and racial injustice to which we be totally commit in our time but that be just the beginning
 the great society be a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talent it be a place where leisure be a welcome chance to build and reflect not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness it be a place where the city of man serve not only the need of the body and the demand of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community
 it be a place where man can renew contact with nature it be a place which honor creation for its own sake and for what it add to the understanding of the race it be a place where man be more concerned with the quality of their goal than the quantity of their good
 but most of all the great society be not a safe harbor a resting place a final objective a finished work it be a challenge constantly renew beckon we toward a destiny where the meaning of our life match the marvelous product of our labor
 so i want to talk to you today about three place where we begin to build the great society in our city in our countryside and in our classroom
 many of you will live to see the day perhaps 50 year from now when there will be 400 million americans four fifth of they in urban area in the remainder of this century urban population will double city land will double and we will have to build home highway and facility equal to all those build since this country be first settle so in the next 40 year we must rebuild the entire urban united states
 aristotle say man come together in city in order to live but they remain together in order to live the good life it be hard and hard to live the good life in american city today
 the catalog of ill be long there be the decay of the center and the despoiling of the suburb there be not enough housing for our people or transportation for our traffic open land be vanish and old landmark be violate
 bad of all expansion be erode the precious and time honor value of community with neighbor and communion with nature the loss of these value breed loneliness and boredom and indifference
 our society will never be great until our city be great today the frontier of imagination and innovation be inside those city and not beyond their border
 new experiment be already go on it will be the task of your generation to make the american city a place where future generation will come not only to live but to live the good life
 i understand that if i stay here tonight i would see that michigan student be really do their good to live the good life
 this be the place where the peace corps be start it be inspiring to see how all of you while you be in this country be try so hard to live at the level of the people
 a second place where we begin to build the great society be in our countryside we have always pride ourselves on be not only america the strong and america the free but america the beautiful today that beauty be in danger the water we drink the food we eat the very air that we breathe be threaten with pollution our park be overcrowded our seashore overburden green field and dense forest be disappear
 a few year ago we be greatly concerned about the ugly american today we must act to prevent an ugly america
 for once the battle be lose once our natural splendor be destroy it can never be recapture and once man can no long walk with beauty or wonder at nature his spirit will wither and his sustenance be waste
 a third place to build the great society be in the classroom of america there your child 's life will be shape our society will not be great until every young mind be set free to scan the farth reach of thought and imagination we be still far from that goal
 today 8 million adult americans more than the entire population of michigan have not finish 5 year of school nearly 20 million have not finish 8 year of school nearly 54 million more than one quarter of all america have not even finish high school
 each year more than 100,000 high school graduate with prove ability do not enter college because they can not afford it and if we can not educate today 's youth what will we do in 1970 when elementary school enrollment will be 5 million great than 1960 and high school enrollment will rise by 5 million college enrollment will increase by more than 3 million
 in many place classroom be overcrowded and curriculum be outdate most of our qualified teacher be underpaid and many of our pay teacher be unqualified so we must give every child a place to sit and a teacher to learn from poverty must not be a bar to learn and learning must offer an escape from poverty
 but more classroom and more teacher be not enough we must seek an educational system which grow in excellence as it grow in size this mean well training for our teacher it mean prepare youth to enjoy their hour of leisure as well as their hour of labor it mean explore new technique of teaching to find new way to stimulate the love of learn and the capacity for creation
 these be three of the central issue of the great society while our government have many program direct at those issue i do not pretend that we have the full answer to those problem
 but i do promise this we be go to assemble the good thought and the broad knowledge from all over the world to find those answer for america i intend to establish work group to prepare a series of white house conference and meeting on the city on natural beauty on the quality of education and on other emerge challenge and from these meeting and from this inspiration and from these study we will begin to set our course toward the great society
 the solution to these problem do not rest on a massive program in washington nor can it rely solely on the strained resource of local authority they require we to create new concept of cooperation a creative federalism between the national capital and the leader of local community
 woodrow wilson once write every man send out from his university should be a man of his nation as well as a man of his time
 within your lifetime powerful force already loose will take we toward a way of life beyond the realm of our experience almost beyond the bound of our imagination
 for well or for bad your generation have be appoint by history to deal with those problem and to lead america toward a new age you have the chance never before afford to any people in any age you can help build a society where the demand of morality and the need of the spirit can be realize in the life of the nation
 so will you join in the battle to give every citizen the full equality which god enjoin and the law require whatever his belief or race or the color of his skin
 will you join in the battle to give every citizen an escape from the crush weight of poverty
 will you join in the battle to make it possible for all nation to live in endure peace as neighbor and not as mortal enemy
 will you join in the battle to build the great society to prove that our material progress be only the foundation on which we will build a rich life of mind and spirit
 there be those timid soul who say this battle can not be win that we be condemn to a soulless wealth i do not agree we have the power to shape the civilization that we want but we need your will your labor your heart if we be to build that kind of society
 those who come to this land seek to build more than just a new country they seek a new world so i have come here today to your campus to say that you can make their vision our reality so let we from this moment begin our work so that in the future man will look back and say it be then after a long and weary way that man turn the exploit of his genius to the full enrichment of his life
 thank you goodby

 we believe that all man be create equal yet many be deny equal treatment
 we believe that all man have certain unalienable right yet many americans do not enjoy those right
 we believe that all man be entitle to the blessing of liberty yet million be be deprive of those blessing not because of their own failure but because of the color of their skin
 the reason be deeply imbed in history and tradition and the nature of man we can understand without rancor or hatred how this all happen
 but it can not continue our constitution the foundation of our republic forbid it the principle of our freedom forbid it morality forbid it and the law i will sign tonight forbid it

 it have receive the thoughtful support of ten of thousand of civic and religious leader in all part of this nation and it be support by the great majority of the american people
 the purpose of the law be simple
 it do not restrict the freedom of any american so long as he respect the right of other
 it do not give special treatment to any citizen
 it do say the only limit to a man 's hope for happiness and for the future of his child shall be his own ability
 it do say that there be those who be equal before god shall now also be equal in the polling booth in the classroom in the factory and in hotel restaurant movie theater and other place that provide service to the public
 i be take step to implement the law under my constitutional obligation to take care that the law be faithfully execute

 we must not approach the observance and enforcement of this law in a vengeful spirit its purpose be not to punish its purpose be not to divide but to end division division which have all last too long its purpose be national not regional
 its purpose be to promote a more abide commitment to freedom a more constant pursuit of justice and a deep respect for human dignity
 we will achieve these goal because most americans be law abide citizen who want to do what be right
 this be why the civil rights act rely first on voluntary compliance then on the effort of local community and states to secure the right of citizen it provide for the national authority to step in only when other can not or will not do the job
 this civil rights act be a challenge to all of we to go to work in our community and our states in our home and in our heart to eliminate the last vestige of injustice in our beloved country

 the joint chiefs of staff when review the rs-70 emphasize the importance of the strategic reconnaissance mission the sr-71 aircraft reconnaissance system be the most advanced in the world the aircraft will fly at more than three time the speed of sound it will operate at altitude in excess of 80,000 foot it will use the most advanced observation equipment of all kind in the world

 the aircraft will provide the strategic force of the united states with an outstanding long range reconnaissance capability the system will be use during period of military hostility and in other situation in which the united states military force may be confront foreign military force

 the sr-7i use the same j-58 engine as the experimental interceptor previously announce but it be substantially heavy and it have a long range the considerably heavy gross weight permit it to accommodate the multiple reconnaissance sensor need by the strategic air command to accomplish their strategic reconnaissance mission in a military environment

 this billion dollar program be initiate in february of 1963 the first operational aircraft will begin flight testing in early 1965 deployment of production unit to the strategic air command will begin shortly thereafter

 appropriate members of congress have be keep fully informed on the nature of and the progress in this aircraft program further information on this major advanced aircraft system will be release from time to time at the appropriate military secret classification level

 i be pleased to announce today that in the year end july 30th american export of farm product break all record reach an all time high of $ 6 billion 151 million this represent a 20 percent increase in farm export in a single year a $ 1 billion and a 35 percent gain over the level for the year 1960 once again american agriculture have demonstrate its ability to succeed in highly competitive world market

 the trade surplus in agriculture last year be over $ 2 billion the high in 50 year this represent a substantial contribution to the plus side of our balance of payment ledger

 farm export contribute to the increase prosperity of our farm economy the late revise estimate from the department of agriculture show that net farm income in 1963 be $ 12 billion 518 million more than a quarter of a billion dollar high than we have estimate 6 month ago the net income per farm increase from $ 2,961 in 1960 to $ 3,504 in 1963 an increase in this period from 1960 to 1963 of more than 18 percent

 i think i should comment briefly on a number of international problem

 first i think most europeans know that the united states have never have any interest whatever in try to dominate europe or any other area of the world on the contrary the united states have constantly support the strengthening of the free nation of europe we believe that europe and the united states have great common interest common purpose and common obligation so we have never suppose that any european country would need to choose between its tie to the united states and its tie to europe

 we believe that any effort to force such a choice would be bad for europe bad for the alliance and i have find i might say general agreement on this view in my talk with prime minister home chancellor erhard president segni and many other european leader who have be here this year

 second i should like to call your attention to the excellent series of meeting which we have have in washington this last week with the leader of australia new zealand and malaysia these meeting have allow the united states to underscore its support for the freedom and independence of three most important pacific state and our friendship and understanding with these government i feel have be greatly strengthen

 third in the continue discussion of southeast asia let i state american policy once more we be determined to support the freedom and the independence of south viet nam where prime minister khanh and ambassador taylor have establish the close understanding with each other they be in continual consultation and the policy of the two nation be the same namely to increase the effectiveness of the whole program in that country political social economic and military

 it be true that there be danger and provocation from the north and such provocation could force a response but it be also true that the united states seek no wide war other friend suggest that this problem must be move to a conference table and indeed if other would keep the solemn agreement already sign at a conference table there would be no problem in south viet nam

 if those who practice terror and ambush and murder will simply honor their exist agreement there can easily be peace in southeast asia immediately but we do not believe in a conference call to ratify terror so our policy be unchanged for 10 year and in three different administration the united states have be commit to the freedom and the independence of south viet nam help other to help themselves

 in those 10 year we have take whatever action be necessary send man and supply for different specific purpose at different time we shall stick to that policy and we shall continue our effort to make it even more effective we shall do the same in our support for the legitimate government of laos

 fourth this week i have confer with the foreign minister of this hemisphere at the white house and our eye turn to latin america down in mexico there have be a highly successful meeting of the inter american committee on the alliance for progress the foreign minister be work here to meet a challenge to our peace and freedom

 that meeting be still in session so i must announce to you that i shall confine myself to the hope that in the spirit of the hemisphere a sound and i believe an effective answer will be find

 these four problem be not the only one that we have to deal with in the world today there be many many other such as danger in cyprus and disturbance in the congo and difficulty in the kennedy round but we still work for peace in cyprus and in the congo and for progress in the kennedy round

 we be a steadfast people in the united states and in the large sense the world be less dangerous and we be strong than we be 4 year ago so our work for peace must go on and will go on with success i believe

 i understand that we have with we today a group of journalist from latin america who be here to cover the meeting of the foreign minister i want to extend to they a very cordial welcome

 now i be ready to answer any question you may have

 q. mr. president how do you feel about the statement that have come from various official in new york city include the mayor and the deputy mayor to the general effect that there be indication of communist involvement in the recent racial violence in new york city and have you receive any such evidence that would back up such indication

 the president i receive detailed report at the close of each day with regard to the investigation that have be carry on by the federal bureau of investigation i do not care to comment in detail on those report until some conclusion have be reach and some recommendation make and until i think it be more appropriate to do so i would not hesitate to say that the impression i gain from read those report be that there be extremist element involve and at the appropriate time i think that their identity will be make known

 q. mr. president would you comment on what you hope or what you feel might be accomplish in your meeting with senator goldwater this afternoon

 the president senator goldwater through the facility of his office ask the legislative representative of the white house for an opportunity to meet with the president and on an unpublicized basis we inform the white house representative that we would be glad to meet with senator goldwater we have meet with senators every day and we would certainly be glad to meet with he any time that he think a meeting would be useful the 5:30 arrangement today be make

 i can not anticipate all the subject that will come up but i be very glad to talk to he and will try to be responsive and make the meeting as fruitful as possible

 q. mr. president in elaboration of your statement on south viet nam president de gaulle yesterday call for france communist china the soviet union and the united states all to get out of indochina and leave they to settle their problem themselves would you address yourself to that proposal sir

 the president i think i have already do that i point out that we have already have one conference and that we would carry out the agreement reach at that conference table that there would be no need of our presence there but until there be demonstrate upon the part of those who be ignore the agreement reach at the conference table some desire to carry out their agreement we expect to continue our effort in viet nam

 q. mr. president after senator goldwater say last week that if he be president he would give at least the nato commander more latitude in the utilization of nuclear weapon the republican convention reject an amendment to the platform restate the traditional civilian authority over the military what be your reaction to these action and could you give we your philosophy of civilian military relationship in this particular area of nuclear weapon

 the president well i think there should be complete understanding and confidence in this country and among all our friend abroad the control of nuclear weapon be one of the most solemn responsibility of the president of the united states the man who be president can never get away from that responsibility and can never forget it the american people rely on his good judgment they want that authority vest in a civilian they do not expect to abandon this duty to military man in the field and i do not think they have ever seriously consider that since the founding fathers draft our constitution

 i myself give close and continual attention to maintain the most effective possible command and control over these awesome weapon i believe that the final responsibility for all decision on nuclear weapon must rest with the civilian head of this government the president of the united states and i think and reiterate that i believe that be the way the american people want it

 q. mr. president in view of the opposition that your administration have show in the past to mr. tshombe how do you plan to deal with he now that he have return and take over control of the congolese government

 the president we be go to be as cooperative and as helpful as we can in an attempt to see that the people of that area have as good a government as be possible and we have every intention of be understanding and cooperative

 q. mr. president to go back to your meeting with senator goldwater do you and senator goldwater intend to enter into a pact to take the issue of civil right out of the campaign

 the president well i would say to the architect of this meeting this afternoon that i do not believe that any issue which be before the people can be eliminate from the campaign in a free society in an election year after all that be the purpose of election be to discuss the issue if candidate differ on important question it be up to the elector who must choose between they and in order to be able to satisfactorily choose between they they must hear their view

 now i believe that all man and woman be entitle to their full constitutional right regardless of their ancestry or their religion or the region of the country in which they may live i believe that dispute no matter how bitter should be settle in the court and not in the street i make that statement many time in press conference and speech over the country in the last several year that be the reason that after more than two third of the democrats in the congress approve the civil right bill and some 80 percent of the republicans in the senate support the civil right bill i sign the civil right bill

 i believe that all man and woman be entitle to equal opportunity so that they can be judge accord to their merit and not accord to some artificial barrier now to the extent that senator goldwater differ from these view or the republican party differ there will of course be discussion i intend to carry on some of it if i be a candidate

 the test of a free society be that it discuss and resolve these issue intelligently it do not sweep they under the rug when they become difficult i propose to discuss and debate the hard and difficult issue in the spirit of attempt to resolve they and on the assumption that the american people be willing to listen and be intelligent and be unafraid

 no word or deed of mine that i be aware of have ever or i hope will ever lend any aid or any comfort to this small minority who would take the law into their own hand for whatever cause or whatever excuse they may use

 if senator goldwater and his adviser and his follower will follow the same course that i intend to follow and that i expect the democratic party to follow which be a course of rebuffing and rebuke bigot and those who seek to excite and exploit tension then it will be most welcome and i think it will be a very fine contribution to our political life in america

 q. mr. president to return to the trouble in southeast asia for a moment--

 the president can you speak a little loud

 q. to return to your statement 3 in your opening statement on southeast asia do you and the defense department foresee a possible withdrawal of our military wife and child from saigon or other southeast asian command post in the foreseeable future

 the president no we have no plan along that line over the past several year i have hear rumor to that effect and have see news story make prediction along that line but we have no plan at the present time for any such action

 q. mr. president recently in san francisco some rather rough language be direct at you as be president by the republican opposition i wonder if you feel this might be some sort of a signal as to a rather rough campaign for the presidency that be come up

 the president most campaign be rough campaign i be an old campaigner i have be at it 30 year one of the first thing i learn at least so far as i be concern be the people be not much interested in my personal opinion of my opponent

 q. mr. president your statement that the meeting with senator goldwater be to be unpublicized suggest that you be unhappy at the publicity about it be there any breach of faith by senator goldwater in announce that he be go to meet you

 the president well you have ask two question there first there be no such suggestion at all i be not unhappy i hope i do not look unhappy i do not feel unhappy i do not know who suggest that to you but the question be raise that it be unpublicized and know the initiative and ingenuity of the american press i do not think it would be unpublicized very long

 i just suggest that it be rather difficult for a fellow to take a glass of water at the white house or even go out to the hydrant and get a drink without it be adequately publicize i can not even visit with my dog without a lot of publicity so i be not unhappy about it at all i just explain that i think it would be well to put it on the record and so far as i know senator goldwater be perfectly happy with it

 there be no breach of faith on his part and certainly none on my part i realize that someone might indicate because the suggestion in all its entirety be not carry out there might be some difficulty between we but my object in life have always be to not provoke fight but to prevent they if possible

 q. mr. president without regard to the inter american conference now underway here i take it you do not want to discuss the topic under negotiation but i wonder if you could tell we what your interpretation of the viewpoint of the american people be on the cuban problem and what should be do about it

 the president i think that their viewpoint be the same as the viewpoint of their government i think generally speak that viewpoint be be consider by the foreign minister who be meet here now i believe that they all recognize the challenge to peace and freedom which exist and the necessity for not only be aware of that challenge but attempt to combat it with every reasonable and wise mean available

 i believe out of this meeting the hemisphere will find a sound and effective answer and i think that there be some indication now that the policy that we have pursue heretofore and the one that we be suggest be follow now be be effective

 q. mr. president assume you be not ready to name he yet sir could you describe for we your ideal running mate in term of his characteristic and attribute

 the president the convention will meet in atlantic city and select a candidate for president and nominate he i assume he will make his recommendation and then the delegate will act i think that for i to make any announcement at this time as to my personal preference and i have none i have make no decision in the matter would be premature

 q. mr. president senator goldwater have say that he will make an important issue out of what he view as increase lawlessness and violence in the street of our major city be you willing to take this on as a campaign issue

 the president well i be against sin and i be against lawlessness and i be very much oppose to violence i think we have to put a stop to it

 to the extent that we have the power to do so in the federal government we be do so we be exert every action we know to keep violence to a minimum

 we do not have a national police force in this country we have not assume power that we do not have and we do not intend to but wherever there be violence we respond to it within the limit of our power and our authority

 we do have confidence in the local authority we do respect the sovereign states and the executive of those states we have communicate with the mayor and the governors and have make available to they all the facility of the federal government to cooperate with they and work effectively with they we will continue to do so

 we deplore man take the law into their own hand and man disregard the law wherever it take place we treat they all alike

 i do not think there be any doubt in anyone 's mind in the united states that the president of the united states the power of the presidency and the people of the united states be go to do everything within their power and within their authority to stop violence wherever it appear but our judgement be that it be not up to we to take over the authority of all the local government and not up to we to take over the authority of all the state government

 i seem to have read and hear that other people too be oppose to the federal government usurp the right of the states

 q. mr. president be there difference of opinion between the united states and south vietnamese official on the question of attack north viet nam and if there be difference what be they please

 the president the answer be no i state that early but i repeat it

 q. mr. president how do you assess your opponent this november barry goldwater and do you anticipate a close race

 the president i think what i think about senator goldwater and my prediction as to the outcome of the race be not very important i think that be a matter for the american people to decide i think what the people want to know be how i stand on issue and what my policy will be and what my party stand for they be much more interested in what the democratic nominee advocate than what he think about his opponent or his chance of win

 i have every confidence that the democratic party will adopt a good platform will select good candidate and that they will present their view to the people without regard to personality and the people in their wisdom will make a good decision

 q. mr. president about 10 day ago senator goldwater use some very strong personal epithet to challenge your own sincerity of purpose in the civil right issue now would you sit down this afternoon to discuss civil right without clear that matter up first

 the president yes yes i be not concerned with senator goldwater 's opinion of i of course i would like for it to be a good opinion but if it be not that be a matter for he he be entitle to his view and he have the right to express it if he think it be a proper thing to do and a wise thing to do

 the american people will make their judgment of the various statement that he may make from time to time i be perfectly willing to leave his opinion of i to the judgment of the people of this country

 q. mr. president could you give we your assessment of the effect governor wallace 's withdrawal from the presidential race will have

 the president i have be rather busily engage the last few day and i have not spend a great deal of time evaluate that situation i do not know how much support governor wallace have i do not know how it would affect the platform and the nominee of the two party all i know be that he decide to withdraw i have hear and anticipate that he would do that he confirm it but what effect it will have in november i do not know

 q. mr. president how active a campaign do you plan to conduct this fall

 the president whatever i think be wise and necessary and i expect to appear in various part of the country and be very concerned with see that my party and my platform and the view of my candidate be properly present i will make whatever contribution i can consistent with discharge my other duty and try to be as helpful to the ticket as possible at all time

 q. mr. president can you tell we if you plan any further action any further federal action in new york city and can you give we some elaboration of what you mean by extremist element involve in the disorder

 the president no i say that we get report from there every evening i do not think there be any question but what there be some extremist element involve in the violence that take place there i think that must be evident to everyone who read the newspaper so far as we be concern we be prepared to take whatever action may be necessary and desirable we have mr. hoover keep very close watch on it he have an adequate supply of manpower available to he he have they assign on specific investigation at the moment and we will follow it very closely and do whatever need to be do

 q. mr. president in present your view this fall and discuss the issue that you want to present would you be willing to debate senator goldwater on television

 the president well we will cross that bridge when we get to it

 q. mr. president sir there have be the claim in the campaign of an across the board attack on the foreign policy of the united states during recent year this have raise question here and abroad as to whether this wholesale kind of attack could cause your administration to trim its foreign policy in any major way could you answer these question sir

 the president i think foreign policy be an appropriate subject for discussion i think the people of this country really need no advice from anyone else in other part of the world about the decision they should make but i think they will certainly want to be sure that the foreign policy of their country be a proper one and i be prepared to present the view of my party on that subject and will do so at such time and at such length as may be desirable

 q. mr. president sir in response to an early question you say you hope neither candidate 's word or deed would encourage extremist do you feel that anything senator goldwater have say of late would encourage extremist

 the president i will leave that up to the judgment of the people and you i do not want to be pass personal judgment on the act of another individual i have give you my viewpoint on it that be a little mission you will have to do for yourself

 q. mr. president would you give we your reaction please to the attack that be make on senator goldwater by foreign official in the foreign press

 the president i think that the american people be perfectly capable of make their own decision with regard to the party and the candidate and i think that they will do that without the necessity of advice from anyone abroad

 thank you mr. president





my fellow americans
 as president and commander in chief it be my duty to the american people to report that renew hostile action against united states ship on the high sea in the gulf of tonkin have today require i to order the military force of the united states to take action in reply
 the initial attack on the destroyer maddox on august 2 be repeat today by a number of hostile vessel attack two u.s. destroyer with torpedo the destroyer and support aircraft act at once on the order i give after the initial act of aggression we believe at least two of the attack boat be sink there be no u.s. loss
 the performance of commander and crew in this engagement be in the high tradition of the united states navy but repeat act of violence against the armed forces of the united states must be meet not only with alert defense but with positive reply that reply be be give as i speak to you tonight air action be now in execution against gunboat and certain support facility in north viet nam which have be use in these hostile operation
 in the large sense this new act of aggression aim directly at our own force again bring home to all of we in the united states the importance of the struggle for peace and security in southeast asia aggression by terror against the peaceful villager of south viet nam have now be join by open aggression on the high sea against the united states of america
 the determination of all americans to carry out our full commitment to the people and to the government of south viet nam will be redouble by this outrage yet our response for the present will be limited and fitting we americans know although other appear to forget the risk of spread conflict we still seek no wide war
 i have instruct the secretary of state to make this position totally clear to friend and to adversary and indeed to all i have instruct ambassador stevenson to raise this matter immediately and urgently before the security council of the united nations finally i have today meet with the leader of both party in the congress of the united states and i have inform they that i shall immediately request the congress to pass a resolution make it clear that our government be unite in its determination to take all necessary measure in support of freedom and in defense of peace in southeast asia
 i have be give encourage assurance by these leader of both party that such a resolution will be promptly introduce freely and expeditiously debate and pass with overwhelming support and just a few minute ago i be able to reach senator goldwater and i be glad to say that he have express his support of the statement that i be make to you tonight
 it be a solemn responsibility to have to order even limited military action by force whose overall strength be as vast and as awesome as those of the united states of america but it be my consider conviction share throughout your government that firmness in the right be indispensable today for peace that firmness will always be measure its mission be peace

dr. newhouse chancellor tolley governor and mrs. rockefeller members of the congress distinguished guest member of the faculty lady and gentleman

 i know that you share with i the great admiration and pride that the generosity of dr. newhouse have make possible for this area of our nation and for this great institution we all be in his debt and in the year and generation and century to come we will see the product of this great adventure

 on this occasion it be fitting i think that we be meet here to dedicate this new center to well understanding among all man for that be my purpose in speak to you

 last night i speak to the people of the nation

 this morning i speak to the people of all nation so that they may understand without mistake our purpose in the action that we have be require to take

 on august 2 the united states destroyer maddox be attack on the high sea in the gulf of tonkin by hostile vessel of the government of north viet nam

 on august 4 that attack be repeat in those same water against two united states destroyer

 the attack be deliberate

 the attack be unprovoked

 the attack have be answer

 throughout last night and within the last 12 hour air unit of the united states seventh fleet have seek out the hostile vessel and certain of their support facility appropriate armed action have be take against they the united states be now ask that this be bring immediately and urgently before the security council of the united nations

 we welcome and we invite the scrutiny of all man who seek peace for peace be the only purpose of the course that america pursue

 the gulf of tonkin may be distant but none can be detach about what have happen there

 aggression deliberate willful and systematic aggression have unmask its face to the entire world the world remember the world must never forget that aggression unchallenged be aggression unleash

 we of the united states have not forget

 that be why we have answer this aggression with action

 america 's course be not precipitate america 's course be not without long provocation

 for 10 year three american presidents president eisenhower president kennedy and your present president and the american people have be actively concern with threat to the peace and security of the people of southeast asia from the communist government of north viet nam

 president eisenhower seek and president kennedy seek the same objective that i still seek

 that the government of southeast asia honor the international agreement which apply in the area

 that those government leave each other alone

 that they resolve their difference peacefully

 that they devote their talent to better the life of their people by work against poverty and disease and ignorance

 in 1954 we make our position clear toward viet nam

 in june of that year we state we would view any renewal of the aggression in violation of the 1954 agreement with grave concern and as seriously threaten international peace and security

 in september of that year the united states sign the manila pact on which our participation in seato be base that pact recognize that aggression by mean of armed attack on south viet nam would endanger the peace and the safety of the nation sign that solemn agreement

 in 1962 we make our position clear toward laos we sign the declaration of neutrality of laos that accord provide for the withdrawal of all foreign force and respect for the neutrality and independence of that little country

 the agreement of 1954 and 1962 be also sign by the government of north viet nam

 in 1954 that government pledge that it would respect the territory under the military control of the other party and engage in no hostile act against the other party

 in 1962 that government pledge that it would not introduce into the kingdom of laos foreign troop or military personnel

 that government also pledge that it would not use the territory of the kingdom of laos for interference in the internal affair of other country

 that government of north viet nam be now willfully and systematically violate those agreement of both 1954 and 1962

 to the south it be engage in aggression against the republic of viet nam

 to the west it be engage in aggression against the kingdom of laos

 to the east it have now strike out on the high sea in an act of aggression against the united states of america

 there can be there must be no doubt about the policy and no doubt about the purpose

 so there can be no doubt about the responsibility of man and the responsibility of nation that be devoted to peace

 peace can not be assure merely by assure the safety of the united states destroyer maddox or the safety of other vessel of other flag

 peace require that the exist agreement in the area be honor

 peace require that we and all our friend stand firm against the present aggression of the government of north viet nam

 the government of north viet nam be today flout the will of the world for peace the world be challenge to make its will against war know and to make it know clearly and to make it feel and to make it feel decisively

 so to our friend of the atlantic alliance let i say this this morning the challenge that we face in southeast asia today be the same challenge that we have face with courage and that we have meet with strength in greece and turkey in berlin and korea in lebanon and in cuba and to any who may be tempt to support or to widen the present aggression i say this there be no threat to any peaceful power from the united states of america but there can be no peace by aggression and no immunity from reply that be what be mean by the action that we take yesterday

 finally my fellow americans i would like to say to ally and adversary alike let no friend needlessly fear and no foe vainly hope that this be a nation divide in this election year our free election our full and free debate be america 's strength not america 's weakness

 there be no party and there be no partisanship when our peace or the peace of the world be imperil by aggressor in any part of the world

 we be one nation united and indivisible

 and united and indivisible we shall remain

 and let none of we stop to rest until we have write into the law of the land all the suggestion that make up the john fitzgerald kennedy program and then let we continue to supplement that program with the kind of law that he would have we write

 tonight we offer ourselves on our record and by our platform as a party for all americans an all american party for all americans this prosperous people this land of reasonable man have no place for petty partisanship or peevish prejudice the need of all can never be meet by party of the few the need of all can not be meet by a business party or a labor party not by a war party or a peace party not by a southern party or a northern party

 we be in the midst of the large and the long period of peacetime prosperity in our history and almost every american listen to we tonight have see the result in his own life

 but prosperity for most have not bring prosperity to all and those who have receive the bounty of this land who sit tonight secure in affluence and safe in power must not now turn from the need of their neighbor

 our party and our nation will continue to extend the hand of compassion and the hand of affection and love to the old and the sick and the hungry for who among we dare to betray the command thou shalt open thine hand unto thy brother to thy poor and to thy needy in thy land

 the need that we seek to fill the hope that we seek to realize be not our need our hope alone they be the need and hope of most of the people

 for 30 year year by year step by step vote by vote man of both party have build a solid foundation for our present prosperity too many have work too long and too hard to see this threaten now by policy which promise to undo all that we have do together over all these year

 i believe most of the man and woman in this hall tonight and i believe most americans understand that to reach our goal in our own land we must work for peace among all land

 america 's cause be still the cause of all mankind

 over the last 4 year the world have begin to respond to a simple american belief the belief that strength and courage and responsibility be the key to peace

 since 1961 under the leadership of that great president john f. kennedy we have carry out the great peacetime buildup of national strength of any nation at any time in the history of the world

 i report tonight that we have spend $ 30 billion more on prepare this nation in the 4 year of the kennedy administration than would have be spend if we have follow the appropriation of the last year of the previous administration

 i report tonight as president of the united states and as commander in chief of the armed forces on the strength of your country and i tell you that it be great than any adversary i assure you that it be great than the combined might of all the nation in all the war in all the history of this planet and i report our superiority be grow

 weapon do not make peace man make peace and peace come not through strength alone but through wisdom and patience and restraint

 and these quality under the leadership of president kennedy bring a treaty ban nuclear test in the atmosphere and a hundred other nation in the world join we

 other agreement be reach and other step be take and their single guide be to lessen the danger to man without increase the danger to freedom

 their single purpose be peace in the world

 and as a result of these policy the world tonight know where we stand and our ally know where we stand too and our adversary have learn again that we will never waver in the defense of freedom

 the true courage of this nuclear age lie in the quest for peace

 there be no place in today 's world for weakness but there be also no place in today 's world for recklessness we can not act rashly with the nuclear weapon that could destroy we all the only course be to press with all our mind and all our will to make sure doubly sure that these weapon be never really use at all

 this be a dangerous and a difficult world in which we live tonight i promise no easy answer but i do promise this i pledge the firmness to defend freedom the strength to support that firmness and a constant patient effort to move the world toward peace instead of war

 and here at home one of our great responsibility be to assure fair play for all of our people

 every american have the right to be treat as a person he should be able to find a job he should be able to educate his child he should be able to vote in election and he should be judge on his merit as a person

 well this be the fix policy and the fix determination of the democratic party and the united states of america

 so long as i be your president i intend to carry out what the constitution demand and justice require equal justice under law for all americans

 we can not and we will not allow this great purpose to be endanger by reckless act of violence those who break the law those who create disorder whether in the north or the south must be catch and must be bring to justice

 and i believe that every man and woman in this room tonight join i in say that in every part of this country the law must be respect and violence must be stop

 and wherever a local officer seek help or federal law be break i have pledge and i will use the full resource of the federal government

 let no one tell you that he can hold back progress and at the same time keep the peace this be a false and empty promise to stand in the way of orderly progress be to encourage violence

 and i say tonight to those who wish we well and to those who wish we ill the grow force in this country be the force of common human decency and not the force of bigotry and fear and smear

 our problem be many and be great but our opportunity be even great

 and let i make this clear i ask the american people for a mandate not to preside over a finished program not just to keep thing go i ask the american people for a mandate to begin

 this nation this generation in this hour have man 's first chance to build the great society a place where the meaning of man 's life match the marvel of man 's labor

 we seek a nation where every man can find reward in work and satisfaction in the use of his talent we seek a nation where every man can seek knowledge and touch beauty and rejoice in the closeness of family and community

 we seek a nation where every man can in the word of our old promise follow the pursuit of happiness not just security but achievement and excellence and fulfillment of the spirit

 this goal can be ours we have the resource we have the knowledge but tonight we must seek the courage

 because tonight the contest be the same that we have face at every turning point in history it be not between liberal and conservative it be not between party and party or platform and platform it be between courage and timidity it be between those who have vision and those who see what can be and those who want only to maintain the status quo it be between those who welcome the future and those who turn away from its promise

 this be the true cause of freedom the man who be hungry who can not find work or educate his child who be bow by want that man be not fully free

 for more than 30 year from social security to the war against poverty we have diligently work to enlarge the freedom of man and as a result americans tonight be free to live as they want to live to pursue their ambition to meet their desire to raise their family than at any time in all of our glorious history

 and every american know in his heart that this be right

 i be determine in all the time that be mine to use all the talent that i have for bring this great lovable land this great nation of ours together together in great unity in pursuit of this common purpose i truly believe that we someday will see an america that know no north or south no east or west an america that be undivide by creed or color and untorn by suspicion or strife

 the founding fathers dream america before it be the pioneer dream of great city on the wilderness that they cross

 our tomorrow be on its way it can be a shape of darkness or it can be a thing of beauty the choice be ours it be your for it will be the dream that we dare to dream

 the party of the people will not fail the trust of the people and our first trust be victory itself on november 3d and that be what we aregoe to have

 too much that be precious too much that we prize too much thatis part of america itself be at stake for any democrat anyone who take pridein be a democrat to rest these next 24 day

 this year as in no year before you work not as partisan forparty but you work as americans for america if victory be our first trust noless a trust be the margin by which that victory be win

 if our position in the world be not to be weaken if we be tospare ourselves wasteful year of antagonism and division and animosity hereat home the american people on november 3d must give a decisive reply thatwill be understand and hear throughout the world and make no mistake aboutit the spotlight of the world be on you november 3d

 when victory be ours for our country not for ourselves i wantit to mean a mandate for begin a new era in american affair an era ofcourage an era of commonsense and an era of american confidence

 when the next president take the oath of office next year itwill be 20 year since the end of world war ii when that war end youremember and i have not forget what we be tell

 voice at home and voice abroad predict

 --that depression would beinevitable
 --that communism would be irresistible
 --that war would be unavoidable

 and the american people listen and hear but refuse to acceptthose doctrine inhope in faith in confidence we take our stand

 in the full employment act of 1946 america make a commitmentagainst depression and make a commitment for prosperity here at home

 in the truman doctrine and the marshall plan of 1948 we make ourcommitment against the spread of communism and for the strength of freedomthroughout the world

 in all that we do we honor our old commitment as a nationand as a people against war and for peace

 the year have be long the trial have be many

 the burden have be great but the time be begin torespond to america 's steadfast purpose

 this administration be the first in a century not to experience arecession or a depression this administration be the first since midcenturyunder which no nation in the world have fall to communism this administrationi the first of the postwar age to offer a record not only of peace preservedbut of peace courageously and effectively pursue

 what the american people set out to do be come true

 other would have you believe that prosperity be false well askyourselve or your wife when you go home tonight if that be true you know itis real

 other would have you believe that freedom be falter but youknow that you be free now than you be when you be 21 and the yoke ofdictatorship and the yoke of colonialism be be throw off of nation allaround the world and new nation be be bear and independence and freedomare on the march

 other would have you believe that the pursuit of peace isunworthy work but you know it be the most noble work that any nation can do

 the point that i be make be simply this the meaning of ourvictory in november will be just this to assure this confident people ofleadership with confidence to match their own there be work to do and we caneither do it together united or we can do it divide eat on each other

 the platform on which i stand say the federal governmentexists not to grow large but to enlarge the individual potential andachievement of the people the federal government exist not to subordinate thestates but to support they

 when i become democratic leader after general eisenhower have sentthe party of which i be a member to a terrible defeat in 1952 i tell themembers of the senate who be in the democratic caucus that i be a free manfirst an american second a senator third and a democrat fourth in thatorder that when my president be right and when he speak for all america andwhen he seek to unite we against a common enemy he would have my support

 when i think he be wrong i would oppose he with decency anddignity and i would give he my reason for it and i would try to suggest analternative but i would never personally attack he or assassinate he or talkabout his wife or his child or his dog

 i keep that pledge and for 8 year i serve as leader of thesenate during a period that we have a republican president and a democraticcongress and every election every 2 year they reward we by increase mymajority the people of america want public servant in america to do what isb for their country first and if they do what be good for their country they will do what be good for themselves

 when i be call upon in a matter of moment to assume theawesome responsibility of the presidency follow that tragic day in dallas i say to the people of this nation and the world that with god 's help and withyour prayer i will do my deadlevel well i have do that

 i have spend long hour i have work hard i have work with aclear conscience i have do everything that i could with the talent that thegood lord give i to try to unite this country and to try to have peace in theworld

 we have a crisis in panama a few day after i go in and they shotour soldier we have a crisis in guantanamo and some of our people in thecountry holler let us send the marines in and i say no we will sendthe admiral in to cut the water off instead of a marine in to turn it on

 we have our ship fire on in the tonkin gulf and we make aprompt reply an appropriate reply but we have never lose our heart and i hopewe will never lose our head we be go to keep our eye in the star but weare go to keep our foot on the ground

 i think it be a wonderful thing for louisiana to do to give usthis dinner tonight i be proud of your delegation i be especially grateful tohale and lindy boggs and tommy for all the hard work and day that they spentwith lady bird luci and lynda help they through these states that welove

 i do not want to conclude this talk though without tell youthat some of my political philosophy be bear in this state as a youngsecretary i come to new orleans before i ever go to washington i sawsomethe about the political history of louisiana and i see a man who wasfrequently praise and a man who be frequently harass and criticize and ibecame an admirer of his because i think he have a heart for the people

 when i go to washington in the dark day of the depression as ayoung country kid from the poor hill of texas i have a stand rule with thepage office that every time senator long take the floor he would call i onthe phone and i would go over there and perch in the gallery and listen toevery word he say and i hear they all

 i hear a lot about the history of this state i hear a lot ofname in this state but i never hear he make a speech that i do not thinkwas calculate to do some good for some people who need some speech madefor they and could not make they for themselves
 the thing that i be talk about from coast to coast i talk to six newengland states last week and i be go to speak in six western states nextweek the thing i be talk about from coast to coast tonight and tomorrowand next week be the thing that he talk about 30 year ago

 he think that every man have a right to a job and that be longbefore the full employment act

 he think that every boy and girl ought to have a chance for allthe education they could take and that be before the gi bill of right

 he think that the old folk ought to have social security andold age pension and i remember when he just scare the dicken out of mr. roosevelt and go on a nationwide radio hookup talk for old folks'pension and out of this probably come our social security system

 he believe in medical care for those so that they could live indecency and dignity in their decline year without their child have tocome and move they into their house with they he be against poverty and hatedit with all his soul and speak until his voice be hoarse

 well like jack kennedy he believe in those same thing buttheir voice be still tonight but they have leave some to carry on and aslong as the good lord permit i i amgoe to carry on

 now the people that would use we and destroy we first divide we there be not any combination in the country that can take on russell long allen ellender lyndon johnson and a few other if we be together but ifthey divide we they can make some hay and all these year they have kepttheir foot on our neck by appeal to our animosity and divide we

 whatever your view be we have a constitution and we have abill of rights and we have the law of the land and two third of the democratsin the senate vote for it and three fourth of the republicans i sign it and i be go to enforce it and i be go to observe it and i think any manthat be worthy of the high office of president be go to do the same thing

 but i be not go to let they build up the hate and try to buymy people by appeal to their prejudice i hear a great son of texas whocame from an adjoining state whose name i will not call but he be expel fromthe university over there and he start west and he get to texas as a boy andstoppe to see a schoolmate of his

 he like thing so well in texas that he just decide to make ithis permanent address in 4 year he go to the congress after he have be inthe house 2 year he become the democratic leader and he serve a few yearsas democratic leader and he go to the senate and he serve in the senate 4years and he become the democratic leader in the senate he serve the districtthat mr. rayburn later serve

 when mr. rayburn come up as a young boy of the house he wentover to see the old senator the leader one evening who have come from thissouthern state and he be talk about economic problem he be talkingabout how we have be at the mercy of certain economic interest and how theyhad exploit we they have work our woman for 5 cent an hour they hadworke our man for a dollar a day they have exploit our soil they have letour resource go to waste they have take everything out of the ground theycould and they have ship it to other section

 he be talk about the economy and what a great future we couldhave in the south if we could just meet our economic problem if we couldjust take a look at the resource of the south and develop they and he said,"sammy i wish i feel a little well i would like to go back toold"-and i will not call the name of the state it be not louisiana and itwasn't texas--"i would like to go back down there and make they one moredemocratic speech i just feel like i have one in i the poor old state theyhaven't hear a democratic speech in 30 year all they ever hear at electiontime be negro negro negro

 so we have the law of the land and we be go to appeal to allamericans that fight in uniform and work in factory and on the farm to try toconduct themselves as americans equal opportunity for all special privilegesfor none because there be only one real big problem that face you it be noteven the economic problem and it be not the negro problem

 the only problem that face you be whether you be go to liveor die and whether your family be go to live or die

 i sit through 37 meeting of the national security council duringthe cuban crisis i never leave home in the morning but what i realize i mightnot ever see she again that day she might not be there or i might not bethere i sit at that table with the most train general and admiral we have with four and five star and their war map be out and they take we fromthis stage to that stage and we have our fleet move and we have our plane inthe sky and we have they load with our bomb and we know they have theirmissile point at we

 and the cool man in that room whose thumb be sit therethat could be put on the button be the commander in chief john fitzgeraldkennedy who have be abuse all over that country

 he be not here to defend himself but i say shame on you that inhis absence would attribute to he unworthy motive

 at oak ridge we have develop the mighty most awesome powerthat human ingenuitycould contemplate or conceive by a thumb on a button you can wipe out 300million live in a matter of moment and this be no time and no hour and noday to be rattle your rocket around or click your heel like a stormtrooper

 i say that because this be a moment when all nation must lookall way to try to find some way and mean to learn to live together withoutdestroye each other i have no reference to any nation any country or anyindividual i just say that when you look at history and you see what hashappene to we in our lifetime we have go through two war and then you seewhat the next war could bring we it be no time to preach division or hate

 if there ever be a time for we to try to unite and find area ofagreement it be now we be the mighty nation in all the world but thatpower must be use to prevent a war instead of start one

 i do not want to imply that there be any man in my party thatwant to start one or anyone in any other party that want to start one ithink the republicans be just as patriotic as the democrats and i have not metany man that i know that i think want to involve this country in any dangerthat he can avoid

 i just say it be time for all of we to put on our thinking cap it be time for all of we to follow the golden rule it be time for all of we tohave a little trust and a little faith in each other and to try to find somearea that we can agree on so we can have a united program

 i tell you about the support that vandenberg give truman ingreece and turkey about the support that i give eisenhower republican anddemocrat about the support that president kennedy receive in the cubanmissile crisis and this be an hour when we must not become so bitter or sodivide or hate each other so much in an election period that we will let theother nation think we be divide

 the kaiser think we be divide and would not go to war and hesank the lusitania and we become involve hitler think we be dividedbecause a few senator be preach isolationism and talk about munitionsmaker and he think that he could take a part of the world and we would sitthere in our rock chair and do nothing about it and he get fool

 let no would be conqueror ever mistake uncle sam we do not seekany war but we be prepared and ready and willing to defend our freedom andwe be not about to yield it or sacrifice it or whittle it away to anybody

 the election be come up november the 3d you have your choice you have two party you have two ticket you have man on both ticket whoare experience in the congress who serve there many year you do not have tohave anybody come down here and tell you what be right you do not have to haveanybody come down here and tell you what you ought to do you know what be bestfor you and you go do it and i be not even go to make a recommendation toyou

 if you think in your own heart that the course of wisdom for yourcountry be this course then you follow whatever you think it be because ibelieve that every other man be actuate by the same motive that i think i amactuate by he want to do what be right

 i have never see a man in congress that i think go there ona platform of do what be wrong he want to do what be right and i know thepeople of louisiana want to do what be right

 and i hope if you do what you think be right that somehow or otherit be the same thing that i think be right but if it be not i will not questionyour patriotism i will not question your americanism i will not question yourancestry i may quietly in the sanctity of our bedroom whisper to lady bird myown personal opinion about your judgment



 my fellow americans

 on thursday of last week from the kremlin in moscow the soviet government announce a change in its leadership

 on friday of last week communist china explode a nuclear device on an isolated test site in sinkiang

 both of these important event make it right that your president report to you as fully and as clearly and as promptly as he can that be what i mean to do this evening

 now let i begin with event in moscow we do not know exactly what happen to nikita khrushchev last thursday we do know that he have be force out of power by his former friend and colleague five day ago he have only praise in moscow today we learn only of his fault

 yet the man at the top today be the same man that he pick for leadership these man carry on the administration of the soviet government when he be absent from the soviet capital and that be nearly half of the time that he be in power

 mr. khrushchev be clearly the dominant figure in make soviet policy after lenin and stalin he be only the third man in history to have make himself the undisputed master of communist russia

 there be time when he be guilty of dangerous adventure it require great american firmness and good sense first in berlin and later in the cuban missile crisis to turn back his threat and action without war

 yet he learn from his mistake and he be not blind to reality in the last 2 year his government have show itself aware of the need for sanity in the nuclear age

 he join in the nuclear test ban treaty he join in the hot line which can help prevent a war by accident he agree that space should be keep free of nuclear weapon in these action he demonstrate good sense and sober judgment we do not think it be these action that lead to his removal

 we can not know for sure just what do lead to this secret decision our intelligence estimate be that khrushchev learn of the decision only when for he it be too late

 there have be discontent and strain and failure both within the soviet union and within the communist bloc as a whole all of this have be evident for all to see these trouble be not the creation of one man they will not end with his removal

 when lenin die in 1924 stalin take four year to consolidate his power when stalin die in 1953 it be not mr. khrushchev who first emerge

 but two man now share top responsibility in the soviet union and their exact relation to each other and to their colleague be not yet very clear they be experience but young man and perhaps less rooted in the past they be say to be realistic we can hope that they will share with we our great objective the prevention of nuclear war

 but what do all this mean for we in america it mean at least four thing

 first we must never forget that the man in the kremlin remain dedicated dangerous communist a time of trouble among communists require steady vigilance among free man and most of all among americans for it be the strength of the united states that hold the balance firm against danger

 second there will be turmoil in the communist world it be likely that the man in the kremlin will be concern primarily with problem of communism this would not be all good because there be problem and issue that need attention between our world and theirs but it be not all bad because man who be busy with internal problem may not be tempt to reckless external act

 third this great change will not stop the force in eastern europe that be work for great independence those force will continue to have our sympathy we will not give up our hope of build new bridge to these people

 fourth our own course must continue to prove that we on our side be ready to get on with the work of peace

 the new soviet government have officially inform i through ambassador dobrynin day before yesterday that it plan no change in basic foreign policy i speak frankly as always to the soviet ambassador i tell he that the quest for peace in america have never be more determined than it be now i tell he that we intend to bury no one and we do not intend to be bury i remind the ambassador of the danger that we all face 2 year ago in cuba i tell he that any soviet government which be ready to work for peace will find we ready in america i say to the ambassador that i would be ready to talk to anyone when it would help the cause of peace

 i believe that this be a good beginning on both side

 that same day the chinese nuclear device be explode at a test site near a lake call lop nor in the takla makan desert of the remote central asian province of sinkiang the building of this test site have be know to our american intelligence for several year in recent week the rapid pace of work there give we a quite clear signal that the long and bitter effort of this regime be lead at last to a nuclear test

 at first in the 1950 russia help the chinese this assistance in the spread of nuclear weapon may now be regard with some dismay in moscow we believe that this help be end in 1960 as the quarrel among the communists grow sharp soviet technician leave suddenly with their blueprint under their arm and the unfinished facility be just leave there stand and the expect supply be cut off

 but the red chinese keep to their choose purpose even as their economic plan collapse and the suffering of their people increase

 our own distinguished secretary of state mr. rusk give timely warning as the preparation at lop nor advanced and when the test occur i at once tell the world that this explosion will not turn americans and other free people from their steady purpose

 no american should treat this matter lightly until this week only four power have enter the dangerous world of nuclear explosion whatever their difference all four be sober and serious state with long experience as major power in the modern world

 communist china have no such experience its nuclear pretension be both expensive and cruel to its people it fool no one when it offer to trade away its first small accumulation of nuclear power against the mighty arsenal of those who limit communist chinese ambition it shock we by its readiness to pollute the atmosphere with fallout

 but this explosion remain a fact sad and serious we must not we have not and we will not ignore it

 i discuss the limited meaning of this event in a statement on last friday the world already know

 --that we be not surprised

 --that our defense plan take full account of this development

 --that we reaffirm our defense commitment in asia

 --that it be a long hard road from a first nuclear device to an effective weapon system and

 --that our strength be overwhelming now and will be keep that way

 but what i have in my mind tonight be a different part of the meaning of this explosion at lop nor

 communist china 's expensive and demanding effort tempt other state to equal folly nuclear spread be dangerous to all mankind

 what if there should come to be 10 nuclear power or maybe 20 nuclear power

 what if we must learn to look everywhere for the restraint which our own example now set for a few

 will the human race be safe in such a day

 the lesson of lop nor be that we be right to recognize the danger of nuclear spread that we must continue to work against it and we will

 first we will continue to support the limited test ban treaty which have make the air clean we call on the world"especially red china to join the nation which have sign that treaty

 second we will continue to work for an ending of all nuclear test of every kind by solid and verified agreement

 third we continue to believe that the struggle against nuclear spread be as much in the soviet interest as in our own we will be ready to join with they and all the world in work to avoid it

 fourth the nation that do not seek national nuclear weapon can be sure that if they need our strong support against some threat of nuclear blackmail then they will have it

 the two event i have discuss be large and full of meaning and i will discuss they at some length tomorrow with the legislative leader of both party they be come here to the white house for a full and complete briefing tomorrow afternoon yet they do not change our basic policy they just reinforce it

 now let i take a minute to say that the same thing be true about another important event this week it be the victory of another party with another leader in great britain

 the british labor party be the same party that hold power when the atlantic alliance be found when british and american pilot fly the berlin airlift together when englishmen join we in korea

 it be a party of freedom of democracy and of good faith today it have the confidence of the british people it also have our

 they be our friend as the conservatives before they be our friend and as government of both party have be friend for generation

 we congratulate the winner we send warm regard to the loser the friendship of our two nation go on this be our way with all our trust ally

 this have be an eventful week in the affair of the world it be not the first such week nor will it be the last for the world have change many time in the last 20 year great leader have come and go old enemy have become new friend danger have take the place of danger

 through this period we have steadily move toward a more hopeful world we have move toward widen freedom and toward secure a more lasting peace we will continue in this direction

 what happen in other country be important

 but the key to peace be to be find in the strength and the good sense of the united states of america tonight we be the strong nation in all the world and the world know it we love freedom and we will protect it and we will preserve it tonight as always america 's purpose be peace for all man

 almost 11 month ago at a still more fateful hour just after i have assume the presidency i speak to all of the congress and to our people of the purpose of america let i close tonight by repeat what i say then

 we must be ready to defend the national interest and to negotiate the common interest this be the path that we shall continue to pursue those who test our courage will find it strong and those who seek our friendship will find it honorable we will demonstrate anew that the strong can be just in the use of strength and the just can be strong in the defense of justice

 thank you and good night to all of you

 thank you and good night to all of you





thank you thank you very much thank you and good evening the sponsor have be identify but unlike most television program the performer have not be provide with a script as a matter of fact i have be permit to choose my own word and discuss my own idea regard the choice that we face in the next few week
 i have spend most of my life as a democrat i recently have see fit to follow another course i believe that the issue confront we cross party line now one side in this campaign have be tell we that the issue of this election be the maintenance of peace and prosperity the line have be use we have never have it so good
 but i have an uncomfortable feeling that this prosperity be not something on which we can base our hope for the future no nation in history have ever survive a tax burden that reach a third of its national income today 37 cent out of every dollar earn in this country be the tax collector 's share and yet our government continue to spend 17 million dollar a day more than the government take in we have not balance our budget 28 out of the last 34 year we have raise our debt limit three time in the last twelve month and now our national debt be one and a half time big than all the combined debt of all the nation of the world we have 15 billion dollar in gold in our treasury we do not own an ounce foreign dollar claim be 27.3 billion dollar and we have just have announce that the dollar of 1939 will now purchase 45 cent in its total value
 as for the peace that we would preserve i wonder who among we would like to approach the wife or mother whose husband or son have die in south vietnam and ask they if they think this be a peace that should be maintain indefinitely do they mean peace or do they mean we just want to be leave in peace there can be no real peace while one american be die some place in the world for the rest of we we be at war with the most dangerous enemy that have ever face mankind in his long climb from the swamp to the star and it be be say if we lose that war and in so do lose this way of freedom of ours history will record with the great astonishment that those who have the most to lose do the least to prevent its happening well i think it be time we ask ourselves if we still know the freedom that be intend for we by the founding father
 not too long ago two friend of mine be talk to a cuban refugee a businessman who have escape from castro and in the midst of his story one of my friend turn to the other and say we do not know how lucky we be and the cuban stop and say how lucky you be i have someplace to escape to and in that sentence he tell we the entire story if we lose freedom here there be no place to escape to this be the last stand on earth
 and this idea that government be beholden to the people that it have no other source of power except the sovereign people be still the new and the most unique idea in all the long history of man 's relation to man
 this be the issue of this election whether we believe in our capacity for self government or whether we abandon the american revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far distant capitol can plan our life for we well than we can plan they ourselves
 you and i be tell increasingly we have to choose between a left or right well i would like to suggest there be no such thing as a left or right there be only an up or down—[up man 's old old aged dream the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with law and order or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism and regardless of their sincerity their humanitarian motive those who would trade our freedom for security have embark on this downward course
 in this vote harvesting time they use term like the great society or as we be tell a few day ago by the president we must accept a great government activity in the affair of the people but they have be a little more explicit in the past and among themselves and all of the thing i now will quote have appear in print these be not republican accusation for example they have voice that say the cold war will end through our acceptance of a not undemocratic socialism another voice say the profit motive have become outmoded it must be replace by the incentive of the welfare state or our traditional system of individual freedom be incapable of solve the complex problem of the 20th century senator fullbright have say at stanford university that the constitution be outmoded he refer to the president as our moral teacher and our leader and he say he be hobble in his task by the restriction of power impose on he by this antiquated document he must be free so that he can do for we what he know be good and senator clark of pennsylvania another articulate spokesman define liberalism as meet the material need of the masse through the full power of centralized government
 well i for one resent it when a representative of the people refer to you and i the free man and woman of this country as the masse this be a term we have not apply to ourselves in america but beyond that the full power of centralize government"—this be the very thing the founding fathers seek to minimize they know that government do not control thing a government can not control the economy without control people and they know when a government set out to do that it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose they also know those found father that outside of its legitimate function government do nothing as well or as economically as the private sector of the economy
 now we have no well example of this than government 's involvement in the farm economy over the last 30 year since 1955 the cost of this program have nearly double one fourth of farming in america be responsible for 85 percent of the farm surplus three fourth of farming be out on the free market and have know a 21 percent increase in the per capita consumption of all its produce you see that one fourth of farming that be regulate and control by the federal government in the last three year we have spend 43 dollar in the feed grain program for every dollar bushel of corn we do not grow
 senator humphrey last week charge that barry goldwater as president would seek to eliminate farmer he should do his homework a little well because he will find out that we have have a decline of 5 million in the farm population under these government program he will also find that the democratic administration have seek to get from congress an extension of the farm program to include that three fourth that be now free he will find that they have also ask for the right to imprison farmer who would not keep book as prescribe by the federal government the secretary of agriculture ask for the right to seize farm through condemnation and resell they to other individual and contain in that same program be a provision that would have allow the federal government to remove 2 million farmer from the soil
 at the same time there be be an increase in the department of agriculture employee there be now one for every 30 farm in the united states and still they can not tell we how 66 shipload of grain head for austria disappear without a trace and billie sol estes never leave shore
 every responsible farmer and farm organization have repeatedly ask the government to free the farm economy but how who be farmer to know what be good for they the wheat farmer vote against a wheat program the government pass it anyway now the price of bread go up the price of wheat to the farmer go down
 meanwhile back in the city under urban renewal the assault on freedom carry on private property right be so diluted that public interest be almost anything a few government planner decide it should be in a program that take from the needy and give to the greedy we see such spectacle as in cleveland ohio a million and a half dollar building complete only three year ago must be destroy to make way for what government official call a more compatible use of the land the president tell we he be now go to start build public housing unit in the thousand where heretofore we have only build they in the hundred but fha federal housing authority and the veterans administration tell we they have 120,000 housing unit they have take back through mortgage foreclosure for three decade we have seek to solve the problem of unemployment through government planning and the more the plan fail the more the planner plan the late be the area redevelopment agency
 they have just declare rice county kansas a depressed area rice county kansas have two hundred oil well and the 14,000 people there have over 30 million dollar on deposit in personal saving in their bank and when the government tell you you be depressed lie down and be depressed
 we have so many people who can not see a fat man stand beside a thin one without come to the conclusion the fat man get that way by take advantage of the thin one so they be go to solve all the problem of human misery through government and government planning well now if government planning and welfare have the answer and they have have almost 30 year of it shouldn't we expect government to read the score to we once in a while should not they be tell we about the decline each year in the number of people need help the reduction in the need for public housing
 but the reverse be true each year the need grow great the program grow great we be tell four year ago that 17 million people go to bed hungry each night well that be probably true they be all on a diet but now we be tell that 9.3 million family in this country be poverty stricken on the basis of earn less than 3,000 dollar a year welfare spending be 10 time great than in the dark depth of the depression we be spend 45 billion dollar on welfare now do a little arithmetic and you will find that if we divide the 45 billion dollar up equally among those 9 million poor family we would be able to give each family 4,600 dollar a year and this add to their present income should eliminate poverty direct aid to the poor however be only run only about 600 dollar per family it would seem that someplace there must be some overhead
 now so now we declare war on poverty or you too can be a bobby baker now do they honestly expect we to believe that if we add 1 billion dollar to the 45 billion we be spend one more program to the 30 odd we have and remember this new program do not replace any it just duplicate exist program do they believe that poverty be suddenly go to disappear by magic well in all fairness i should explain there be one part of the new program that be not duplicate this be the youth feature we be now go to solve the dropout problem juvenile delinquency by reinstitute something like the old ccc camp civilian conservation corps and we be go to put our young people in these camp but again we do some arithmetic and we find that we be go to spend each year just on room and board for each young person we help 4,700 dollar a year we can send they to harvard for 2,700 course do not get i wrong i be not suggest harvard be the answer to juvenile delinquency
 but seriously what be we do to those we seek to help not too long ago a judge call i here in los angeles he tell i of a young woman who would come before he for a divorce she have six child be pregnant with her seventh under his questioning she reveal her husband be a laborer earn 250 dollar a month she want a divorce to get an 80 dollar raise she be eligible for 330 dollar a month in the aid to dependent children program she get the idea from two woman in her neighborhood who would already do that very thing
 yet anytime you and i question the scheme of the do gooder we be denounce as be against their humanitarian goal they say we be always against thing we're never for anything
 well the trouble with our liberal friend be not that they be ignorant it be just that they know so much that be not so
 now we're for a provision that destitution should not follow unemployment by reason of old age and to that end we have accept social security as a step toward meet the problem
 but we be against those entrust with this program when they practice deception regard its fiscal shortcoming when they charge that any criticism of the program mean that we want to end payment to those people who depend on they for a livelihood they have call it insurance to we in a hundred million piece of literature but then they appear before the supreme court and they testify it be a welfare program they only use the term insurance to sell it to the people and they say social security due be a tax for the general use of the government and the government have use that tax there be no fund because robert byers the actuarial head appear before a congressional committee and admit that social security as of this moment be 298 billion dollar in the hole but he say there should be no cause for worry because as long as they have the power to tax they could always take away from the people whatever they need to bail they out of trouble and they be do just that
 a young man 21 year of age work at an average salary his social security contribution would in the open market buy he an insurance policy that would guarantee 220 dollar a month at age 65 the government promise 127 he could live it up until he be 31 and then take out a policy that would pay more than social security now be we so lack in business sense that we can not put this program on a sound basis so that people who do require those payment will find they can get they when they be due that the cupboard be not bare
 barry goldwater think we can
 at the same time can not we introduce voluntary feature that would permit a citizen who can do well on his own to be excuse upon presentation of evidence that he have make provision for the non earning year should we not allow a widow with child to work and not lose the benefit supposedly pay for by her deceased husband should not you and i be allow to declare who our beneficiary will be under this program which we can not do i think we be for tell our senior citizen that no one in this country should be deny medical care because of a lack of fund but i think we be against force all citizen regardless of need into a compulsory government program especially when we have such example as be announce last week when france admit that their medicare program be now bankrupt they have come to the end of the road
 in addition be barry goldwater so irresponsible when he suggest that our government give up its program of deliberate planned inflation so that when you do get your social security pension a dollar will buy a dollar 's worth and not 45 cent worth
 i think we be for an international organization where the nation of the world can seek peace but i think we be against subordinate american interest to an organization that have become so structurally unsound that today you can muster a two third vote on the floor of the general assembly among nation that represent less than 10 percent of the world 's population i think we be against the hypocrisy of assail our ally because here and there they cling to a colony while we engage in a conspiracy of silence and never open our mouth about the million of people enslave in the soviet colony in the satellite nation
 i think we be for aid our ally by share of our material blessing with those nation which share in our fundamental belief but we be against dole out money government to government create bureaucracy if not socialism all over the world we set out to help 19 country we be help 107 we have spend 146 billion dollar with that money we buy a 2 million dollar yacht for haile selassie we buy dress suit for greek undertaker extra wife for kenya[n government official we buy a thousand tv set for a place where they have no electricity in the last six year 52 nation have buy 7 billion dollar worth of our gold and all 52 be receive foreign aid from this country
 no government ever voluntarily reduce itself in size so government program once launch never disappear
 actually a government bureau be the near thing to eternal life we will ever see on this earth
 federal employee federal employee number two and a half million and federal state and local one out of six of the nation 's work force employ by government these proliferate bureaus with their thousand of regulation have cost we many of our constitutional safeguard how many of we realize that today federal agent can invade a man 's property without a warrant they can impose a fine without a formal hearing let alone a trial by jury and they can seize and sell his property at auction to enforce the payment of that fine in chico county arkansas james wier over plant his rice allotment the government obtain a 17,000 dollar judgment and a u.s. marshal sell his 960 acre farm at auction the government say it be necessary as a warning to other to make the system work
 last february 19th at the university of minnesota norman thomas six time candidate for president on the socialist party ticket say if barry goldwater become president he would stop the advance of socialism in the united states i think that be exactly what he will do
 but as a former democrat i can tell you norman thomas be not the only man who have draw this parallel to socialism with the present administration because back in 1936 mr. democrat himself al smith the great american come before the american people and charge that the leadership of his party be take the party of jefferson jackson and cleveland down the road under the banner of marx lenin and stalin and he walk away from his party and he never return til the day he die because to this day the leadership of that party have be take that party that honorable party down the road in the image of the labor socialist party of england
 now it do not require expropriation or confiscation of private property or business to impose socialism on a people what do it mean whether you hold the deed to the or the title to your business or property if the government hold the power of life and death over that business or property and such machinery already exist the government can find some charge to bring against any concern it choose to prosecute every businessman have his own tale of harassment somewhere a perversion have take place our natural unalienable right be now consider to be a dispensation of government and freedom have never be so fragile so close to slip from our grasp as it be at this moment
 our democratic opponent seem unwilling to debate these issue they want to make you and i believe that this be a contest between two man that we be to choose just between two personality
 well what of this man that they would destroy and in destroy they would destroy that which he represent the idea that you and i hold dear be he the brash and shallow and trigger happy man they say he be well i have be privileged to know he when i know he long before he ever dream of try for high office and i can tell you personally i have never know a man in my life i believe so incapable of do a dishonest or dishonorable thing
 this be a man who in his own business before he enter politic institute a profit share plan before union have ever think of it he put in health and medical insurance for all his employee he take 50 percent of the profit before taxis and set up a retirement program a pension plan for all his employee he send monthly check for life to an employee who be ill and could not work he provide nursing care for the child of mother who work in the store when mexico be ravage by the flood in the rio grande he climb in his airplane and fly medicine and supply down there
 an ex gi tell i how he meet he it be the week before christmas during the korean war and he be at the los angeles airport try to get a ride home to arizona for christmas and he say that there be a lot of servicemen there and no seat available on the plane and then a voice come over the loudspeaker and say any man in uniform want a ride to arizona go to runway such and such and they go down there and there be a fellow name barry goldwater sit in his plane every day in those week before christmas all day long he would load up the plane fly it to arizona fly they to their home fly back over to get another load
 during the hectic split second timing of a campaign this be a man who take time out to sit beside an old friend who be die of cancer his campaign manager be understandably impatient but he say there be not many leave who care what happen to she i would like she to know i care this be a man who say to his 19 year old son there be no foundation like the rock of honesty and fairness and when you begin to build your life on that rock with the cement of the faith in god that you have then you have a real start this be not a man who could carelessly send other people 's son to war and that be the issue of this campaign that make all the other problem i have discuss academic unless we realize we be in a war that must be win
 those who would trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state have tell we they have a utopian solution of peace without victory they call their policy accommodation and they say if we will only avoid any direct confrontation with the enemy he will forget his evil way and learn to love we all who oppose they be indict as warmonger they say we offer simple answer to complex problem well perhaps there be a simple answer not an easy answer but simple if you and i have the courage to tell our elect official that we want our national policy base on what we know in our heart be morally right
 we can not buy our security our freedom from the threat of the bomb by commit an immorality so great as say to a billion human being now enslave behind the iron curtain give up your dream of freedom because to save our own skin we be willing to make a deal with your slave master alexander hamilton say a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger be prepare for a master and deserve one now let us set the record straight there be no argument over the choice between peace and war but there be only one guarantee way you can have peace and you can have it in the next second surrender
 admittedly there be a risk in any course we follow other than this but every lesson of history tell we that the great risk lie in appeasement and this be the specter our well mean liberal friend refuse to face that their policy of accommodation be appeasement and it give no choice between peace and war only between fight or surrender if we continue to accommodate continue to back and retreat eventually we have to face the final demand the ultimatum and what then when nikita khrushchev have tell his people he know what our answer will be he have tell they that we be retreat under the pressure of the cold war and someday when the time come to deliver the final ultimatum our surrender will be voluntary because by that time we will have be weaken from within spiritually morally and economically he believe this because from our side he be hear voice plead for peace at any price or well red than dead or as one commentator put it he would rather live on his knee than die on his foot and therein lie the road to war because those voice do not speak for the rest of we
 you and i know and do not believe that life be so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchase at the price of chain and slavery if nothing in life be worth die for when do this begin just in the face of this enemy or should moses have tell the child of israel to live in slavery under the pharaohs should christ have refuse the cross should the patriot at concord bridge have throw down their gun and refuse to fire the shot hear round the world the martyr of history be not fool and our honor dead who give their life to stop the advance of the nazis do not die in vain where then be the road to peace well it be a simple answer after all
 you and i have the courage to say to our enemy there be a price we will not pay there be a point beyond which they must not advance and this this be the meaning in the phrase of barry goldwater 's peace through strength winston churchill say the destiny of man be not measure by material computation when great force be on the move in the world we learn we be spirit not animal and he say there be something go on in time and space and beyond time and space which whether we like it or not spell duty
 you and i have a rendezvous with destiny
 we will preserve for our child this the last good hope of man on earth or we will sentence they to take the last step into a thousand year of darkness
 we will keep in mind and remember that barry goldwater have faith in we he have faith that you and i have the ability and the dignity and the right to make our own decision and determine our own destiny
 thank you very much

mr. speaker mr. president member of the congress my fellow americans

 on this hill which be my home i be stir by old friendship

 though total agreement between the executive and the congress be impossible total respect be important

 i be proud to be among my colleague of the congress whose legacy to their trust be their loyalty to their nation

 i be not unaware of the inner emotion of the new member of this body tonight

 twenty eight year ago i feel as you do now you will soon learn that you be among man whose first love be their country man who try each day to do as well they can what they believe be right

 we be enter the third century of the pursuit of american union

 two hundred year ago in 1765 nine assemble colony first join together to demand freedom from arbitrary power

 for the first century we struggle to hold together the first continental union of democracy in the history of man one hundred year ago in 1865 follow a terrible test of blood and fire the compact of union be finally seal

 for a second century we labor to establish a unity of purpose and interest among the many group which make up the american community

 that struggle have often bring pain and violence it be not yet over but we have achieve a unity of interest among our people that be unmatched in the history of freedom

 and so tonight now in 1965 we begin a new quest for union we seek the unity of man with the world that he have build with the knowledge that can save or destroy he with the city which can stimulate or stifle he with the wealth and the machine which can enrich or menace his spirit

 we seek to establish a harmony between man and society which will allow each of we to enlarge the meaning of his life and all of we to elevate the quality of our civilization this be the search that we begin tonight

 but the unity we seek can not realize its full promise in isolation for today the state of the union depend in large measure upon the state of the world

 our concern and interest compassion and vigilance extend to every corner of a dwindle planet

 yet it be not merely our concern but the concern of all free man we will not and we should not assume that it be the task of americans alone to settle all the conflict of a torn and troubled world

 let the foe of freedom take no comfort from this for in concert with other nation we shall help man defend their freedom

 our first aim remain the safety and the well being of our own country

 we be prepared to live as good neighbor with all but we can not be indifferent to act design to injure our interest or our citizen or our establishment abroad the community of nation require mutual respect we shall extend it and we shall expect it

 in our relation with the world we shall follow the example of andrew jackson who say i intend to ask for nothing that be not clearly right and to submit to nothing that be wrong and he promise that the honor of my country shall never be stain by an apology from i for the statement of truth or for the performance of duty that be this nation 's policy in the 1830 and that be this nation 's policy in the 1960

 our own freedom and growth have never be the final goal of the american dream

 we be never mean to be an oasis of liberty and abundance in a worldwide desert of disappointed dream our nation be create to help strike away the chain of ignorance and misery and tyranny wherever they keep man less than god mean he to be

 we be move toward that destiny never more rapidly than we have move in the last four year

 in this period we have build a military power strong enough to meet any threat and destroy any adversary and that superiority will continue to grow so long as this office be mine and you sit on capitol hill

 in this period no new nation have become communist and the unity of the communist empire have begin to crumble

 in this period we have resolve in friendship our dispute with our neighbor of the hemisphere and join in an alliance for progress toward economic growth and political democracy

 in this period we have take more step toward peace include the test ban treaty than at any time since the cold war begin

 in this period we have relentlessly pursue our advance toward the conquest of space

 most important of all in this period the united states have reemerge into the fullness of its self confidence and purpose no long be we call upon to get america move we be move no long do we doubt our strength or resolution we be strong and we have prove our resolve

 no long can anyone wonder whether we be in the grip of historical decay we know that history be ours to make and if there be great danger there be now also the excitement of great expectation

 yet we still live in a troubled and perilous world there be no long a single threat there be many they differ in intensity and in danger they require different attitude and different answer

 with the soviet union we seek peaceful understanding that can lessen the danger to freedom

 last fall i ask the american people to choose that course i will carry forward their command

 if we be to live together in peace we must come to know each other well

 i be sure that the american people would welcome a chance to listen to the soviet leader on our television as i would like the soviet people to hear our leader on theirs

 i hope the new soviet leader can visit america so they can learn about our country at firsthand

 in eastern europe restless nation be slowly begin to assert their identity your government assist by the leader in american labor and business be now explore way to increase peaceful trade with these country and with the soviet union i will report our conclusion to the congress

 in asia communism wear a more aggressive face we see that in vietnam why be we there

 we be there first because a friendly nation have ask we for help against the communist aggression ten year ago our president pledge our help three president have support that pledge we will not break it now

 second our own security be tie to the peace of asia twice in one generation we have have to fight against aggression in the far east to ignore aggression now would only increase the danger of a much large war

 our goal be peace in southeast asia that will come only when aggressor leave their neighbor in peace

 what be at stake be the cause of freedom and in that cause america will never be find want

 but communism be not the only source of trouble and unrest there be old and deep source in the misery of nation and in man 's irrepressible ambition for liberty and a well life

 with the free republics of latin america i have always feel and my country have always feel very special tie of interest and affection it will be the purpose of my administration to strengthen these tie together we share and shape the destiny of the new world in the come year i hope to pay a visit to latin america and i will steadily enlarge our commitment to the alliance for progress as the instrument of our war against poverty and injustice in this hemisphere

 in the atlantic community we continue to pursue our goal of 20 year a europe that be grow in strength unity and cooperation with america a great unfinished task be the reunification of germany through self determination

 this european policy be not base on any abstract design it be base on the reality of common interest and common value common danger and common expectation these reality will continue to have their way especially i think in our expand trade and especially in our common defense

 free americans have shape the policy of the united states and because we know these reality those policy have be and will be in the interest of europe

 free europeans must shape the course of europe and for the same reason that course have be and will be in our interest and in the interest of freedom

 i find this truth confirm in my talk with european leader in the last year i hope to repay these visit to some of our friend in europe this year

 in africa and asia we be witness the turbulent unfolding of new nation and continent

 we welcome they to the society of nation

 we be committed to help those seek to strengthen their own independence and to work most closely with those government dedicate to the welfare of all of their people

 we seek not fidelity to an iron faith but a diversity of belief as varied as man himself we seek not to extend the power of america but the progress of humanity we seek not to dominate other but to strengthen the freedom of all people

 i will seek new way to use our knowledge to help deal with the explosion in world population and the grow scarcity in world resource

 finally we renew our commitment to the continue growth and the effectiveness of the united nations the frustration of the united nations be a product of the world that we live in and not of the institution which give they voice it be far well to throw these difference open to the assembly of nation than to permit they to fester in silent danger

 these be some of the goal of the american nation in the world in which we live

 for ourselves we seek neither praise nor blame neither gratitude nor obedience

 we seek peace

 we seek freedom

 we seek to enrich the life of man

 for that be the world in which we will flourish and that be the world that we mean for all man to ultimately have

 world affair will continue to call upon our energy and our courage

 but today we can turn increase attention to the character of american life

 we be in the midst of the great upward surge of economic well being in the history of any nation

 our flourish progress have be mark by price stability that be unequalled in the world our balance of payment deficit have decline and the soundness of our dollar be unquestione i pledge to keep it that way and i urge business and labor to cooperate to that end

 we work for two century to climb this peak of prosperity but we be only at the beginning of the road to the great society ahead now be a summit where freedom from the want of the body can help fulfill the need of the spirit

 we build this nation to serve its people

 we want to grow and build and create but we want progress to be the servant and not the master of man

 we do not intend to live in the midst of abundance isolate from neighbor and nature confine by blighted city and bleak suburb stunt by a poverty of learning and an emptiness of leisure

 the great society ask not how much but how good not only how to create wealth but how to use it not only how fast we be go but where we be head

 it propose as the first test for a nation the quality of its people

 this kind of society will not flower spontaneously from swell rich and surge power

 it will not be the gift of government or the creation of president it will require of every american for many generation both faith in the destination and the fortitude to make the journey

 and like freedom itself it will always be challenge and not fulfillment and tonight we accept that challenge

 i propose that we begin a program in education to ensure every american child the full development of his mind and skill

 i propose that we begin a massive attack on crippling and kill disease

 i propose that we launch a national effort to make the american city a well and a more stimulating place to live

 i propose that we increase the beauty of america and end the poisoning of our river and the air that we breathe

 i propose that we carry out a new program to develop region of our country that be now suffer from distress and depression

 i propose that we make new effort to control and prevent crime and delinquency

 i propose that we eliminate every remain obstacle to the right and the opportunity to vote

 i propose that we honor and support the achievement of thought and the creation of art

 i propose that we make an all out campaign against waste and inefficiency

 our basic task be threefold

 first to keep our economy grow

 to open for all americans the opportunity that be now enjoy by most americans

 and to improve the quality of life for all

 in the next six week i will submit special message with detailed proposal for national action in each of these area

 tonight i would like just briefly to explain some of my major recommendation in the three main area of national need

 first we must keep our nation prosperous we seek full employment opportunity for every american citizen i will present a budget design to move the economy forward more money will be leave in the hand of the consumer by a substantial cut in excise taxis we will continue along the path toward a balanced budget in a balanced economy

 i confidently predict what every economic sign tell we tonight the continue flourish of the american economy

 but we must remember that fear of a recession can contribute to the fact of a recession the knowledge that our government will and can move swiftly will strengthen the confidence of investor and business

 congress can reinforce this confidence by insure that its procedure permit rapid action on temporary income tax cut and special fund for job create public program should be make available for immediate use if recession threaten

 our continued prosperity demand continue price stability business labor and the consumer all have a high stake in keep wage and price within the framework of the guidepost that have already serve the nation so well

 find new market abroad for our good depend on the initiative of american business but we stand ready with credit and other help to assist the flow of trade which will benefit the entire nation

 our economy owe much to the efficiency of our farmer we must continue to assure they the opportunity to earn a fair reward i have instruct the secretary of agriculture to lead a major effort to find new approach to reduce the heavy cost of our farm program and to direct more of our effort to the small farmer who need the help the most

 we can help insure continued prosperity through

 a regional recovery program to assist the development of stricken area leave behind by our national progress

 further effort to provide our worker with the skill demand by modern technology for the labor man be an indispensable force in the american system

 the extension of the minimum wage to more than two million unprotected worker

 the improvement and the modernization of the unemployment compensation system

 and as pledge in our 1960 and 1964 democratic platform i will propose to congress change in the taft hartley act include section 14(b i will do so hope to reduce the conflict that for several year have divide americans in various states of our union

 in a country that span a continent modern transportation be vital to continue growth

 i will recommend heavy reliance on competition in transportation and a new policy for our merchant marine

 i will ask for fund to study high speed rail transportation between urban center we will begin with test project between washington and boston on high speed train passenger could travel this distance in less than four hour

 second we must open opportunity to all our people

 most americans enjoy a good life but far too many be still trap in poverty and idleness and fear

 let a just nation throw open to they the city of promise

 to the elderly by provide hospital care under social security and by raise benefit payment to those struggle to maintain the dignity of their later year

 to the poor and the unfortunate through double the war against poverty this year

 to negro americans through enforcement of the civil right law and elimination of barrier to the right to vote

 to those in other land that be seek the promise of america through an immigration law base on the work a man can do and not where he be bear or how he spell his name

 our third goal be to improve the quality of american life

 we begin with learn

 every child must have the good education that this nation can provide

 thomas jefferson say that no nation can be both ignorant and free today no nation can be both ignorant and great

 in addition to our exist program i will recommend a new program for school and student with a first year authorization of $ 1,500 million

 it will help at every stage along the road to learn

 for the preschool year we will help needy child become aware of the excitement of learn

 for the primary and secondary school year we will aid public school serve low income family and assist student in both public and private school

 for the college year we will provide scholarship to high school student of the great promise and the great need and we will guarantee low interest loan to student continue their college study

 new laboratory and center will help our school help they lift their standard of excellence and explore new method of teaching these center will provide special training for those who need and those who deserve special treatment

 greatness require not only an educate people but a healthy people

 our goal be to match the achievement of our medicine to the affliction of our people

 we already carry on a large program in this country for research and health

 in addition regional medical center can provide the most advanced diagnosis and treatment for heart disease and cancer and stroke and other major disease

 new support for medical and dental education will provide the train people to apply our knowledge

 community center can help the mentally ill and improve health care for school age child from poor family include service for the mentally retarded

 an educated and healthy people require surrounding in harmony with their hope in our urban area the central problem today be to protect and restore man 's satisfaction in belong to a community where he can find security and significance

 the first step be to break old pattern to begin to think and work and plan for the development of the entire metropolitan area we will take this step with new program of help for the basic community facility and for neighborhood center of health and recreation

 new and exist program will be open to those city which work together to develop unified long range policy for metropolitan area

 we must also make some very important change in our housing program if we be to pursue these same basic goal

 so a department of housing and urban development will be need to spearhead this effort in our city

 every citizen have the right to feel secure in his home and on the street of his community

 to help control crime we will recommend program

 to train local law enforcement officer

 to put the good technique of modern science at their disposal

 to discover the cause of crime and well way to prevent it

 i will soon assemble a panel of outstanding expert of this nation to search out answer to the national problem of crime and delinquency and i welcome the recommendation and the constructive effort of the congress

 for over three century the beauty of america have sustain our spirit and have enlarge our vision we must act now to protect this heritage in a fruitful new partnership with the state and the city the next decade should be a conservation milestone we must make a massive effort to save the countryside and to establish as a green legacy for tomorrow more large and small park more seashore and open space than have be create during any other period in our national history

 a new and substantial effort must be make to landscape highway to provide place of relaxation and recreation wherever our road run

 within our city imaginative program be need to landscape street and to transform open area into place of beauty and recreation

 we will seek legal power to prevent pollution of our air and water before it happen we will step up our effort to control harmful waste give first priority to the cleanup of our most contaminate river we will increase research to learn much more about the control of pollution

 we hope to make the potomac a model of beauty here in the capital and preserve unspoiled stretch of some of our waterway with a wild rivers bill

 more idea for a beautiful america will emerge from a white house conference on natural beauty which i will soon call

 we must also recognize and encourage those who can be pathfinder for the nation 's imagination and understanding

 to help promote and honor creative achievement i will propose a national foundation on the arts

 to develop knowledge which will enrich our life and ensure our progress i will recommend program to encourage basic science particularly in the university and to bring close the day when the ocean will supply our grow need for fresh water

 for government to serve these goal it must be modern in structure efficient in action and ready for any emergency

 i be busy currently review the structure of the entire executive branch of this government i hope to reshape it and to reorganize it to meet more effectively the task of the 20th century

 wherever waste be find i will eliminate it

 last year we save almost $ 3,500 million by eliminate waste in the national government

 and i intend to do well this year

 and very soon i will report to you on our progress and on new economy that your government plan to make

 even the good of government be subject to the bad of hazard

 i will propose law to insure the necessary continuity of leadership should the president become disabled or die

 in addition i will propose reform in the electoral college leave undisturbed the vote by state but make sure that no elector can substitute his will for that of the people

 last year in a sad moment i come here and i speak to you after 33 year of public service practically all of they here on this hill

 this year i speak after one year as president of the united states

 many of you in this chamber be among my old friend we have share many happy moment and many hour of work and we have watch many president together yet only in the white house can you finally know the full weight of this office

 the great burden be not run the huge operation of government or meet daily trouble large and small or even work with the congress

 a president 's hard task be not to do what be right but to know what be right

 yet the presidency bring no special gift of prophecy or foresight you take an oath you step into an office and you must then help guide a great democracy

 the answer be wait for i in the land where i be bear

 it be once barren land the angular hill be cover with scrub cedar and a few large live oak little would grow in that harsh caliche soil of my country and each spring the pedernales river would flood our valley

 but man come and they work and they endure and they build

 and tonight that country be abundant abundant with fruit and cattle and goat and sheep and there be pleasant home and lake and the flood be go

 why do man come to that once forbid land

 well they be restless of course and they have to be move on but there be more than that there be a dream a dream of a place where a free man could build for himself and raise his child to a well life a dream of a continent to be conquer a world to be win a nation to be make

 remember this i know the answer

 a president do not shape a new and personal vision of america

 he collect it from the scatter hope of the american past

 it exist when the first settler see the coast of a new world and when the first pioneer move westward

 it have guide we every step of the way

 it sustain every president but it be also your inheritance and it belong equally to all the people that we all serve

 it must be interpret anew by each generation for its own need as i have try in part to do tonight

 it shall lead we as we enter the third century of the search for a more perfect union

 this then be the state of the union free and restless grow and full of hope

 so it be in the beginning

 so it shall always be while god be willing and we be strong enough to keep the faith

my fellow countryman
 on this occasion the oath i have take before you and before god be not mine alone but our together we be one nation and one people our fate as a nation and our future as a people rest not upon one citizen but upon all citizen
 that be the majesty and the meaning of this moment
 for every generation there be a destiny for some history decide for this generation the choice must be our own
 even now a rocket move toward mars it remind we that the world will not be the same for our child or even for ourselves in a short span of year the next man to stand here will look out on a scene that be different from our own
 ours be a time of change rapid and fantastic change bear the secret of nature multiply the nation place in uncertain hand new weapon for mastery and destruction shake old value and uproot old way
 our destiny in the midst of change will rest on the unchanged character of our people and on their faith
 they come here the exile and the stranger brave but frightened to find a place where a man could be his own man they make a covenant with this land conceive in justice write in liberty bind in union it be mean one day to inspire the hope of all mankind and it bind we still if we keep its term we shall flourish
 first justice be the promise that all who make the journey would share in the fruit of the land
 in a land of great wealth family must not live in hopeless poverty in a land rich in harvest child just must not go hungry in a land of heal miracle neighbor must not suffer and die untended in a great land of learning and scholar young people must be teach to read and write
 for more than 30 year that i have serve this nation i have believe that this injustice to our people this waste of our resource be our real enemy for 30 year or more with the resource i have have i have vigilantly fight against it i have learn and i know that it will not surrender easily
 but change have give we new weapon before this generation of americans be finish this enemy will not only retreat it will be conquer
 justice require we to remember when any citizen deny his fellow say his color be not mine or his belief be strange and different in that moment he betray america though his forebear create this nation
 liberty be the second article of our covenant it be self government it be our bill of rights but it be more america would be a place where each man could be proud to be himself stretch his talent rejoice in his work important in the life of his neighbor and his nation
 this have become more difficult in a world where change and growth seem to tower beyond the control and even the judgment of man we must work to provide the knowledge and the surrounding which can enlarge the possibility of every citizen
 the american covenant call on we to help show the way for the liberation of man and that be today our goal thus if as a nation there be much outside our control as a people no stranger be outside our hope
 change have bring new meaning to that old mission we can never again stand aside prideful in isolation terrific danger and trouble that we once call foreign now constantly live among we if american life must end and american treasure be spill in country that we barely know then that be the price that change have demand of conviction and of our endure covenant
 think of our world as it look from that rocket that be head toward mars it be like a child 's globe hang in space the continent stick to its side like colored map we be all fellow passenger on a dot of earth and each of we in the span of time have really only a moment among our companion
 how incredible it be that in this fragile existence we should hate and destroy one another there be possibility enough for all who will abandon mastery over other to pursue mastery over nature there be world enough for all to seek their happiness in their own way
 our nation 's course be abundantly clear we aspire to nothing that belong to other we seek no dominion over our fellow man but man 's dominion over tyranny and misery
 but more be require man want to be part of a common enterprise a cause great than themselves and each of we must find a way to advance the purpose of the nation thus find new purpose for ourselves without this we will simply become a nation of stranger
 the third article be union to those who be small and few against the wilderness the success of liberty demand the strength of union two century of change have make this true again
 no long need capitalist and worker farmer and clerk city and countryside struggle to divide our bounty by work shoulder to shoulder together we can increase the bounty of all we have discover that every child who learn and every man who find work and every sick body that be make whole like a candle add to an altar brighten the hope of all the faithful
 so let we reject any among we who seek to reopen old wound and rekindle old hatred they stand in the way of a seek nation
 let we now join reason to faith and action to experience to transform our unity of interest into a unity of purpose for the hour and the day and the time be here to achieve progress without strife to achieve change without hatred not without difference of opinion but without the deep and abide division which scar the union for generation
 under this covenant of justice liberty and union we have become a nation prosperous great and mighty and we have keep our freedom but we have no promise from god that our greatness will endure we have be allow by he to seek greatness with the sweat of our hand and the strength of our spirit
 i do not believe that the great society be the ordered changeless and sterile battalion of the ant it be the excitement of become always become try probe fall rest and try again but always try and always gain
 in each generation with toil and tear we have have to earn our heritage again if we fail now then we will have forget in abundance what we learn in hardship that democracy rest on faith that freedom ask more than it give and the judgment of god be harsh on those who be most favor
 if we succeed it will not be because of what we have but it will be because of what we be not because of what we own but rather because of what we believe
 for we be a nation of believer underneath the clamor of building and the rush of our day 's pursuit we be believer in justice and liberty and in our own union we believe that every man must some day be free and we believe in ourselves
 and that be the mistake that our enemy have always make in my lifetime in depression and in war they have await our defeat each time from the secret place of the american heart come forth the faith that they could not see or that they could not even imagine and it bring we victory and it will again
 for this be what america be all about it be the uncrossed desert and the unclimbed ridge it be the star that be not reach and the harvest that be sleep in the unplowed ground be our world go we say farewell be a new world come we welcome it and we will bend it to the hope of man
 and to these trust public servant and to my family and those close friend of mine who have follow i down a long wind road and to all the people of this union and the world i will repeat today what i say on that sorrowful day in november last year i will lead and i will do the good i can
 but you you must look within your own heart to the old promise and to the old dream they will lead you good of all
 for myself i ask only in the word of an ancient leader give i now wisdom and knowledge that i may go out and come in before this people for who can judge this thy people that be so great

today i be send to the congress my agricultural message it be a message for all farmer and rancher both large and small it be a message for all of rural america

 in the texas of my boyhood farming be the backbone of our economy this message that i be send to congress today make it very clear that the farmer and the agricultural community be still most important in the american way of life

 but this message be not only for our nation 's farmer and those who live in our rural area this be a message for all americans who benefit from our unparalleled harvest of plenty

 food today be our good bargain it be right and it be proper that a grateful nation should properly reward those who make possible the food that sustain we all

 in this message today i make the following recommendation

 first the appointment of a blue ribbon commission of americans to assist in adapt our farm program to the need of tomorrow and the 20th century i will ask this commission to conduct a fundamental examination of the entire agricultural policy of the united states of america

 second i be take step to assure that benefit of federal program be distribute fairly between the urban and the rural area

 third i be propose new loan for rural area for well housing at low budget cost

 fourth i be recommend that we continue price and income support program which be necessary to prevent a catastrophic decline in our farm income

 fifth we will begin a long term land use program which will help achieve the good use of our land at the least possible cost

 sixth we will take increase step to find new market abroad for our farm product secretary freeman have just this week return from europe where he have be in that interest

 agriculture be one of our good dollar producer in the foreign market it be the number one export in the american economy

 this message that i have send to congress recognize the great importance of an agricultural economy depression and recession be usually farm lead and farm fed

 during the week and month ahead detail of our program for agricultural and rural america will be present it be my earnest hope that these program will permit we to travel far down the road toward our goal of parity income for american agriculture and parity of opportunity for rural america

 last week the house of representatives adopt a proposal that would if bring into law by add an amendment on the appropriation bill prevent the united states of america from carry out a 30 year agreement that we have make with the united arab republic this agreement be to sell surplus commodity to the united arab republic under what be call tide i of public law 480

 yesterday the senate pass a milder version of this proposal and moderate the house amendment it would permit delivery of surplus commodity if the president determine it to be in the national interest

 i judge it of the high importance that the flexibility provide the president by the senate version be sustain by the congress i hope the house of representatives will accept the improvement make by the senate committee and vote by the senate because if we be to protect our vital interest in this part of the world where tension be very high then the president must have freedom of action to act in the good interest of all the people of this land

 it be of course obvious that the relation between the united states and the united arab republic must be improve it will demand effort from both country

 i can not predict whether improvement can be achieve but if we be to have any degree of success in this sensitive relationship the president must have some freedom of action i earnestly suggest to the congress that they consider this need which i believe be truly in the good interest of all of our people and be not in any manner a partisan matter as demonstrate by the very fine speech make by the minority leader senator dirksen yesterday on another matter i should like to say that all americans should be indignant when one american be deny the right to vote the loss of that right to a single citizen undermine the freedom of every citizen this be why all of we should be concern with the effort of our fellow americans to register to vote in alabama

 the basic problem in selma be the slow pace of vote registration for negroes who be qualified to vote we be use the tool of the civil rights act of 1964 in an effort to secure their right to vote one of those tool of course be legal action to guarantee a citizen his right

 one case of voting discrimination have already lead to a trial which have just be conclude we be now await a decision in this case in the meantime i hope that all americans will join with i in express their concern over the loss of any american 's right to vote nothing be more fundamental to american citizenship and to our freedom as a nation and as a people i intend to see that that right be secure for all of our citizen

 i have plan to make these statement for the newsreel and recording and i inform mr. reedy while i be here i would be glad to take any question that might flow from they or any other question on any subject that might interest you

 q. mr. president last night sir you hold out the prospect of an exchange of visit with the soviet leader this year could you tell we in any firm detail how far discussion have go or what the timing might be

 the president no i think the statement i make last night be make in the light of the information we have at the moment and the judgment that we have exercise i say that i have reason to believe that the reason to believe be base upon discussion that have take place between the representative of the government of the united states and the soviet union the detail of the exchange will be make public as soon as they be definite

 q. mr. president general de gaulle have make a suggestion to hold a 5 power conference include red china and to discuss possible change in the united nations would you comment on that please

 the president i have only see the very brief press report regard general de gaulle 's conference which apparently have just conclude before this meeting and i would much prefer to await a full report on the exact statement before get into any detailed discussion involve the general 's observation

 it be the position of this country however we believe that the problem of the united nations be traceable not to the united nations charter but to those country which have violate either the spirit or the letter of the charter because we believe that the framework for world progress and peace be in the charter and i will be glad to respectfully review any observation the general have make and give due consideration to they

 mr. president there have be some criticism both abroad and here because vice president humphrey be not send to london to the churchill funeral would you care to go into your reason and what motivate you in select the american delegation

 the president well at first i think i would hope that i would be able to go if my physical condition permit i ask that we defer final decision until the doctor could act but i have my staff contact president truman and president eisenhower and express the hope they could accompany i president truman be unable to go and president eisenhower inform we that he have accept the invitation of the family and he would be go and that he would be in attendance and would be do other thing there

 i urge that he go with we in our delegation and send a plane to california to pick he up at the same time i personally call the chief justice and ask if he would agree to go with i in case we make the trip i also be inform we have senator fulbright the chairman of the foreign relations committee and senator hickenlooper the ranking republican of that committee and eight other senators in london at the time some of whom would be pay their respect as representative of this country

 i feel that with the former president with the chief justice of the united states supreme court with the distinguished ambassador of this country to the united kingdom that we have a good delegation and a high rank delegation

 i have no particular reason for not ask the vice president to go although the vice president as you may or may not have observe be address the delegate from 50 state at noon the day the plane leave at 7:30 in the morning on his new responsibility in the field of civil right

 i be glad to have the press reaction and the reaction abroad on the protocol involve in connection with funeral i have serve as vice president for 3 year and it have never occur to i and i have never have it bring to my attention so vividly that it be the duty and the function of the vice president to be present at all official funeral

 on occasion during the 3 year i be vice president i attend one or two funeral represent this country but there be many representative from many walk of life i do review the list of delegate represent their country at the churchill funeral and i do not observe that other nation send in most instance either their top man or the next man necessarily

 i think we have a rather well round delegation in the former president the secretary of state the senators who be present the chief justice of our supreme court

 in the light of your interest and other interest i may have make a mistake by ask the chief justice to go and not ask the vice president i will bear in mind in connection with any future funeral your very strong feeling in the matter and try to act in accordance with our national interest

 q. mr. president since your last news conference there have be a considerable number of development in viet nam mr. bundy be currently there i wonder if you could speak generally to we about viet nam and your attitude toward these late development

 the president yes there have be no change in the position of this country in regard to our desire or our determination to help the people of viet nam preserve their freedom i frequently observe to the people of this country that our basic commitment to viet nam be make in a statement 10 year ago by our president to the general effect that we would help the people of viet nam help themselves

 now we have difficulty from day to day and sometimes they increase with the hour and we have mr. bundy out in viet nam now on a regular exchange of view with our spokesman and our representative in that area normally about every 6 week or 2 month we ask our ambassador and our military adviser to bring we a full exchange of view general taylor be here i believe in july and again in september and maybe in december and he be due to come back here in february

 in the light of the recent development out there he think that it would be well if mr. bundy come out there at this particular time than for he to take the time out for a trip back to the united states

 so in accordance with his suggestion i recommend that mr. bundy go there and that general taylor bring he up to date on the military situation in that country on the political situation in that country and give we his view as to what our course should be in try to continue to be more effective and efficient in aid the people of viet nam to preserve their freedom

 mr. bundy will be back on the weekend he no doubt will bring with he all the information that be available to our people and i will be glad to make as much of that information available as be in the national interest

 i only want to reassert this morning our determination to continue our present policy the policy of our government from the beginning to try to help the people of viet nam help themselves to preserve their freedom

 q. mr. president in this connection sir you have address yourself to the political and military situation of viet nam but the diplomatic situation there seem to have turn some corner with the announcement that mr. kosygin be go to hanoi i wonder sir could you assess for we the possible significance of that visit in term both of our commitment to south viet nam and in term of the broad effect on east west relation

 the president the kosygin visit and its implication and its significance could well be interpret by mr. kosygin our visit to south viet nam be require by our regular practice of exchange view every 6 week or 2 month it have nothing whatever to do with the kosygin visit it be plan before we have information of the kosygin visit

 what the purpose of mr. kosygin and what the result of his visit to peiping or hanoi will be be unknown to i at this time we will have to await development to see what flow from those meeting

 q. mr. president as i understand it we be in south viet nam at the invitation and request of the south vietnamese government yesterday there be a dispatch from paris say that north vietnamese and south vietnamese official be explore behind the scene the possibility of a negotiate settlement what happen if we be invite to leave south viet nam by the south vietnamese government

 the president i would not anticipate that we would receive such an invitation i would comment only on the dispatch that come from unknown and unauthorized and i rather think uninformed source in paris in my judgment that dispatch have no validity and like a good many be completely untrue

 i believe that we will continue as i say before to do our very good to make our effort in viet nam more efficient and more effective in help the people of viet nam to help themselves i would not want to speculate on what might be it- this situation happen or that situation happen i would want to cross that bridge when i come to it but i do not anticipate cross any such bridge as be indicate by the dispatch from paris

 q. do that mean sir that you be oppose to the suggestion of the senators of your own party notably senator gore and mr. church recommend the exploration of a negotiate settlement

 the president it mean that my position i think be abundantly clear that we be there to be as effective and efficient as we can in help the people of south viet nam resist aggression and preserve their freedom you will find from time to time that senator from both the democratic and the republican parties will have different viewpoint to which they be entitle and they will express they as i have express mine

 q. mr. president sir have you give any consideration to modify your order on the closing of veteran hospital in light of the congressional opposition

 the president yes i give a good deal of consideration to the action of the veterans administration in close the installation that they recommend be close in the interest of saving and economy and the interest of the veteran themselves

 this recommendation be first make by mr. gleason who have serve many year as administrator of veterans affairs mr. gleason 's recommendation be send to the appropriate people in the budget bureau and they study they and agree with mr. gleason and refer they to the president with their view

 upon the receipt of those recommendation i carefully study they and send they to the new veterans administrator mr. driver for his study and consideration and any action that he care to take

 mr. driver make a very careful study of each of the installation and make rather full recommendation back through the appropriate official in the budget bureau they forward mr. driver 's recommendation back to the white house and i ask an independent attorney one of very judicious temperament and a good many year experience in handle public property and land and installation to make an independent study of each of the installation and each of the consolidation

 he prepare for i a memorandum in which he concur in mr. gleason 's recommendation in mr. driver 's recommendation in the director of the budget 's recommendation and he say that the public interest require that the veterans administrator take the action that he propose to take

 i have hear from most of the representative of the community involve i have hear from a good many of the people who live in those community we recognize the economic impact of the closing of these installation and the hardship that it bring in some instance we be do what we can to minimize that hardship

 we do not feel that we be justify in take the taxpayer money to support a hospital that in many instance the people feel should not have be so locate to begin with in some instance be not modern in other instance the head of the medical facility of the veterans administration urge that they never he establish to begin with because they could not attract outstanding military and professional medical people

 and it be our judgment that we be not justify in pay $ 5 or $ 6 a day more to keep veteran service connect or non service connect in one of these small hospital when he could get the good modern medicine available at a much cheap cost in a hospital in the area

 now congress may have a different viewpoint i have observe that they have ask we to permit the independent offices committee of the senate appropriations committee to look far into it the chairman of the house veterans committee be consult before we take this action and he propose to make a close study of it now in the house as they have do in the senate we will of course supply all the information we have and we will receive all the information that anyone else have to offer and we will always be glad to give it consideration

 but the judgment we have make insofar as we can now determine be make on the good fact available and we do not believe that the national interest of all of our people justify the waste that will occur if we satisfy the narrow local requirement as desirable as they may be to the local community they do not necessarily serve the national interest

 q. mr. president can you tell we what the doctor report on your health since your illness last week

 the president they take my blood pressure practically every morning they look at my throat the comment now be they think i be do very well and most of the symptom of the infection i have be go although i do not feel as bouncy as i do before i go to the hospital i be put in a rather full day these day i have a bowl of soup in my office for lunch yesterday and work until i go to the meeting last night and have my dinner after i return i be reasonably well catch up with my work and i feel in good shape

 i would be glad to have you if you have any specific request that you want to pursue talk to dr. burkley about it he would be glad to give it to you he see i every day

 q. mr. president the senate rules committee make a report state that bobby baker be involve in gross impropriety that be the official report and early you indicate you want to wait until the committee finish at least a report

 the president no i never indicate i want to wait for the senate i say that be a matter for the senate and that be what i would repeat

 q. mr. president in light of president kennedy 's much state view that he think the moral leadership on these ethical question should come from the white house i wonder if you would like to give we your opinion now on bobby baker when he be your assistant and the time afterward

 the president no i would not care to make a comment about a matter that be under investigation in a senate committee and be be thoroughly study by a local grand jury i have state at various time that the question have be raise that i think that this be a matter for the senate to study and if there have be any violation of the law for the grand jury and the fbi and the department of justice to take appropriate action

 now i have refer to the fbi any and all information of a substantive nature that have come to my attention in this regard that information be be present to the grand jury and be be or have be or will be present to the committee and i think the committee will draw its own conclusion and i have no doubt but what the grand jury will act appropriately in the matter

 q. mr. president to go back to the viet nam situation do you consider that the american national interest be limit only to the fulfilling of the commitment that you speak of

 the president no i do not intend to prelude i do not intend to narrow our interest in the matter i intend to make abundantly clear that we have make a commitment to help these people help themselves and we intend to abide by it

 q. do you consider as some people do that there be a large national interest in the sense that the war in viet nam be part of an effort to contain chinese expansionism in asia

 the president i think that the effort in viet nam be an effort to help liberty love people preserve their freedom and realize how much we appreciate those who help we to obtain ours that we want to help everyone we can preserve theirs and our purpose there be to help the people of south viet nam preserve their freedom and we be do all we can to do that

 q. mr. president do this constitute recognition of the present government of south viet nam or be those some of the matter that be still be look at

 the president i do not think that that be a question we be deal with at the moment we be work with the exist government as we have be right along we will be exchange view with the spokesman for the people of south viet nam through ambassador taylor and mr. johnson and mr. bundy.6

 6 gen. maxwell d. taylor u.s. ambassador to viet nam u. alexis johnson deputy u.s. ambassador to viet nam and mcgeorge bundy special assistant to the president for national security affairs

the president good afternoon lady and gentleman

 this march week have bring a very deep and painful challenge to the unende search for american freedom

 that challenge be not yet over but before it be end every resource of this government will be direct to insure justice for all man of all race in alabama and everywhere in this land that be the meaning of the oath that i swear before almighty god when i take the office of the presidency that be what i believe in with all of my heart that be what the people of this country demand

 last sunday a group of negro americans in selma alabama attempt peacefully to protest the denial of the most basic political right of all the right to vote they be attack and some be brutally beat

 from that moment until this we have act effectively to protect the constitutional right of the citizen of selma and to prevent further violence and lawlessness in this country wherever it occur

 more than 70 united states government official include fbi agent include justice department lawyer governor collins the assistant attorney general mr. john doar whom i ask to go to selma have be continuously present in selma they have all be work to keep the peace and to enforce the law

 at all time the full power of the federal government have be ready to protect the people of selma against further lawlessness

 but the final answer to this problem will be find not in armed confrontation but in the process of law we have act to bring this conflict from the street to the courtroom your government at my direction ask the federal court in alabama to order the law official of alabama not to interfere with american citizen who be peacefully demonstrate for their constitutional right

 when the court have make its order it must be obey

 the event of last sunday can not and will not be repeat but the demonstration in selma have a much large meaning they be a protest against a deep and very unjust flaw in american democracy itself

 ninety five year ago our constitution be amend to require that no american be deny the right to vote because of race or color almost a century later many americans be keep from vote simply because they be negro

 therefore this monday i will send to the congress a request for legislation to carry out the amendment of the constitution

 wherever there be discrimination this law will strike down all restriction use to deny the people the right to vote it will establish a simple uniform standard which can not be use however ingenuous the effort to flaunt our constitution if state official refuse to cooperate then citizen will be register by federal official

 this law be not an effort to punish or coerce anyone its object be one which no american in his heart can truly reject it be to give all our people the right to choose their leader to deny this right i think be to deny democracy itself

 what happen in selma be an american tragedy the blow that be receive the blood that be shed the life of the good man that be lose must strengthen the determination of each of we to bring full and equal and exact justice to all of our people

 this be not just the policy of your government or your president it be in the heart and the purpose and the meaning of america itself

 we all know how complex and how difficult it be to bring about basic social change in a democracy but this complexity must not obscure the clear and simple moral issue

 it be wrong to do violence to peaceful citizen in the street of their town it be wrong to deny americans the right to vote it be wrong to deny any person full equality because of the color of his skin

 the promise of america be a simple promise every person shall share in the blessing of this land and they shall share on the basis of their merit as a person they shall not be judge by their color or by their belief or by their religion or by where they be bear or the neighborhood in which they live

 all my life i have see america move close toward that goal and every step of the way have bring enlarge opportunity and more happiness for all of our people

 those who do injustice be as surely the victim of their own act as the people that they wrong they scar their own life and they scar the community in which they live by turn from hatred to understanding they can insure a rich and full life for themselves as well as for their fellow for if we put aside disorder and violence if we put aside hatred and lawlessness we can provide for all our people great opportunity almost beyond our imagination

 we will continue this battle for human dignity we will apply all the resource of this great and powerful government to this task we ask that all of our citizen unite in this hour of trial we will not be move by anyone or anything from the path of justice

 in this task we will seek the help of the divine power which surpass the petty barrier between man and man and people and people under his guidance we can seek the biblical promise i shall light a candle of understanding in thine heart which shall not be put out and we will follow that light until all of we have bow to the command let there be no strife between i and thee for we be brother

 i meet today with governor wallace of alabama to discuss very thoroughly the situation that exist in that state

 the governor express his concern that the demonstration which have take place be a threat to the peace and security of the people of alabama i express my own concern about the need for remedy those grievance which lead to the demonstration by people who feel their right have be deny

 i say that those negro citizen of alabama who have systematically be deny the right to register and to participate in the choice of those who govern they should be provide the opportunity of direct national attention to their plight they feel that they be be deny a very precious right and i understand their concern

 in his telegram last night to i governor wallace express his belief that all eligible citizen be entitle to exercise their right to vote he repeat that belief today and he state that he be against any discrimination in that regard

 i be firmly convinced as i say to the governor a few moment ago that when all of the eligible negroes of alabama have be register the economic and the social injustice they have experience throughout will be right and the demonstration i believe will stop

 i advise the governor of my intention to press with all the vigor at my command to assure that every citizen of this country be give the right to participate in his government at every level through the complete voting process

 the governor 's express interest in law and order meet with a warm response we be a nation that be govern by law and our procedure for enact and amend and repeal these law must prevail

 i tell the governor that we believe in maintain law and order in every county and in every precinct in this land if state and local authority be unable to function the federal government will completely meet its responsibility

 i tell the governor that the brutality in selma last sunday just must not be repeat he agree that he abhor brutality and regret any instance in which any american citizen meet with violence

 as the governor have indicate his desire to take action to remedy the exist situation in alabama which cause people to demonstrate i respectfully suggest to he that he consider the following action which i believe and the attorney general and other familiar with the matter and associate with i believe would be highly constructive at this stage of the game

 first i urge that the governor publicly declare his support for universal suffrage in the state of alabama and the united states of america

 second i urge he to assure that the right of peaceful assembly will be permit in alabama so long as law and order be maintain

 third i express the hope that the governor would call a biracial meeting when he return to alabama to seek great cooperation and to ask for great unity among americans of both race

 i ask the governor for his cooperation and i express my appreciation for his come to washington to discuss this problem

 q. mr. president against the background of what you say and aside from the situation in selma i wonder if you could tell we your general philosophy your belief in how demonstrator in other part of the country should conduct themselves for example how do you feel about the demonstration that be go on outside the white house right now or in other part in other city of the united states and in front of federal building

 the president i try to cover that in my statement but i believe in the right of peaceful assembly i believe that people have the right to demonstrate i think that you must be concern with the right of other

 i do not think a person as have be say have the right to holler fire in a crowded theater but i think that people should have the right to peacefully assemble to picket to demonstrate their view and to do anything they can to bring those view to the attention of people provide they do not violate law themselves and provide they conduct themselves as they should

 q. mr. president do governor wallace indicate sir at all an area of understanding and cooperation and acceptance of some of your suggestion to solve this violence there

 the president i will have to let the governor speak for himself he be go to appear tomorrow we speak very frankly and very forthrightly we exchange view and we be not in agreement on a good many thing i be hopeful that the visit will be helpful and i do my good to make my viewpoint clear

 q. mr. president i be go to ask you how the governor react

 the president the governor have his share of the conversation he tell i of the problem that he have in alabama the fear that he entertain and he express the hope that i could do something to help bring the demonstration to an end

 i tell he very frankly that i think our problem which i have be work on for several week now be to face up to the cause of the demonstration and remove the cause of the demonstration and that i hope if he would give assurance that people would be protect in their demonstration in alabama he would give assurance that he would try to improve the voting situation in alabama if i could submit my message to the congress and get prompt action on it that would insure the right of the people of alabama to vote that i think that we could improve the demonstration situation

 q. mr. president a two part question on the same subject

 can you tell we what your thinking be if governor wallace would not accept any or all of your suggestion and secondly in announce from montgomery that he have ask to see you he indicate that he be concerned about a threat throughout the country do you share that concern

 the president i be deeply concerned that our citizen anywhere should be discriminate against and should be deny their constitutional right

 i have plot my course i have state my view i have make clear whether the governor agree or not that law and order will prevail in alabama that people will be their right to peacefully assemble will be preserve and that their constitutional right will be protect

 q. mr. president some of the clergyman who come out yesterday report that you have detect a resurgence of a moderate spirit among the white in the south can you tell we what evidence you have see of that and perhaps anything that be be do to encourage it

 the president the presence of a good many people from the south in selma the presence of some of the minister from the south here the message that i have receive from the citizen of that area the support that the businessman and the clergy and the labor people have give the civil rights act and its enforcement have all give i strength and comfort and encouragement

 q. mr. president i would like to turn to the other problem that have occupy so much of your hour in viet nam about 5 week ago when you feel it necessary to give an order that our wife and child of our man in viet nam be withdraw a high officer say to i give we a year and they will be back i have two question

 first would you like to see the wife and child of our civilian and military officer in viet nam go back and secondly do you think that a year be a good prognostication

 the president no i do not think that i can be much of a prophet in either respect first i do not think that saigon be the place for the wife and child of our military people at the moment or else i would not ask for they to come out if the situation change and condition be different i will pass on they in the light of those change

 i think that anyone that make a prophecy now as to what the situation will be a year from now would have to be a big guesser

 q. mr. president sir i would like to change the subject to another matter mr. otto otepka a top security officer in the state department face dismissal for answer the question of some members of congress who be investigate the security of the united states i would like to know if you can not stop this dismissal

 the president i have have some conversation with secretary rusk concern that case and i have complete confidence in the manner in which he will handle it

 q. mr. president in the last 5 week the american participation in the situation in south viet nam have undergo certain change could you give we your view of any benefit that have accrue to we or your view of the situation over the past 5 week in south viet nam

 the president i think we have a very difficult situation there as a result of the instability of the government and the frequent change of they i would not say it have improve in the last 5 week

 i would say that our policy there be the policy that be establish by president eisenhower as i have state since i have be president 46 different time the policy carry on by president kennedy and the policy that we be now carry on i have state it as recently as february 17th in some detail and prior to that in my last press conference on february 4th although the incident have change in some instance the equipment have change in some instance the tactic and perhaps the strategy in a decision or two have change

 our policy be still the same and that be to any armed attack our force will reply to any in southeast asia who ask our help in defend their freedom we be go to give it and that mean we be go to continue to give it in that region there be nothing that we covet there be nothing we seek there be no territory or no military position or no political ambition our one desire and our one determination be that the people of southeast asia be leave in peace to work out their own destiny in their own way

 q. mr. president there be a report publish this morning that some federal troop have already be alert at your direction for a possible move into alabama can you confirm this report

 the president i would say that the fbi official the marshal in the general area the united states force include the armed forces be ready to carry out any instruction that the president give they and the president be prepared to give they any instruction that be necessary and justified and wise

 q. mr. president i wonder if you could tell we your reaction to the pressure that have be mount around the world for you to negotiate the situation in viet nam could you explain to we under what condition you might be willing to negotiate a settlement there

 the president well since the geneva conference of 1962 as have be state before the united states have be in rather active and continuous consultation we have talk to other government about the great danger that we could foresee in this aggression in southeast asia we have discuss it in the united nations we have discuss it in nato we have discuss it in the seato council on innumerable occasion we have discuss it directly through diplomatic channel we have have direct discussion with almost every signatory of the 1954 and the 1962 pact

 we have not have any indication and as the secretary of state say the other day what be still miss be any indication any indication from anyone that hanoi be prepared or willing or ready to stop do what it be do against its neighbor i think that the absence of this crucial element affect the current discussion of negotiation

 a great friend of mine who have great responsibility for a long period of military and executive life in our government say to i the other day when i see the suggestion about negotiation i wonder if folk do not recognize that there must be someone to negotiate with and there must be someone willing to negotiate

 q. i say sir that the event in selma occur last sunday and i ask why you wait to have a press conference and make a statement until late saturday afternoon

 the president i know of nothing that either require or justify my make a statement prior to the time that i have a recommendation to make on the problem that be face we namely they be demonstrate about vote right and i have that message deliver to i only a few hour ago i have review it and be in general agreement on what i be go to send to the congress it happen that i have the time this afternoon to review it and have the information that be available to i

 i think the president should have some leeway when he determine to have press conference i have have 46 since i have be president i plan to have at least one once a month but the president will determine when they be hold where they be hold and what subject he discuss

 q. mr. president i understand that there have be some violence in the youth camp youth corps camp or job corps and that involve a knifing and there have be one or more death as a result of that be that the reason you visit the catoctin maryland camp last week to build the morale up in the camp and give they public confidence

 the president i visit the camp last week because i have agree to some time ago and have be force to cancel one plan visit i want to visit a good many of their camps

 we all deeply regret any accident or any violence or any injury that may occur at any time that be not the reason though or rather that be not the sole reason why i should be interested in what they be do i hope by my visit to well understand their work perhaps to stimulate some of they and maybe improve on what be be do

 reporter thank you mr. president

  i should like to ask you to stay here for another 10 or 15 minute we will say 15 minute for the attorney general to give you a very brief briefing on the high point of this message and if you will do that for 15 minute he will be here long and mr. moyers will but at the conclusion of 15 minute i hope that mr. reedy will tell you and any of you that need to rush away to meet your deadline can do so

 i should like to observe that the 15 minute be about up but at 9 o'clock in mr. reedy 's office on monday morning we plan and hope and pray that we will have the message ready for you if you will be ready for it there will be a briefing there

 over the past few week i have determine that we would have a voting right law this year on about november 15th and so inform certain member of the congress and certain governor of the states since that time i have talk to the majority and minority leader the chairman of various committee the speaker of the house and have review with they the highlight of my viewpoint and have ask the attorney general to go into some detail in connection with the principle that we would have in this bill

 we be very anxious to have democratic and republican support as you know president kennedy in the kennedy johnson administration in 1963 in the civil right measure that i counsel on and work on and approve submit to the congress a voting right section that provide however for vote only in federal election that section be delete in the legislation that finally come to i and as a result of that deletion i have feel that we should again approach that subject but to extend it from federal election to both state and local election

 i have talk to the leader of the negro organization in this country and ask for their suggestion and ask for their counsel i have talk to various southern senators and southern leader include governor and generally review with they what i hope to have encompass in this legislation of course there will be amendment and change and extension and deletion but i think that our message will go to the congress monday perhaps the bill will accompany it if not it will go there very shortly

 we will not only expect the congress to give fair and just consideration to the administration bill which they have be ask for for several day now but to give consideration to any one suggestion as they always do

 so if you will be back at 9 o'clock monday we will have a briefing on the detail of the message

 we thank you for endure we this afternoon

 thank you mr. president





mr. speaker mr. president members of the congress

 i speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy

 i urge every member of both party americans of all religion and of all color from every section of this country to join i in that cause

 at time history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in man 's unende search for freedom so it be at lexington and concord so it be a century ago at appomattox so it be last week in selma alabama

 there long suffer man and woman peacefully protest the denial of their right as americans many be brutally assault one good man a man of god be kill

 there be no cause for pride in what have happen in selma there be no cause for self satisfaction in the long denial of equal right of million of americans but there be cause for hope and for faith in our democracy in what be happen here tonight

 for the cry of pain and the hymn and protest of oppress people have summon into convocation all the majesty of this great government the government of the great nation on earth

 our mission be at once the old and the most basic of this country to right wrong to do justice to serve man

 in our time we have come to live with moment of great crisis our life have be mark with debate about great issue issue of war and peace issue of prosperity and depression but rarely in any time do an issue lie bare the secret heart of america itself rarely be we meet with a challenge not to our growth or abundance our welfare or our security but rather to the value and the purpose and the meaning of our beloved nation

 the issue of equal right for american negroes be such an issue and should we defeat every enemy should we double our wealth and conquer the star and still be unequal to this issue then we will have fail as a people and as a nation

 for with a country as with a person what be a man profit if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul

 there be no negro problem there be no southern problem there be no northern problem there be only an american problem and we be meet here tonight as americans not as democrats or republicans we be meet here as americans to solve that problem

 this be the first nation in the history of the world to be found with a purpose the great phrase of that purpose still sound in every american heart north and south all man be create equal"—"government by consent of the governed"—"give me liberty or give i death well those be not just clever word or those be not just empty theory in their name americans have fight and die for two century and tonight around the world they stand there as guardian of our liberty risk their life

 those word be a promise to every citizen that he shall share in the dignity of man this dignity can not be find in a man 's possession it can not be find in his power or in his position it really rest on his right to be treat as a man equal in opportunity to all other it say that he shall share in freedom he shall choose his leader educate his child and provide for his family accord to his ability and his merit as a human being

 to apply any other test to deny a man his hope because of his color or race his religion or the place of his birth be not only to do injustice it be to deny america and to dishonor the dead who give their life for american freedom

 our father believe that if this noble view of the right of man be to flourish it must be root in democracy the most basic right of all be the right to choose your own leader the history of this country in large measure be the history of the expansion of that right to all of our people

 many of the issue of civil right be very complex and most difficult but about this there can and should be no argument every american citizen must have an equal right to vote there be no reason which can excuse the denial of that right there be no duty which weigh more heavily on we than the duty we have to ensure that right

 yet the harsh fact be that in many place in this country man and woman be keep from vote simply because they be negro

 every device of which human ingenuity be capable have be use to deny this right the negro citizen may go to register only to be tell that the day be wrong or the hour be late or the official in charge be absent and if he persist and if he manage to present himself to the registrar he may be disqualify because he do not spell out his middle name or because he abbreviate a word on the application

 and if he manage to fill out an application he be give a test the registrar be the sole judge of whether he pass this test he may be ask to recite the entire constitution or explain the most complex provision of state law and even a college degree can not be use to prove that he can read and write

 for the fact be that the only way to pass these barrier be to show a white skin

 experience have clearly show that the exist process of law can not overcome systematic and ingenious discrimination no law that we now have on the book and i have help to put three of they there can ensure the right to vote when local official be determined to deny it

 in such a case our duty must be clear to all of we the constitution say that no person shall be keep from voting because of his race or his color we have all swear an oath before god to support and to defend that constitution we must now act in obedience to that oath

 wednesday i will send to congress a law design to eliminate illegal barrier to the right to vote

 the broad principle of that bill will be in the hand of the democratic and republican leader tomorrow after they have review it it will come here formally as a bill i be grateful for this opportunity to come here tonight at the invitation of the leadership to reason with my friend to give they my view and to visit with my former colleague

 i have have prepare a more comprehensive analysis of the legislation which i have intend to transmit to the clerk tomorrow but which i will submit to the clerk tonight but i want to really discuss with you now briefly the main proposal of this legislation

 this bill will strike down restriction to vote in all election federal state and local which have be use to deny negroes the right to vote

 this bill will establish a simple uniform standard which can not be use however ingenious the effort to flout our constitution

 it will provide for citizen to be register by official of the united states government if the state official refuse to register they

 it will eliminate tedious unnecessary lawsuit which delay the right to vote

 finally this legislation will ensure that properly register individual be not prohibit from vote

 i will welcome the suggestion from all of the members of congress i have no doubt that i will get some on way and mean to strengthen this law and to make it effective but experience have plainly show that this be the only path to carry out the command of the constitution

 to those who seek to avoid action by their national government in their own community who want to and who seek to maintain purely local control over election the answer be simple

 open your polling place to all your people

 allow man and woman to register and vote whatever the color of their skin

 extend the right of citizenship to every citizen of this land

 there be no constitutional issue here the command of the constitution be plain

 there be no moral issue it be wrong deadly wrong to deny any of your fellow americans the right to vote in this country

 there be no issue of states right or national right there be only the struggle for human right

 i have not the slight doubt what will be your answer

 the last time a president send a civil right bill to the congress it contain a provision to protect voting right in federal election that civil right bill be pass after eight long month of debate and when that bill come to my desk from the congress for my signature the heart of the voting provision have be eliminate

 this time on this issue there must be no delay no hesitation and no compromise with our purpose

 we can not we must not refuse to protect the right of every american to vote in every election that he may desire to participate in and we ought not and we can not and we must not wait another 8 month before we get a bill we have already wait a hundred year and more and the time for wait be go

 so i ask you to join i in work long hour night and weekend if necessary to pass this bill and i do not make that request lightly for from the window where i sit with the problem of our country i recognize that outside this chamber be the outraged conscience of a nation the grave concern of many nation and the harsh judgment of history on our act

 but even if we pass this bill the battle will not be over what happen in selma be part of a far large movement which reach into every section and state of america it be the effort of american negroes to secure for themselves the full blessing of american life

 their cause must be our cause too because it be not just negro but really it be all of we who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice and we shall overcome

 as a man whose root go deeply into southern soil i know how agonizing racial feeling be i know how difficult it be to reshape the attitude and the structure of our society

 but a century have pass more than a hundred year since the negro be free and he be not fully free tonight

 it be more than a hundred year ago that abraham lincoln a great president of another party sign the emancipation proclamation but emancipation be a proclamation and not a fact

 a century have pass more than a hundred year since equality be promise and yet the negro be not equal

 a century have pass since the day of promise and the promise be unkept

 the time of justice have now come i tell you that i believe sincerely that no force can hold it back it be right in the eye of man and god that it should come and when it do i think that day will brighten the life of every american

 for negroes be not the only victim how many white child have go uneducated how many white family have live in stark poverty how many white life have be scar by fear because we have waste our energy and our substance to maintain the barrier of hatred and terror

 so i say to all of you here and to all in the nation tonight that those who appeal to you to hold on to the past do so at the cost of deny you your future

 this great rich restless country can offer opportunity and education and hope to all black and white north and south sharecropper and city dweller these be the enemy poverty ignorance disease they be the enemy and not our fellow man not our neighbor and these enemy too poverty disease and ignorance we shall overcome

 now let none of we in any section look with prideful righteousness on the trouble in another section or on the problem of our neighbor there be really no part of america where the promise of equality have be fully keep in buffalo as well as in birmingham in philadelphia as well as in selma americans be struggle for the fruit of freedom

 this be one nation what happen in selma or in cincinnati be a matter of legitimate concern to every american but let each of we look within our own heart and our own community and let each of we put our shoulder to the wheel to root out injustice wherever it exist

 as we meet here in this peaceful historic chamber tonight man from the south some of whom be at iwo jima man from the north who have carry old glory to far corner of the world and bring it back without a stain on it man from the east and from the west be all fight together without regard to religion or color or region in viet nam man from every region fight for we across the world 20 year ago

 and in these common danger and these common sacrifice the south make its contribution of honor and gallantry no less than any other region of the great republic and in some instance a great many of they more

 and i have not the slight doubt that good man from everywhere in this country from the great lakes to the gulf of mexico from the golden gate to the harbor along the atlantic will rally together now in this cause to vindicate the freedom of all americans for all of we owe this duty and i believe that all of we will respond to it

 your president make that request of every american

 the real hero of this struggle be the american negro his action and protest his courage to risk safety and even to risk his life have awaken the conscience of this nation his demonstration have be design to call attention to injustice design to provoke change design to stir reform

 he have call upon we to make good the promise of america and who among we can say that we would have make the same progress be it not for his persistent bravery and his faith in american democracy

 for at the real heart of battle for equality be a deep seat belief in the democratic process equality depend not on the force of arm or tear gas but upon the force of moral right not on recourse to violence but on respect for law and order

 there have be many pressure upon your president and there will be other as the day come and go but i pledge you tonight that we intend to fight this battle where it should be fight in the court and in the congress and in the heart of man

 we must preserve the right of free speech and the right of free assembly but the right of free speech do not carry with it as have be say the right to holler fire in a crowded theater we must preserve the right to free assembly but free assembly do not carry with it the right to block public thoroughfare to traffic

 we do have a right to protest and a right to march under condition that do not infringe the constitutional right of our neighbor and i intend to protect all those right as long as i be permit to serve in this office

 we will guard against violence know it strike from our hand the very weapon which we seek progress obedience to law and belief in american value

 in selma as elsewhere we seek and pray for peace we seek order we seek unity but we will not accept the peace of stifle right or the order impose by fear or the unity that stifle protest for peace can not be purchase at the cost of liberty

 in selma tonight as in every and we have a good day there as in every city we be work for just and peaceful settlement we must all remember that after this speech i be make tonight after the police and the fbi and the marshals have all go and after you have promptly pass this bill the people of selma and the other city of the nation must still live and work together and when the attention of the nation have go elsewhere they must try to heal the wound and to build a new community

 this can not be easily do on a battleground of violence as the history of the south itself show it be in recognition of this that man of both race have show such an outstandingly impressive responsibility in recent day last tuesday again today

 the bill that i be present to you will be know as a civil right bill but in a large sense most of the program i be recommend be a civil right program its object be to open the city of hope to all people of all race

 because all americans just must have the right to vote and we be go to give they that right

 all americans must have the privilege of citizenship regardless of race and they be go to have those privilege of citizenship regardless of race

 but i would like to caution you and remind you that to exercise these privilege take much more than just legal right it require a train mind and a healthy body it require a decent home and the chance to find a job and the opportunity to escape from the clutch of poverty

 of course people can not contribute to the nation if they be never teach to read or write if their body be stunt from hunger if their sickness go untended if their life be spend in hopeless poverty just draw a welfare check

 so we want to open the gate to opportunity but we be also go to give all our people black and white the help that they need to walk through those gate

 my first job after college be as a teacher in cotulla texas in a small mexican american school few of they could speak english and i could not speak much spanish my student be poor and they often come to class without breakfast hungry they know even in their youth the pain of prejudice they never seem to know why people dislike they but they know it be so because i see it in their eye i often walk home late in the afternoon after the class be finish wish there be more that i could do but all i know be to teach they the little that i know hope that it might help they against the hardship that lie ahead

 somehow you never forget what poverty and hatred can do when you see its scar on the hopeful face of a young child

 i never think then in 1928 that i would be stand here in 1965 it never even occur to i in my fond dream that i might have the chance to help the son and daughter of those student and to help people like they all over this country

 but now i do have that chance and i will let you in on a secret i mean to use it and i hope that you will use it with i

 this be the rich and most powerful country which ever occupy the globe the might of past empire be little compare to ours but i do not want to be the president who build empire or seek grandeur or extend dominion

 i want to be the president who educate young child to the wonder of their world i want to be the president who help to feed the hungry and to prepare they to be taxpayer instead of tax eater

 i want to be the president who help the poor to find their own way and who protect the right of every citizen to vote in every election

 i want to be the president who help to end hatred among his fellow man and who promote love among the people of all race and all region and all party

 i want to be the president who help to end war among the brother of this earth

 and so at the request of your beloved speaker and the senator from montana the majority leader the senator from illinois the minority leader mr. mcculloch and other member of both party i come here tonight not as president roosevelt come down one time in person to veto a bonus bill not as president truman come down one time to urge the passage of a railroad bill but i come down here to ask you to share this task with i and to share it with the people that we both work for i want this to be the congress republicans and democrats alike which do all these thing for all these people

 beyond this great chamber out yonder in 50 states be the people that we serve who can tell what deep and unspoken hope be in their heart tonight as they sit there and listen we all can guess from our own life how difficult they often find their own pursuit of happiness how many problem each little family have they look most of all to themselves for their future but i think that they also look to each of we

 above the pyramid on the great seal of the united states it say in latin—"god have favor our undertaking

 god will not favor everything that we do it be rather our duty to divine his will but i can not help believe that he truly understand and that he really favor the undertaking that we begin here tonight

the president lady and gentleman welcome to the lbj ranch i hope you enjoy your stay and can bring the temperature up a little while you be here

 i have today send the follow telegram to the honorable george wallace governor of alabama montgomery alabama

 responsibility for maintain law and order in our federal system properly rest with the state and local government on the basis of your public statement and your discussion with i i think that you feel strongly about this and have indicate that you would take all the necessary action in this regard i be surprised therefore when in your telegram of thursday you request federal assistance in the performance of such fundamental state duty

 even more surprising be your telegram of yesterday state that both you and the alabama legislature because of monetary consideration believe that the state be unable to protect american citizen and to maintain peace and order in a responsible manner without federal force because the court order must be obey and the right of all american citizen must be protect i intend to meet your request by provide federal assistance to perform normal police function i be call into federal service select unit of the alabama national guard and also will have available police unit from the regular army to help you meet your state responsibility these force should be adequate to assure the right of american citizen pursuant to a federal court order to walk peaceably and safely without injury or loss of life from selma to montgomery ala.

 lyndon b. johnson

 it be not a welcome duty for the federal government to ever assume a state government 's own responsibility for assure the protection of citizen in the exercise of their constitutional right it have be rare in our history for the governor and the legislature of a sovereign state to decline to exercise their responsibility and to request that duty be assume by the federal government

 governor wallace and the legislature of the state of alabama have now do this i have respond both to their request and to what i believe be the sure and the certain duty of the federal government in the protection of constitutional right of all american citizen

 i have call select element of the alabama national guard into federal service additionally i have military police put in position at both selma and montgomery alabama in addition we have federal marshal fbi agent on duty in that area at this time

 last evening i dispatch deputy attorney general ramsey clark to the scene to coordinate all the national government 's activity he be assist by the very able burke marshall and john doar and some other dozen able lawyer from the department of justice

 over the next several day the eye of the nation will be upon alabama and the eye of the world will be upon america it be my prayer a prayer in which i hope all americans will join i earnestly today that the march in alabama may proceed in a manner honor our heritage and honor all for which america stand

 may this the conduct of all americans demonstrate beyond dispute that the true strength of america lie not in arm and not in force and not in the might of the military or in the police nor in the multitude of marshal and state trooper but in respect and obedience to law itself

 in other time a great president president abraham lincoln say that he be confident that we would be touch by the well angel of our nature that be my hope for you and my expectation of all of you and my prayer to all of you today

 a nation be mold by the test that its people meet and master i believe that from the test of these day we shall emerge as a strong nation as a more united people and a more just and decent society

 i will now pass to another subject to viet nam i want to announce this morning that ambassador maxwell taylor will shortly resume his periodic visit to washington for consultation on the viet nam situation he will return to washington on march 28 and will remain approximately a week there be no immediate issue which make the meeting urgent it be a regular repeat regular periodic visit part of our continuous consultation to make sure that our effort in viet nam be as effective and as efficient as possible

 let i say this additionally on viet nam one year ago on march 17 1964 i make this statement and i quote for 10 year under three president this nation have be determine to help a brave people to resist aggression and terror it be and it will remain the policy of the united states to furnish assistance to support south viet nam for as long as be require to bring communist aggression and terrorism under control

 under this policy change in the situation may require from time to time change in tactic in strategy in equipment in personnel as i say last month the continue action we take will be those that be justify and make necessary by the continue aggression of other these aggressor serve no peaceful interest not even their own no one threaten their regime there be no intent or desire to conquer they or to occupy their land what be want be simply that they carry out their agreement that they end their aggression against their neighbor

 the real goal of all of we in southeast asia must be the peaceful progress of the people of that area they have the right to live side by side in peace and independence and if this little country do not have that fight then the question be what will happen to the other hundred little country who want to preserve that right they have a right to build a new sense of community among themselves they have a right to join with help from other in the full development of their own resource for their own benefit they have a right to live together without fear or oppression or domination from any quarter of this entire globe

 so this morning the score card be 3 republicans 3 democrat and 1 independent

 finally because of the very considerable interest and discussion concern the president 's press policy i want to give you some idea of what you may plan and what you may expect in the day to come

 first of all i regard my own responsibility in this field as make available to all of you all of the information that i can consistent with the national interest on as fair and as equitable basis as possible how and where i do that be a decision that i reserve for myself and i shall continue to reserve for myself

 second i consider it the responsibility of the press to report those fact to the american public as fully as possible and in the good perspective possible the press of course also have the right and have the duty to comment on the fact in any way it see fit but that be a right and not a responsibility

 therefore i plan to see the press at many different time in many different way if you be willing i will however try to follow the stand practice of hold at least one press conference a month of the nature which you describe as ample advance notice coverage by all medium full dress even white tie if you choose

 i do not intend to restrict myself to this as the sole form of see the press but i will try to state it as a very minimum

 today mark the 39th on the record press conference that i have hold 18 off the record or a total of 57 i have have 18 press conference with adequate advance notice 16 cover by radio and television eight of these be live television in addition to 3 live television joint session in the little over a year that i have be president

 there have be other occasion upon which i have see the white house press corp on an informal basis in order to give they some insight into my thinking in addition to these 56 formal meeting i have have 9 informal lengthy walk with the white house press corps some of you who use to enjoy those walk when they be schedule a little early with president truman and from time to time those of you who enjoy they will be invite back again

 on various occasion i have have conference with pool represent the white house press we have have 173 airplane flight with pool where they visit two pool visit while i be in the hospital with a bad cold and one pool visit in my bedroom in the executive mansion when i think i be recuperate from it

 i have have additional visit from 374 accredited press representative at their request in addition 64 who request meeting with bureau chief plus 200 telephone discussion that i have respond to

 there have be 9 other occasion where i have meet with the press range from a barbecue at the ranch to address make to the american society of newspaper editor the associated press luncheon and of course last year each one of the social affair white house press conference and gridiron etc i believe number 8

 i have have 9 special appearance range from a television interview with all 3 network to special statement concern viet nam and the railroad strike

 a considerable amount of my time have be spend with the press in this effort to discharge what i consider to be the president 's responsibility to this country i think that it be necessary to do this because the press be the medium through which the american people be inform and as i say i intend to continue to bring they all the information that be possible and to see that every cabinet officer and every head of an independent agency do the same thing

 insofar as the president be concern i will continue see the press at different time different place and different way at my own choosing

 i be ready for any question

 q. mr. president your proclamation of this morning refer specifically to the 5 day period that the federal court approve for the alabama march be that the sum total of time to be cover by your action with respect to call up the guard and authorize the use of troop or will it go beyond that

 the president we anticipate the march will have be conclude by that period and we can not tell at this time any reason why it should go beyond that if it be necessary we will take appropriate action at an appropriate time

 q. mr. president can you tell we how many national guardsmen you be call to duty and how many military police you have available in alabama

 the president well for the moment we have call up 1,863 national guardsmen in addition we have approximately 100 fbi man we have approximately 75 to 100 marshal that be present other will join they later in the day in addition we have 500 man in place from ft bragg that be now at maxwell field montgomery in addition to that we have 509 man at the moment in place at craig field selma

 on alert we have a reinforce battalion at ft benning that can be there on short notice of an additional thousand man one company can be ready to move and be there in a very few hour the other be alert

 these military force be be place under the command of brig gen. henry graham who some of you will remember be the assistant division commander of the 31st infantry division he be the guardsman commander of the force that be federalize at tuscaloosa he be assist by a regular army man brig gen. james m. wright

 q. mr. president i get the impression that you do not quite believe that governor wallace maneuver you into this position only for monetary consideration i wonder if you could tell we why you think the governor have do what he have do

 the president i do not want to leave such an impression i want to correct it if i have leave the wrong impression what motivate governor wallace be a matter that he can discuss with you well than i can he have his responsibility and he be go to exercise they accord to his judgment and his view and i plan to do the same thing i just repeat the statement he make in his wire

 q. mr. president do you have any idea of the number of people who will take part in the march and be there any federal service available to they for medical care or that sort of thing

 the president we be keep in very close touch with the leader of the march we have reasonably accurate estimate of how many we think will be include we have medical force in the general area they have be alert to take care of any need that may arise and we hope and pray that there will be none

 we have a 75 bed hospital with 5 doctor and 5 ambulance 43 aircraft helicopter 5 ambulatory patient 2 litter with corpsmen this be locate at craig in selma at maxwell field we have a 250 bed hospital 50 doctor 5 ambulance 4 h-43 aircraft we trust it will not be necessary to use any of these but we have take the precaution and there be hardly a day pass but what the president be ask to provide medical service to some citizen where it be not available from other source and we do that in all instance where it be justify

 q. mr. president in your telegram to governor wallace you have refer to his discussion with you have you have discussion with he since this crisis develop or do that refer to early talk

 the president we have be constantly in touch with he general katzenbach and other member of the executive branch in washington and here since i receive his wire the other evening i have not talk to he have not talk to any of his people but our people be talk to he with regularity and try to give such counsel and guidance as we think will be helpful

 q. mr. president sir west german arm supply to israel which be institute with u.s. support have be cut off in view of this would the united states be willing to supply arm to israel to maintain a balance of power in the near east

 the president we do not discuss iffy question like that we will give consideration to the problem and the need of the various nation and country and while we have they under consideration we will try to evaluate they and if a decision be reach in any area with any country why we will carry it out but we do not think that it be desirable to speculate or to engage in any prophecy that may or may not work out

 q. mr. president under the term of the voting rights act do the administration plan to lower the literacy requirement if federal examiner be use and possibly so far that illiterate could be register in the south

 the president the administration have make its proposal in the form of legislation pende before the house committee there will be a number of amendment add to that and a number of change and my own personal view be include in the recommendation in that bill which be available to you i should have like to have go far if i think i could have without a constitutional amendment if i could have do it by statute in other respect concern voting but the legal talent available do not think that we could make these addition the final judgment of just how far we do go in connection with literacy and qualification of the elector will be determine by the two judiciary committee make up of lawyer and the other members of the congress

 very frankly i would like to have include in the message a provision that would permit all people over 18 year of age to vote but the lawyer feel that would complicate the matter and that it should be approach otherwise

 but specifically answer your question what final action will be take in the bill that be send to i will be determine by what be go on now and i hope that they will work every morning and afternoon and night and that we can have legislation very shortly

 q. mr. president in the 6 week sir that we have be bomb north of the 17th parallel have there be any measurable change in the north vietnamese support of the viet cong guerrilla in south viet nam

 the president i would not want to tell you or they or the country any of our evaluation of military operation at this time we be be as effective and as efficient as we know how we have our policy of respond appropriately fittingly and measure

 we be do everything that we know to try to bring about freedom for south viet nam and peace in that area that be the policy that general eisenhower announce when he be president when we assume responsibility there that be the policy provide for in the seato treaty that pass the senate 82 to 1 which obligate we to the commitment we have make there that be the policy that be incorporate in the resolution pass august the 10th by the congress but to give a day to day evaluation of what effect this strike or that strike might have would not only contribute i think to confusion and perhaps might be inaccurate but would be ill advise i think

 q. mr. president where do our space program stand in relation to the soviets in the wake of their late feat

 the president well we send they a wire congratulate they and express our good wish for the successful outcome of one of their test administrator webb be here today he come in last night from new mexico where he have be on an official visit i ask he to be here this morning he and i have review the russian activity in space this week as well as our own plan activity next week

 the soviet accomplishment and our own schedule effort demonstrate i think dramatically and convincingly the important role that man himself will play in the exploration of the space frontier the continue effort of both our program and the russian program will steadily produce new capability and new space activity

 these capability in my judgment will help each nation achieve broad confidence to do what they consider they ought to do in space

 i have feel since the day when i introduce the space act and sit study sputnik i and sputnik ii that it be really a mistake to regard space exploration as a contest which can be tally on any box score judgment can be make only by consider all the objective of the two national program and they will vary and they will differ

 our own program be very broadly base we believe very confidently in the united states that we will produce contribution that we need at the time we need they for that reason i give mr. webb and his group every dollar in the budget this year that they ask for for a manned space flight

 now the progress of our program be very satisfactory to i in every respect we be committed to peaceful purpose for the benefit of all mankind we stress that in our hearing and our legislation when we pass the bill and while the soviet be ahead of we in some aspect of space u.s. leadership be clear and decisive and we be ahead of they in other realm on which we have particularly concentrate

 if it be not an imposition on you and if you care to i have not consult he but after the conference be over if you be not in too big a hurry to get back to the driskill mr. webb will be here and he will answer any question you may want to ask he

 q. mr. president to return to the alabama situation there have be an incursion of proponent of the civil right measure into the selma area it have also be report there have be opponent of the civil right group do you know anything about the number of say extremist oppose this and what you can do about it and how dangerous will this march be that begin tomorrow

 the president i think you have state the fact that be available to all of we the people on the ground be take judicious notice of the entire situation we hope that we have take the necessary precaution and we be adequately prepared to deal with whatever may develop

 but i think it would be a great mistake to predict disaster and i think that we have the people that have the training and that will carry out the normal police function and i hope we have the patriotism on every side of the question and on all viewpoint to obey law and order and to respond to my plea this morning that we conduct ourselves as law abide americans who want to unite our country instead of divide it

 q. mr. president do you feel that the debate in the congress concern viet nam and especially those who have be urge quick negotiation have weaken your position or this country 's position

 the president i think our position be all right at the present time i never know what any statement what effect it may have on some other person

 we have freedom of speech in this country and that be one of the thing that we be work toward in our call up the guard last night and we have freedom of assembly and i have observe no lack of it in congress in the time i have be there in 35 year i have see no restraint impose by anybody

 i have never discuss with a human be something he should say or should not say on viet nam i think debate be healthy it be good for we provide it be responsible and i think we have have debate

 i have meet with 520 i believe congressmen and senators for over 2 hour for over 11 night and each one of they could ask any question he want to the secretary of state give they a thorough briefing the secretary of defense the president and the vice president and as i state you have raise the question with i 47 time we have cover it very good so maybe the senators and congressmen have some speech leave in order to be even with we

 thank you mr. president





my fellow americans

 in this historic room where just a few minute ago we honor brave man and great american achievement we have come now to talk about a tragedy and a stain on our american society

 i be certain by now that all of you know of the horrible crime which be commit last night between selma and montgomery alabama i have be in constant touch with the attorney general and the director of the fbi mr. j. edgar hoover throughout the night on this matter

 due to the very fast and the always efficient work of the special agent of the fbi who work all night long start immediately after the tragic death of mrs. viola liuzzo on a lonely road between selma and montgomery alabama arrest be make a few minute ago of four ku klux klan member in birmingham alabama charge they with conspiracy to violate the civil right of the murder woman

 mr. j. edgar hoover our honored public servant who be stand here by i have advise that the identity of the man charge with this heinous crime be as follow eugene thomas age 43 of bessemer william orville eaton age 41 also of bessemer gary thomas rowe jr. age 31 of birmingham and collie leroy wilkins jr. age 21 of fairfield alabama

 i can not express myself too strongly in praise mr. hoover and the man of the fbi for their prompt and expeditious and very excellent performance in handle this investigation it be in keep with the dedicated approach that this organization have show throughout the turbulent era of civil right controversy this nation and its president be very grateful for the highly intelligent and tireless effort of the distinguished attorney general nicholas katzenbach and his many associate who have carry the government 's fight to insure the right of all citizen guarantee to they by the constitution

 the four member of the united klans of america inc. knights of the ku klux klan will of course be arraign immediately they will later stand trial

 mrs. liuzzo go to alabama to serve the struggle for justice she be murder by the enemy of justice who for decade have use the rope and the gun and the tar and the feather to terrorize their neighbor they strike by night as they generally do for their purpose can not stand the light of day

 my father fight they many long year ago in texas and i have fight they all my life because i believe they to threaten the peace of every community where they exist i shall continue to fight they because i know their loyalty be not to the united states of america but instead to a hooded society of bigot

 man and woman have stand against the klan at time and at place where to do so require a continuous act of courage so if klansmen hear my voice today let it be both an appeal and a warning to get out of the ku klux klan now and return to a decent society before it be too late

 i call on every law enforcement officer in america to insist on obedience to the law and to insist on respect for justice no nation can long endure either in history 's judgment or in its own national conscience if hoodlum or bigot can defy the law and can get away with it justice must be do in the large city as well as the small village on the dirt road or on the interstate highway we will not be intimidate by the terrorist of the ku klux klan any more than we will be intimidate by the terrorist in north viet nam we will reduce the sacrifice of those who suffer now in a society free of the klan and those who support its vicious work

 i be ask and direct attorney general katzenbach to proceed at the early possible date to develop legislation that will bring the activity of the klan under effective control of the law and i be hopeful that that legislation can be submit just as soon as we can get the present voter right legislation through the congress in connection with new legislation congressional committee may wish to investigate the activity of such organization and the part that they play in instigate violence and i hope that if the congressional committee do decide to proceed forthwith they can be assure of the cooperation of all patriotic americans and certainly we will make all the resource of the federal government the justice department and fbi available to they

mr. webb mr. vice president members of the senate and the house

 this be a very proud and a very happy occasion for all of we here and i think it be a proud and happy occasion for all americans everywhere

 we intend to conduct this ceremony this morning outside in the rose garden however major grissom and commander young find their landing in washington this morning only slightly less wet than their landing in the atlantic ocean on tuesday

 so we meet now in the famous east room of the white house i think it be fitting that we should assemble for this purpose in this historic and hallowed room for 165 year this room have witness great moment of our history and it have know great man of our past from john adams to john kennedy

 a sense of history be present strongly here today all of we be conscious that we have cross over the threshold of man 's first tentative and experimental venture in space the question of whether there would be a role for man himself in space be already firmly and finally answer and answer affirmatively man 's role in space will be great it will be vital and it will be useful

 equally important we can comprehend now well than we ever have be able to in the past that the role of space in the life of man on earth will also be great and vital and useful

 so in this springtime of 1965 it seem incredible that it be only four springtime ago when young americans include gus grissom first fly into space we have come very far in a very few short year yet the quicken pace of our advance will carry we far beyond this point of achievement even before one more year pass

 the program we pursue now be a planned and orderly program with but one purpose the purpose of explore space for the service of peace and the benefit of all mankind here on this earth we be not concerned with stunt and spectacular but we be concern with sure and with steady success

 since we give our program direction and purpose 7 year ago many such success have be achieve through the effort of a great american team which now number 400,000 man and woman in industry on campus and in government and this team be inspire and stimulate and lead by a former marine and a great public servant jim webb

 we have come here today to honor just 4 of these 400,000 man on his team we honor gus grissom the first man to make two flight into space and we honor both gus grissom and john young as command pilot and pilot of our first two man gemini spacecraft flight

 we honor the director of project ranger mr. bud schurmeier he have lead the team which produce for we and for all mankind the most dramatic advance in our knowledge of the moon

 we also honor one of this nation 's most dedicated and most valuable public servant the top career man of the national aeronautics and space administration dr. robert seamans as general manager of our civilian space effort dr. seamans have perform absolutely magnificently all americans and all free man be in his debt

 through these four we honor all who have and who be contribute to america 's effort to advance the horizon of human knowledge

 this be a happy day in our nation 's capital it be a proud day for americans everywhere and i know it must be especially proud for the parent and the wife and the family of these two brave patriotic gallant and exceptional young americans and it give i much pleasure to be able to have they here in this first house of the land

 and now i want to thank each of you for come here and participate with we i be go to ask administrator webb to read the citation for these outstanding pioneer of the new age of space

 mr. webb

 this be a great day for all america i just wish it be possible for the two great president who provide such outstanding leadership in this field president eisenhower and president kennedy to be here to share these pleasure and joy with we

 it be during president eisenhower 's administration that the space agency be bear and under his leadership that it grow and develop it be president kennedy 's vision that bring about some of the thing that we be here applaud today

 i see in this room now i guess we do not have room up here for everyone who have play a vital part but back when the space administration be create and from that time until this hour there have be complete bipartisanship and member of both party have provide leadership in unite behind the space administrator and these fine young man who bring we the accomplishment that we be applaud today

 so i would like to ask the member of the house and the senate and their leader and the chairman of their committee to stand now and let us give the congress a hand for the part that it have play in bring into effect what we be so proud of

 congressman george miller of california be chairman of the house space committee and senator anderson of new mexico be chairman of the senate space committee we thank all the members of congress of both party and we be delighted to have have you and we hope you enjoy the day

 viet nam be far away from this quiet campus we have no territory there nor do we seek any the war be dirty and brutal and difficult and some 400 young man bear into an america that be burst with opportunity and promise have end their life on viet nam 's steaming soil

 why must we take this painful road

 why must this nation hazard its ease and its interest and its power for the sake of a people so far away

 we fight because we must fight if we be to live in a world where every country can shape its own destiny and only in such a world will our own freedom be finally secure

 this kind of world will never be build by bomb or bullet yet the infirmity of man be such that force must often precede reason and the waste of war the work of peace

 we wish that this be not so but we must deal with the world as it be if it be ever to be as we wish

 the world as it be in asia be not a serene or peaceful place

 the first reality be that north viet nam have attack the independent nation of south viet nam its object be total conquest

 of course some of the people of south viet nam be participate in attack on their own government but train man and supply order and arm flow in a constant stream from north to south

 this support be the heartbeat of the war

 and it be a war of unparalleled brutality simple farmer be the target of assassination and kidnapping woman and child be strangle in the night because their man be loyal to their government and help less village be ravage by sneak attack large scale raid be conduct on town and terror strike in the heart of city

 the confused nature of this conflict can not mask the fact that it be the new face of an old enemy

 over this war and all asia be another reality the deepening shadow of communist china the ruler in hanoi be urge on by peking this be a regime which have destroy freedom in tibet which have attack india and have be condemn by the united nations for aggression in korea it be a nation which be help the force of violence in almost every continent the contest in viet nam be part of a wide pattern of aggressive purpose

 why be these reality our concern why be we in south viet nam

 we be there because we have a promise to keep since 1954 every american president have offer support to the people of south viet nam we have help to build and we have help to defend thus over many year we have make a national pledge to he!p south viet nam defend its independence

 and i intend to keep that promise

 to dishonor that pledge to abandon this small and brave nation to its enemy and to the terror that must follow would be an unforgivable wrong

 we be also there to strengthen world order around the globe from berlin to thailand be people whose well being rest in part on the belief that they can count on we if they be attack to leave viet nam to its fate would shake the confidence of all these people in the value of an american commitment and in the value of america 's word the result would be increase unrest and instability and even wide war

 we be also there because there be great stake in the balance let no one think for a moment that retreat from viet nam would bring an end to conflict the battle would be renew in one country and then another the central lesson of our time be that the appetite of aggression be never satisfied to withdraw from one battlefield mean only to prepare for the next we must say in southeast asia as we do in europe in the word of the bible hitherto shalt thou come but no far

 there be those who say that all our effort there will be futile that china 's power be such that it be bind to dominate all southeast asia but there be no end to that argument until all of the nation of asia be swallow up

 there be those who wonder why we have a responsibility there well we have it there for the same reason that we have a responsibility for the defense of europe world war ii be fight in both europe and asia and when it end we find ourselves with continue responsibility for the defense of freedom

 our objective be the independence of south viet nam and its freedom from attack we want nothing for ourselves only that the people of south viet nam be allow to guide their own country in their own way

 we will do everything necessary to reach that objective and we will do only what be absolutely necessary

 in recent month attack on south viet nam be step up thus it become necessary for we to increase our response and to make attack by air this be not a change of purpose it be a change in what we believe that purpose require

 we do this in order to slow down aggression

 we do this to increase the confidence of the brave people of south viet nam who have bravely bear this brutal battle for so many year with so many casualty

 and we do this to convince the leader of north viet nam and all who seek to share their conquest of a very simple fact we will not be defeat we will not grow tired

 we will not withdraw either openly or under the cloak of a meaningless agreement

 we know that air attack alone will not accomplish all of these purpose but it be our good and prayerful judgment that they be a necessary part of the sure road to peace

 we hope that peace will come swiftly but that be in the hand of other besides ourselves and we must be prepare for a long continued conflict it will require patience as well as bravery the will to endure as well as the will to resist

 i wish it be possible to convince other with word of what we now find it necessary to say with gun and plane armed hostility be futile our resource be equal to any challenge because we fight for value and we fight for principle rather than territory or colony our patience and our determination be unende

 once this be clear then it should also be clear that the only path for reasonable man be the path of peaceful settlement

 such peace demand an independent south viet nam securely guarantee and able to shape its own relationship to all other free from outside interference tie to no alliance a military base for no other country

 these be the essential of any final settlement

 we will never be second in the search for such a peaceful settlement in viet nam

 there may be many way to this kind of peace in discussion or negotiation with the government concern in large group or in small one in the reaffirmation of old agreement or their strengthening with new one

 we have state this position over and over again fifty time and more to friend and foe alike and we remain ready with this purpose for unconditional discussion

 and until that bright and necessary day of peace we will try to keep conflict from spread we have no desire to see thousand die in battle asians or americans we have no desire to devastate that which the people of north viet nam have build with toil and sacrifice we will use our power with restraint and with all the wisdom that we can command but we will use it

 this war like most war be fill with terrible irony for what do the people of north viet nam want they want what their neighbor also desire food for their hunger health for their body a chance to learn progress for their country and an end to the bondage of material misery and they would find all these thing far more readily in peaceful association with other than in the endless course of battle

 these country of southeast asia be home for million of impoverished people each day these people rise at dawn and struggle through until the night to wrestle existence from the soil they be often wrack by disease plague by hunger and death come at the early age of 40

 stability and peace do not come easily in such a land neither independence nor human dignity will ever be win though by arm alone it also require the work of peace the american people have help generously in time past in these work now there must be a much more massive effort to improve the life of man in that conflict tear corner of our world

 the first step be for the country of southeast asia to associate themselves in a greatly expand cooperative effort for development we would hope that north viet nam would take its place in the common effort just as soon as peaceful cooperation be possible

 the united nations be already actively engage in development in this area as far back as 1961 i confer with our authority in viet nam in connection with their work there and i would hope tonight that the secretary general of the united nations could use the prestige of his great office and his deep knowledge of asia to initiate as soon as possible with the country of that area a plan for cooperation in increase development

 for our part i will ask the congress to join in a billion dollar american investment in this effort as soon as it be underway

 and i would hope that all other industrialized country include the soviet union will join in this effort to replace despair with hope and terror with progress

 the task be nothing less than to enrich the hope and the existence of more than a hundred million people and there be much to be do

 the vast mekong river can provide food and water and power on a scale to dwarf even our own tva

 the wonder of modern medicine can be spread through village where thousand die every year from lack of care

 school can be establish to train people in the skill that be need to manage the process of development

 and these objective and more be within the reach of a cooperative and determined effort

 i also intend to expand and speed up a program to make available our farm surplus to assist in feeding and clothe the needy in asia we should not allow people to go hungry and wear rag while our own warehouse overflow with an abundance of wheat and corn rice and cotton

 so i will very shortly name a special team of outstanding patriotic distinguished americans to inaugurate our participation in these program this team will be head by mr. eugene black the very able former president of the world bank

 in area that be still rip by conflict of course development will not be easy peace will be necessary for final success but we can not and must not wait for peace to begin this job

 this will be a disorderly planet for a long time in asia as elsewhere the force of the modern world be shake old way and uproot ancient civilization there will be turbulence and struggle and even violence great social change as we see in our own country now do not always come without conflict

 we must also expect that nation will on occasion be in dispute with we it may be because we be rich or powerful or because we have make some mistake or because they honestly fear our intention however no nation need ever fear that we desire their land or to impose our will or to dictate their institution

 but we will always oppose the effort of one nation to conquer another nation

 we will do this because our own security be at stake

 but there be more to it than that for our generation have a dream it be a very old dream but we have the power and now we have the opportunity to make that dream come true

 for century nation have struggle among each other but we dream of a world where dispute be settle by law and reason and we will try to make it so

 for most of history man have hate and kill one another in battle but we dream of an end to war and we will try to make it so

 for all existence most man have live in poverty threaten by hunger but we dream of a world where all be feed and charge with hope and we will help to make it so

 the ordinary man and woman of north viet nam and south viet nam of china and india of russia and america be brave people they be fill with the same proportion of hate and fear of love and hope most of they want the same thing for themselves and their family most of they do not want their son to ever die in battle or to see their home or the home of other destroy

 well this can be their world yet man now have the knowledge always before deny to make this planet serve the real need of the people who live on it

 i know this will not be easy i know how difficult it be for reason to guide passion and love to master hate the complexity of this world do not bow easily to pure and consistent answer

 but the simple truth be there just the same we must all try to follow they as well we can

 we often say how impressive power be but i do not find it impressive at all the gun and the bomb the rocket and the warship be all symbol of human failure they be necessary symbol they protect what we cherish but they be witness to human folly

 a dam build across a great river be impressive

 in the countryside where i be bear and where i live i have see the night illuminate and the kitchen warm and the home heat where once the cheerless night and the ceaseless cold hold sway and all this happen because electricity come to our area along the hum wire of the rea electrification of the countryside yes that too be impressive

 a rich harvest in a hungry land be impressive

 the sight of healthy child in a classroom be impressive

 these not mighty arm be the achievement which the american nation believe to be impressive

 and if we be steadfast the time may come when all other nation will also find it so

 every night before i turn out the light to sleep i ask myself this question have i do everything that i can do to unite this country have i do everything i can to help unite the world to try to bring peace and hope to all the people of the world have i do enough

 ask yourselves that question in your home and in this hall tonight have we each of we all do all we could have we do enough

 we may well be live in the time foretell many year ago when it be say i call heaven and earth to record this day against you that i have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live

 this generation of the world must choose destroy or build kill or aid hate or understand

 we can do all these thing on a scale never dream of before

 well we will choose life in so do we will prevail over the enemy within man and over the natural enemy of all mankind

 to dr. eisenhower and mr. garland and this great institution johns hopkins i thank you for this opportunity to convey my thought to you and to the american people

 good night



 mr. garland senator brewster senator tydings member of the congressional delegation member of the faculty of johns hopkins student body my fellow americans

 last week 17 nation send their view to some two dozen country have an interest in southeast asia we be join those 17 country and state our american policy tonight which we believe will contribute toward peace in this area of the world

 i have come here to review once again with my own people the view of the american government

 tonight americans and asians be die for a world where each people may choose its own path to change

 this be the principle for which our ancestor fight in the valley of pennsylvania it be the principle for which our son fight tonight in the jungle of viet nam

 viet nam be far away from this quiet campus we have no territory there nor do we seek any the war be dirty and brutal and difficult and some 400 young man bear into an america that be burst with opportunity and promise have end their life on viet nam 's steaming soil

 to dr. eisenhower and mr. garland and this great institution johns hopkins i thank you for this opportunity to convey my thought to you and to the american people

 good night

the president good afternoon lady and gentleman i be glad to see that you be willing to trade your new comfort in the west lobby for these straight back chair in the east room

 today i have somewhat of a conflict of emotion i want to give you due and adequate 3 day notice of a press conference and at the same time i do not want to manage the news by hold up the announcement of some appointee i have here today so we have try to reconcile the two and a little later in the statement i want to present to you some man that over the weekend i select to occupy some important post in government

 we be engage in a crucial struggle in viet nam some may consider it a small war but to the man who give their life it be the last war and the stake be high independent south viet nam have be attack by north viet nam the object of that attack be total conquest defeat in south viet nam would deliver a friendly nation to terror and repression it would encourage and spur on those who seek to conquer all free nation that be within their reach

 our own welfare our own freedom would be in great danger this be the clear lesson of our time from munich until today we have learn that to yield to aggression bring only great threat and bring even more destructive war to stand firm be the only guarantee of a last peace at every step of the way we have use our great power with the utmost restraint we have make every effort possible to find a peaceful solution we have do this in the face of the most outrageous and brutal provocation against vietnamese and against americans alike

 through the first 7 month of 1964 both vietnamese and americans be the target of constant attack of terror bomb explode in helpless village in downtown movie theater even at the sport field where the child play soldier and civilian man and woman be murder and cripple yet we take no action against the source of this brutality north viet nam

 when our destroyer be attack in the gulf of tonkin as you will remember last summer we reply promptly with a single raid the punishment then be limit to the deed for the next 6 month we take no action against north viet nam we warn of danger we hope for caution in other

 their answer be attack and explosion and indiscriminate murder so it soon become clear that our restraint be view as weakness our desire to limit conflict be view as a prelude to our surrender

 we could no long stand by while attack mount and while the basis of the attacker be immune from reply therefore we begin to strike back but america have not change her essential position and that purpose be peaceful settlement that purpose be to resist aggression that purpose be to avoid a wide war

 i say again that i will talk to any government anywhere any time without any condition and if any doubt our sincerity let they test we each time we have meet with silence or slander or the sound of gun but just as we will not flag in battle we will not weary in the search for peace

 so i reaffirm my offer of unconditional discussion

 we will discuss any subject and any point of view with any government concern

 this offer may be reject as it have be in the past but it will remain open wait for the day when it become clear to all that armed attack will not yield domination over other

 and i will continue along the course that we have set firmness with moderation readiness for peace with refusal to retreat for this be the same battle which we fight for a generation wherever we have stand firm aggression have be halt peace have be restore and liberty have be maintain this be true under president truman under president eisenhower under president kennedy and it will be true again in southeast asia

 i want to go now to another subject i want to congratulate the negotiator for the steel company and the united steelworkers union on the statesmanlike agreement that they reach yesterday to extend their contract i hope and i expect that it will be approve by the union 's committee tomorrow while the settlement reach in steel be only an interim one i think we can be confident that the final settlement will be a responsible one which fully consider not only the interest of the immediate party but also the large public interest

 so far in 1965 our record of wage price stability remain intact a survey of the wage increase on more than 600 collective bargaining settle so far this year show that on the average the percentage increase be unchanged from the moderate increase agree on in the same period last year a number of important settlement be at approximately the level of our guidepost and this record of private action be most encouraging

 today i can report to you and to the nation that our expand economy will produce high federal revenue this year than we estimate to congress in january i can also report that our continue drive to hold down government spending will produce low expenditure this year than we estimate to congress in january as a result we expect the actual budget deficit for fiscal 1965 to be at least $ 1 billion below the $ 6,300 million estimate last january when we send our budget to congress

 our expenditure therefore will be decrease by approximately $ 500 million under our estimate and the revenue collect will be increase by approximately $ 500 million over our estimate

 i be pleased also to announce today that the war on poverty be set up 10 new job corps conservation camp in nine state they will bring to 87 the number of center that provide skill and education to our youngster who be out of school and out of work these new center will be locate in the states of arizona maine minnesota montana new mexico north dakota ohio utah and washington

 q. mr. president can you tell we your reaction or any information you have on the report of seemingly intensify fighting between the indians and the force of pakio start and could this possibly relate or have an effect on the fighting in viet nam

 the president we deplore fight wherever it take place we have be in dose touch with the situation there we be very hopeful that way and mean can be find to avoid conflict between these two friend of our country i talk to secretary rusk about it within the hour and we be anxious to do anything and everything that we can do to see that peace be restore in that area and conflict be end

 q. mr. president today the soviet union agree to a french proposal for a 5 power nuclear disarmament conference which would include communist china as a nuclear power what would be your attitude to this proposal sir

 the president i have not study the proposal and be not familiar with the fact that it have be make

 q. mr. president the only formal answer so far to your baltimore speech 2 be that by the north vietnamese prime minister pham van dong who offer a 4 point formula which he suggest be a possible basis for negotiation my question be do you regard the 4 point as so unacceptable as to be a complete rejection of your offer to begin discussion or be there portion of the 4 point which interest you and which you might be willing to discuss

 the president i think it be very evident from the baltimore speech that most of the non communist country in the world welcome the proposal in that speech and most of the communist country find objection with it i be very hopeful that some way and mean can be find to bring the party who be interested in southeast asia to a conference table just what those way and mean will be i do not know but every day we explore to the limit of our capacity every possible political and diplomatic move that would bring that about

 q. mr. president i wonder sir if you could evaluate for we the threat that have be pose by red china to send volunteer into viet nam if we escalate the war far

 the president we have read their statement from time to time and the statement of other power about what they propose 2 item 172 to do we be in close touch with the situation that be all i think i would like to say on that matter

 q. mr. president there have be some criticism at the local level in this country of your war on poverty and one of the chief complaint be that the local community action group do not represent the poor have you find any basis for this criticism and do you feel that criticism such as this could have a demoralizing effect on the overall program

 the president yes i think there have be unjust criticism and unfair criticism and uninformed criticism of the poverty program even before congress pass it some people oppose it every step of the way some people oppose it now

 i do not know of any national program in peacetime that have reach so many people so fast and so effectively over 16,000 americans have already volunteer to live and work with the peace corps domestically a quarter of a million young man have join the job corps every major city have develop poverty plan and make application for fund three hundred state city and county community action program have already receive their money forty five thousand student from needy family be already enrol in 800 college under the work program more than 125,000 adult be trainee in adult education on the work experience program

 we will have difficulty we will have politician attempt to get some job in the local level we will have these difference as we do in all of our program but i have great confidence in sargent shriver as an administrator and as a man and i have great confidence in the wisdom the congress display in pass the poverty program i think it will be one of the great monument to this administration

 q. mr. president be it true that the united states be lose rather than make friend around the world with its policy in viet nam sort of a fail domino theory in reverse

 the president i think that we have friend throughout the world i be not concerned with any friend that we have lose follow my baltimore speech i receive from our ally almost a universal approval our enemy would have you believe that we be follow policy that be ill advise but we be follow the same policy in asia that we follow in europe that we follow in turkey and greece and iran we be resist aggression and as long as the aggressor attack we will stay there and resist they whether we make friend or lose friend

 q. mr. president your voting right bill be move toward completion in the senate this week do you think that proposal the amendment to abolish the poll tax would make this unconstitutional do you think it would damage the passage of the bill in the house and what do you think about it generally

 the president i think that be be work out in the conference they be have today and they will have in the next few week i have always oppose the poll tax i be oppose to it now i have be advise by constitutional lawyer that we have a problem in repeal the poll tax by statute for that reason while a member of congress i initiate and support a constitutional amendment to repeal the poll tax in federal election

 i think the bill as now draw will not permit the poll tax to be use to discriminate against voter and i think the administration will have adequate authority to prevent its use for that purpose i have ask the attorney general however to meet with the various member of the house and senate who be interested in this phase of it and if possible take every step that he can within constitutional bound to see that the poll tax be not use as a discrimination against any voter anywhere

 q. mr. president a number of critic of your viet nam policy say they support our presence in south viet nam but do not support the bombing raid to the north i wonder if there be anything you can say to they and what you can say on any condition that might arise under which you feel the raid could be stop

 the president i say in my opening statement that we go for month without destroy a bridge or an ammunition depot or a radar station those military target have be the primary target that we have attack there be no blood in a bridge make of concrete and steel but we do try to take it out so that people can not furnish additional troop and additional equipment to kill the people of south viet nam and to kill our own soldier there be not many civilian involve in a radar station but we do try to make it ineffective so that they can not plot our plane and shoot our boy out of the sky

 there be not many individual involve in an ammunition dump but we have try to destroy that ammunition so that it would be explode in north viet nam and not in the body of the people of south viet nam or our american soldier

 we have say time and time again that we regret the necessity of do this but as long as aggression continue as long as they bomb in south viet nam as long as they bomb our sport arena and our theater and our embassy and kill our woman and our child and the vietnamese soldier several thousand of whom have be kill since the first of the year we think that we be justify in try to slow down that operation and make they realize that it be very costly and that their aggression should cease

 i do sometimes wonder how some people can be so concerned with our bombing a cold bridge of steel and concrete in north viet nam but never open their mouth about a bomb be place in our embassy in south viet nam the moment that this aggression cease the destruction of their bridge and their radar station and the ammunition that they use on our body will cease

 q. mr. president on your cancellation of the ayub and shastri visit some of your critic have say that the reason for your postponement be sound but the abruptness of it leave million of asians angry at this country be anything be do to correct that impression on their part

 the president first of all i would not assume many part of your statement

 first we do not cancel it so that be the first error that the critic have make we feel very friendly toward the people of india and the government of india toward the people of pakistan and the government of pakistan i have spend some time in both of those country i have have the leader of those country visit i in this country and visit in my home

 i have before the congress now recommendation concern the people of those country and how we can work together to try to achieve peace in the world

 i say through the appropriate channel to those government that i have have some eight or nine visitor already the first 90 day of this administration that the congress be hopeful that it would get out of here in early summer that we have approximately 75 top important measure that we be try to get consider and pass one of which vitally affect that part of the world and that i could be much more communicative and could respond much more to their suggestion and to their recommendation on the future of india and their 5 year plan and pakistan and their plan if our visit could follow the enactment of some of these bill instead of precede they because if it precede they i could not speak with authority i would not know what the congress would do

 we have spend in excess of $ 10 billion in that area and this year we will propose expenditure of more than $ 1 billion but if the congress say no to i and do not pass the foreign aid bill or materially reduce it i would have make a commitment that i could not support so i say if you would like to come now in the month of may or june during this period we can have a visit but we will not be able to be as responsive as i would like to be if you could come a little later in the year

 i have be host a few time in my life and when you put thing that way most people want to come at the time that would be most convenient to we to the host and would be most helpful to they we communicate that to the appropriate people and the answer come back that they would accept that decision

 i think it be a good decision in our interest and i think it be a good decision in their interest i be very sorry that our people have make a good deal of it but the provocation of the difference sometimes come about and i regret it so far as i know it be a good decision and a wise one and one that i would make again tomorrow

 q. mr. president in light of the news report that come over the weekend i wonder if you could clarify for we your position concern the possibility of the use of nuclear weapon in southeast asia

 the president well first of all i have the responsibility for decision on nuclear weapon that rest with the president it be the most serious responsibility that rest with he secretary mcnamara very carefully and very clearly in his television appearance yesterday cover that subject thoroughly and i think adequately there be not anything that i could really add to what he say

 i would observe this that i have be president for 17 month and i have sit many hour and week with the official of this government in try to plan for the protection and security of our people i have never have a suggestion from a single official of this government or employee of this government concern the use of such weapon in this area the only person that have ever mention it to i have be a newspaperman write a story and each time i tell they please get it out of your system please forget it there be just not anything to it no one have discuss it with we at all

 i think that when secretary mcnamara tell you of the requirement yesterday and that no useful purpose be serve by go into it far i think it have end there

 q. mr. president the north vietnamese today sir say that in a raid on sunday the united states and the south vietnamese use what they call toxic chemical could you tell we sir what they might be talk about

 the president i would not know i frequently see statement they make that we never hear of i do not know about the particular report that you mention

 q. mr. president could there come about as you now see the situation in viet nam could there be circumstance in which large number of american troop might be engage in the fighting of the war rather than in the advising and assistance to the south vietnamese

 the president our purpose in viet nam be as you well know to advise and to assist those people in resist aggression we be perform that duty there now i would not be able to anticipate or to speculate on the conduct of each individual in the day ahead i think that if the enemy there believe that we be there to stay that we be not go to tuck our tail and run home and abandon our friend i believe in due time peace can be observe in that area

 my objective be to contribute what we can to assist the people of south viet nam who have lose thousand of life defend their country and to provide the maximum amount of deterrent with the minimum cost they have lose thousand of people since february we have lose some 40 to 50 people of our own we could not anticipate in february whether we would lose 50 or whether we would lose 500 that depend on the fortune and the problem of conflict but i can assure you that we be be very careful that we be be very studious that we be be very deliberate that we be try to do everything we can within reason to convince these people that they should not attack that they should not be aggressor that they should not try to swallow up their neighbor and we be do it with the minimum amount of expenditure of life that we can spend

 q. mr. president labor and management in steel have differ version of what their increase in productivity be can you tell we what your adviser figure this be and whether you think a settlement in excess of the 2.7 percent of the interim agreement would be acceptable

 the president i do not want to pass on it we have lay down the guidepost they be well acquainted with they both management and employee they have have very responsible negotiation and we be very pleased with the outcome of those negotiation we anticipate that they will be confirm by both party very shortly and we believe between now and the september deadline that we will have an agreement i do not think that i have ever observe a period in the life of free enterprise in this country when american labor and american business have be more responsible and have be more anxious to work with their government in maintain full productivity and i expect that that will come about

 thank you mr. president





i have just conclude a meeting with the leader of the congress i report to they on the serious situation in the dominican republic i report the decision that this government consider necessary in this situation in order to protect american life
 the member of the leadership express their support of these decision the united states government have be inform by military authority in the dominican republic that american life be in danger these authority be no long able to guarantee their safety and they have report that the assistance of military personnel be now need for that purpose

 pursuant to my instruction 400 marines have already land general wheeler the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff have just report to i that there have be no incident
 we have appeal repeatedly in recent day for a cease fire between the contend force of the dominican republic in the interest of all dominicans and foreigner alike
 i repeat this urgent appeal again tonight the council of the oas have be advise of the situation by the dominican ambassador and the council will be keep fully inform

good evening lady and gentleman
 i have just come from a meeting with the leader of both party in the congress which be hold in the cabinet room in the white house i brief they on the fact of the situation in the dominican republic i want to make those same fact know to all the american people and to all the world
 there be time in the affair of nation when great principle be test in an ordeal of conflict and danger this be such a time for the american nation
 at stake be the life of thousand the liberty of a nation and the principle and the value of all the american republics that be why the hope and the concern of this entire hemisphere be on this sabbath sunday focus on the dominican republic
 in the dark mist of conflict and violence revolution and confusion it be not easy to find clear and unclouded truth
 but certain thing be clear and they require equally clear action to understand i think it be necessary to begin with the event of 8 or 9 day ago
 last week our observer warn of an approach political storm in the dominican republic i immediately ask our ambassador to return to washington at once so that we might discuss the situation and might plan a course of conduct but event soon outrun our hope for peace
 saturday april 24th—8 day ago while ambassador bennett be confer with the high official of your government revolution erupt in the dominican republic element of the military force of that country overthrow their government however the rebel themselves be divide some want to restore former president juan bosch other oppose his restoration president bosch elect after the fall of trujillo and his assassination have be drive from office by an early revolution in the dominican republic
 those who oppose mr. bosch 's return form a military committee in an effort to control that country the other take to the street and they begin to lead a revolt on behalf of president bosch control and effective government dissolve in conflict and confusion
 meanwhile the united states be make a constant effort to restore peace from saturday afternoon onward our embassy urge a cease fire and i and all the official of the american government work with every weapon at our command to achieve it
 on tuesday the situation of turmoil be present to the peace committee of the organization of american states
 on wednesday the entire council of the organization of american states receive a full report from the dominican ambassador
 meanwhile all this time from saturday to wednesday the danger be mount even though we be deeply sadden by bloodshed and violence in a close and friendly neighbor we have no desire to interfere in the affair of a sister republic
 on wednesday afternoon there be no long any choice for the man who be your president i be sit in my little office review the world situation with secretary rusk secretary mcnamara and mr. mcgeorge bundy shortly after 3 o'clock i receive a cable from our ambassador and he say that thing be in danger he have be inform that the chief of police and the governmental authority could no long protect we we immediately start the necessary conference call to be prepare
 at 5:14 almost 2 hour later we receive a cable that be label critic a word that be reserve for only the most urgent and immediate matter of national security
 the cable report that dominican law enforcement and military official have inform our embassy that the situation be completely out of control and that the police and the government could no long give any guarantee concern the safety of americans or of any foreign national
 ambassador bennett who be one of our most experienced foreign service officer go on in that cable to say that only an immediate landing of american force could safeguard and protect the life of thousand of americans and thousand of other citizen of some 30 other country ambassador bennett urge your president to order an immediate landing
 in this situation hesitation and vacillation could mean death for many of our people as well as many of the citizen of other land i think that we could not and we do not hesitate our force american force be order in immediately to protect american life they have do that they have attack no one and although some of our serviceman give their life not a single american civilian and the civilian of any other nation as a result of this protection lose their life
 there may be those in our own country who say that such action be good but we should have wait or we should have delay or we should have consult far or we should have call a meeting but from the very beginning the united states at my instruction have work for a cease fire begin the saturday the revolution take place the matter be before the oas peace committee on tuesday at our suggestion it be before the full council on wednesday and when i make my announcement to the american people that evening i announce then that i be notify the council
 when that cable arrive when our entire country team in the dominican republic make up of nine man one from the army navy and air force our ambassador our aid man and other say to your president unanimously mr. president if you do not send force immediately man and woman americans and those of other land will die in the streets"—well i know there be no time to talk to consult or to delay for in this situation delay itself would be decision the decision to risk and to lose the life of thousand of americans and thousand of innocent people from all land
 i want you to know that it be not a light or an easy matter to send our american boy to another country but i do not think that the american people expect their president to hesitate or to vacillate in the face of danger just because the decision be hard when life be in peril
 meanwhile the revolutionary movement take a tragic turn communist leader many of they train in cuba see a chance to increase disorder to gain a foothold join the revolution they take increase control and what begin as a popular democratic revolution commit to democracy and social justice very shortly move and be take over and really seize and place into the hand of a band of communist conspirator
 many of the original leader of the rebellion the follower of president bosch take refuge in foreign embassy because they have be supersede by other evil force and the secretary general of the rebel government martinez francisco appeal for a cease fire but he be ignore the revolution be now in other and dangerous hand
 when these new and ominous development emerge the oas meet again and it meet at the request of the united states i be glad to say that they respond wisely and decisively a five nation oas team be now in the dominican republic act to achieve a cease fire to ensure the safety of innocent people to restore normal condition and to open a path to democratic process
 that be the situation now
 i plead therefore with every person and every country in this hemisphere that would choose to do so to contact their ambassador and the dominican republic directly and to get firsthand evidence of the horror and the hardship the violence and the terror and the international conspiracy from which u.s. serviceman have rescue the people of more than 30 nation from that war tear island
 early today i order two additional battalions—2,000 extra man to proceed immediately to the dominican republic in the meeting that i just conclude with the congressional leader follow that meeting i direct the secretary of defense and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff to issue instruction to land an additional 4,500 man at the early possible moment the distribution of food to people who have not eat for day the need of medical supply and attention for the sick and wound the health requirement to avoid an epidemic because there be hundred that have be dead for day that be now in the street and that further protection of the security of each individual that be catch on that island require the attention of the additional force which i have order to proceed to the dominican republic
 in addition our serviceman have already since they land on wednesday night evacuate 3,000 person from 30 country in the world from this little island but more than 5,000 people 1,500 of whom be americans the other be foreign national be tonight await evacuation as i speak we just must get on with that job immediately
 the american nation can not must not and will not permit the establishment of another communist government in the western hemisphere this be the unanimous view of all the american nation when in january 1962 they declare and i quote the principle of communism be incompatible with the principle of the inter american system
 this be what our beloved president john f. kennedy mean when less than a week before his death he tell we we in this hemisphere must also use every resource at our command to prevent the establishment of another cuba in this hemisphere
 this be and this will be the common action and the common purpose of the democratic force of the hemisphere for the danger be also a common danger and the principle be common principle
 so we have act to summon the resource of this entire hemisphere to this task we have send on my instruction night before last special emissary such as ambassador moscoso of puerto rico our very able ambassador averell harriman and other to latin america to explain the situation to tell they the truth and to warn they that joint action be necessary we be in contact with such distinguished latin american statesman as romulo betancourt and jose figueres we be seek their wisdom and their counsel and their advice we have also maintain communication with president bosch who have choose to remain in puerto rico
 we have be consult with the organization of american states and our distinguished ambassador than whom there be no well ambassador bunker have be report to they at great length all the action of this government and we have be act in conformity with their decision
 we know that many who be now in revolt do not seek a communist tyranny we think it be tragic indeed that their high motive have be misuse by a small band of conspirator who receive their direction from abroad
 to those who fight only for liberty and justice and progress i want to join with the organization of american states in say in appeal to you tonight to lay down your arm and to assure you there be nothing to fear the road be open for you to share in build a dominican democracy and we in america be ready and anxious and willing to help you your courage and your dedication be quality which your country and all the hemisphere need for the future you be need to help shape that future and neither we nor any other nation in this hemisphere can or should take it upon itself to ever interfere with the affair of your country or any other country
 we believe that change come and we be glad it do and it should come through peaceful process but revolution in any country be a matter for that country to deal with it become a matter call for hemispheric action only repeat only when the object be the establishment of a communistic dictatorship
 let i also make clear tonight that we support no single man or any single group of man in the dominican republic our goal be a simple one we be there to save the life of our citizen and to save the life of all people our goal in keep with the great principle of the inter american system be to help prevent another communist state in this hemisphere and we would like to do this without bloodshed or without large scale fighting
 the form and the nature of a free dominican government i assure you be solely a matter for the dominican people but we do know what kind of government we hope to see in the dominican republic for that be carefully spell out in the treaty and the agreement which make up the fabric of the entire inter american system it be express time and time again in the word of our statesman and in the value and hope which bind we all together
 we hope to see a government freely choose by the will of all the people
 we hope to see a government dedicate to social justice for every single citizen
 we hope to see a government work every hour of every day to feed the hungry to educate the ignorant to heal the sick a government whose only concern be the progress and the elevation and the welfare of all the people
 for more than 3 decade the people of that tragic little island suffer under the weight of one of the most brutal and despotic dictatorship in the history of the americas we enthusiastically support condemnation of that government by the organization of american states we join in apply sanction and when trujillo be assassinate by his fellow citizen we immediately act to protect freedom and to prevent a new tyranny and since that time we have take the resource from all of our people at some sacrifice to many and we have help they with food and with other resource with the peace corps volunteer with the aid technician we have help they in the effort to build a new order of progress
 how sad it be tonight that a people so long oppress should once again be the target of the force of tyranny their long misery must weigh heavily on the heart of every citizen of this hemisphere so i think it be our mutual responsibility to help the people of the dominican republic toward the day when they can freely choose the path of liberty and justice and progress this be require of we by the agreement that we be party to and that we have sign this be require of we by the value which bind we together
 simon bolivar once write from exile the veil have be tear asunder we have already see the light and it be not our desire to be thrust back into the darkness
 well after decade of night the dominican people have see a more hopeful light and i know that the nation of this hemisphere will not let they be thrust back into the darkness
 and before i leave you my fellow americans i want to say this personal word i know that no american serviceman want to kill anyone i know that no american president want to give an order which bring shooting and casualty and death i want you to know and i want the world to know that as long as i be president of this country we be go to defend ourselves we will defend our soldier against attacker we will honor our treaty we will keep our commitment we will defend our nation against all those who seek to destroy not only the united states but every free country of this hemisphere we do not want to bury anyone as i have say so many time before but we do not intend to be bury
 thank you god bless you good night

good morning lady and gentleman and my friend of the association of american editorial cartoonists

 i be very happy that you request through the press office this opportunity for we to meet together because after look at some of the cartoon you have draw i think i would invite you over to see i in person after all i have nothing to lose

 i know that i be talk to the most influential journalist in america reporter may write and politician may talk but what you draw remain in the public memory long after these other word be forget that be why after i learn that you would be here and we would meet together i put together some note to discuss with you while you be in washington a very little know side of our activity in one of the most vital place in the world south viet nam

 the war in viet nam have many face there be the face of armed conflict of terror and gunfire of bomb heavy plane and campaign weary soldier in this conflict our only object be to prove that force will meet force   that armed conquest be futile and that aggression be not only wrong but it just will not work

 and the communists in viet nam be slowly begin to realize what they once scorn to believe that we combine unlimited patience with unlimited resource in pursuit of an unwavering purpose

 we will not abandon our commitment to south viet nam

 the second face of war in viet nam be the quest for a political solution the face of diplomacy and politic of the ambition and the interest of other nation we know as our adversary should also know that there be no purely military solution in sight for either side

 we be ready for unconditional discussion most of the non communist nation of the world favor such unconditional discussion and it would dearly be in the interest of north viet nam to now come to the conference table for they the continuation of war without talk mean only damage without conquest

 communist china apparently desire the war to continue whatever the cost to their ally their target be not merely south viet nam it be asia their objective be not the fulfillment of vietnamese nationalism it be to erode and to discredit america 's ability to help prevent chinese domination over all of asia

 in this domination they shall never succeed

 and i be continue and i be increase the search for every possible path to peace

 the third face of war in viet nam be at once the most tragic and most hopeful it be the face of human need it be the untended sick the hungry family and the illiterate child it be man and woman many without shelter with rag for clothing struggle for survival in a very rich and a very fertile land

 it be the most important battle of all in which we be engaged

 for a nation can not be build by armed power or by political agreement it will rest on the expectation by individual man and woman that their future will be well than their past

 it be not enough to just fight against something people must fight for something and the people of south viet nam must know that after the long brutal journey through the dark tunnel of conflict there break the light of a happy day and only if this be so can they be expect to sustain the endure will for continued strife only in this way can long run stability and peace come to their land

 and there be another more profound reason in viet nam communism seek to really impose its will by force of arm but we would be deeply mistaken to think that this be the only weapon here as other place in the world they speak to restless people people rise to shatter the old way which have imprison hope people fiercely and justly reach for the material fruit from the tree of modern knowledge

 it be this desire and not simply lust for conquest which move many of the individual fight man that we must now sadly call the enemy

 it be therefore our task to show that freedom from the control of other nation offer the sure road to progress that history and experience testify to this truth but it be not enough to call upon reason or point to example we must show it through action and we must show it through accomplishment

 and even be there no war either hot or cold we would always be active in humanity 's search for progress this task be command to we by the moral value of our civilization and it rest on the inescapable nature of the world that we have now enter for in that world as long as we can foresee every threat to man 's welfare will be a threat to the welfare of our own people those who live in the emerge community of nation will ignore the peril of their neighbor at the risk of their own prospect

 this be true not only for viet nam but for every part of the develop world this be why on your behalf i recently propose a massive cooperative development effort for all of southeast asia i name the respected leader eugene black as my personal representative to inaugurate our participation in these program

 since that time rapid progress have be make i be glad to report mr. black have meet with the top official of the united nations on several occasion he have talk to other interested party he have find increase enthusiasm the united nations be already set up new mechanism to help carry forward the work of development

 in addition the united states be now prepared to participate in and to support an asian development bank to carry out and help finance the economic progress in that area of the world and the development that we desire to see in that area of the world so this morning i call on every other industrialized nation include the soviet union to help create a well life for all of the people of southeast asia

 surely surely the work of peace can bring man together in a common effort to abandon forever the work of war

 but as south viet nam be the central place of conflict it be also a principal focus of our work to increase the well being of people

 it be in that effort in south viet nam which i think we be too little informed and which i want to relate to you this morning

 we begin in 1954 when viet nam become independent before the war between the north and the south

 since that time we have spend more than $ 2 billion in economic help for the 16 million people of south viet nam

 and despite the ravage of war we have make steady continue gain

 we have concentrate on food and health and education and housing and industry

 like most develop country south viet nam 's economy rest on agriculture unlike many it have large uncrowded area of very rich and very fertile land because of this it be one of the great rice bowl of the entire world with our help since 1954 south viet nam have already double its rice production provide food for the people as well as provide a vital export for that nation

 we have put our american farm know how to work on other crop this year for instance several hundred million cutting of a new variety of sweet potato that promise a sixfold increase in yield will be distribute to these vietnamese farmer corn output should rise from 25,000 ton in 1962 to 100,000 ton by 1966 pig production have more than double since 1955 many animal disease have be eliminate entirely

 disease and epidemic brood over every vietnamese village in a country of more than 16 million people with a life expectancy of only 35 year there be only 200 civilian doctor if the vietnamese have doctor in the same ratio as the united states have doctor they would have not the 200 that they do have but they would have more than 5,000 doctor

 we have help vaccinate already over 7 million people against cholera and million more against other disease hundred of thousand of vietnamese can now receive treatment in the more than 12,000 hamlet health station that america have build and have stock new clinic and surgical suite be scatter throughout that entire country and the medical school that we be now help to build will graduate as many doctor in a single year as now serve the entire population of south viet nam

 education be the keystone of future development in viet nam it take a train people to man the factory to conduct the administration to form the human foundation for an advance nation more than a quarter million young vietnamese can now learn in more than 4,000 classroom that america have help to build in the last 2 year and 2,000 more school be go to be build by we in the next 12 month the number of student in vocational school have go up four time enrollment be 300,000 in 1955 when we first enter there and start help with our program today it be more than 1 1/2 million

 the 8 million textbook that we have supply to vietnamese child will rise to more than 15 million by 1967 agriculture be the foundation

 health education and housing be the urgent human need

 but industrial development be the great pathway to their future

 when viet nam be divide most of the industry be in the north

 the south be barren of manufacturing and the foundation for industry but today more than 700 new or rehabilitated factory textile mill and cement plant electronic and plastic be change the entire face of that nation new road and communication railroad equipment and electric generator be a spread base on which this new industry can and be grow

 all this progress go on and it be go to continue to go on under circumstance of staggering adversity

 communist terrorist have make aid program that we administer a very special target of their attack they fear they they know they must fear they because agricultural station be be destroy and medical center be be burn more than 100 vietnamese malaria fighter be dead our own aid official have be wound and kill and kidnap

 these be not just the accident of war they be a part of a deliberate campaign in the word of the communists themselves to cut the finger off the hand of the government

 we intend to continue and we intend to increase our help to viet nam

 nor can anyone doubt the determination of the south vietnamese themselves they have lose more than 12,000 of their man since i become your president a little over a year ago

 but progress do not come from investment alone or plan on a desk or even the directive and the order that we approve here in washington it take man

 man must take the seed to the farmer man must teach the use of fertilizer man must help in harvest

 man must build the school and man must instruct the student

 man must carry medicine into the jungle and treat the sick and shelter the homeless

 and man brave tireless fill with love for their fellow be do this today they be do it through the long hot danger fill vietnamese day and the sultry night

 the full glory must go also to those south vietnamese that be labor and die for their own people and their own nation in hospital and school along the rice field and the road they continue to labor never know when death or terror may strike

 how incredible it be that there be a few who still say that the south vietnamese do not want to continue this struggle they be sacrifice and they be die by the thousand their patient valor in the heavy presence of personal physical danger should be a helpful lesson to those of we who here in america only have to read about it or hear about it on the television or radio

 we have our own hero who labor at the work of peace in the midst of war they toil unarmed and out of uniform they know the humanity of their concern do not exempt they from the horror of conflict yet they go on from day to day they bring food to the hungry over there they supply the sick with necessary medicine they help the farmer with his crop family to find clean water village to receive the heal miracle of electricity these be americans who have join our aid program and we welcome other to their rank

 for most americans this be an easy war man fight and man suffer and man die as they always must in war but the life of most of we at least those of we in this room and those listen to i this morning be untroubled prosperity rise abundance increase the nation flourish

 i will report to the cabinet when i leave this room that we be in the 51st month of continued prosperity the long peacetime prosperity for america since our country be found yet our entire future be at stake

 what a difference it would make if we could only call upon a small fraction of our unmatched private resource business and union agricultural group and builder if we could call they to the task of peaceful progress in viet nam with such a spirit of patriotic sacrifice we might well strike an irresistible blow for freedom there and for freedom throughout the world

 i therefore hope that every person within the sound of my voice in this country this morning will look for way and those citizen of other nation who believe in humanity as we do i hope that they will find way to help progress in south viet nam

 this then be the third face of our struggle in viet nam it be there the illiterate the hungry the sick before this war begin it will be there when peace come to us and so will we not with soldier and plane not with bomb and bullet but with all the wondrous weapon of peace in the 30th century

 and then perhaps together all of the people in the world can share that gracious task with all the people of viet nam north and south alike

 thank you for come this morning good morning

the president good afternoon lady and gentleman

 the situation in the dominican republic continue to be serious that be why we welcome the additional effort which be be make in the oas today to enlarge and to strengthen the effort to find a peaceful settlement there we continue to give our full support to secretary general mora 1 in his outstanding service under exist oas resolution but we share his judgment that a very strong and sustained effort be go to continue to be need

 meanwhile i have be advise today by general alvim the commander in chief of the inter american force and by lieutenant general palmer the deputy commander of the inter american force that condition in the dominican republic will now permit the further withdrawal of the united states military personnel from the inter american force this recommendation have the concurrence of secretary general mora and ambassador bennett

 i be therefore accordingly order the immediate withdrawal of one battalion land team of united states marines plus headquarters and support personnel this will total approximately 2,000 people

 now to another subject

 this month of june mark a very historic anniversary in the affair of man twenty year ago while war still rage in the world the nation of europe assemble at san francisco to sign the charter of hope that bring into be the united nations man be mindful that in these time humankind must choose between cooperation or catastrophe

 at san francisco there be bring into be a great instrumentality for international cooperation and we can believe today that the cooperation engender by the united nations have help to avert catastrophe in this century so today we have to work not on the thing that divide we but instead on the thing that unite nation in the bond of common interest

 on june 24th 25th and 26th of this year the general assembly of the united nations will meet for commemorative session in san francisco it be my hope and plan at this time to be in san francisco and to address the delegate at that time during the meeting of the session there

 this afternoon i be send to the congress a very special message request an additional appropriation to help in the peaceful economic and social development of southeast asia this be another forward step toward carry out my april proposal for a massive effort to improve the life of man in that conflict tear corner of the world

 the american people i think want their own government to be not only strong but compassionate they know that a society be secure only when there be full social justice for all of its people and these principle of compassion and justice never stop at the water 's edge

 so we do not intend that the enemy of freedom shall become the inheritor of man 's worldwide revolt against injustice and misery therefore we expect to lead in that struggle not to conquer or to subdue but to give each people the chance to build its own nation in its own way

 my personal representative mr. eugene black have already begin extensive and hopeful discussion with interested party around the world thus the groundwork have already be lay for a long range development plan for all of southeast asia lead by asians to improve the life of asians

 in south viet nam today brave and endure people be carry on a determined resistance against those who would destroy their independence they will win this fight and the united states of america be go to help they win it

 but there be another and a much more profound struggle go on in that country and that be the struggle to create the condition of hope and progress which be really the only lasting guarantee of peace and stability

 the 16 million people of south viet nam survive on an average income of $ 100 per year more than 60 percent of the people have never learn to read or write when disease strike medical care be often impossible to find

 as i remark the other day here there be only one doctor for every 29,000 people compare with one for every 740 in the united states they have 200 doctor whereas they need 5,000 this poverty and this neglect take their inevitable toll in human life the life expectancy there be only 35 year that be just about half what it be in our country

 now we think that these be the common enemy of man in south viet nam they be there before the aggressor strike they of course will be there when aggression be completely go these enemy too we be committed to help defeat

 today 's request will be use to help develop the vast water and power resource of the mekong basin they will be use to bring electricity to small town in the province we have have rea team as you know there work for several week make these survey and plan to build several rea system

 we will build clinic and provide doctor for disease ride rural area we will help south viet nam import material for their home and their factory and in addition the member of the american medical association have already agree with we to try to recruit surgeon and specialist approximately 50 of they we be particularly very much in need of plastic surgeon to go to viet nam to help heal the wound of war and to help they as well to deal with the ravage of unchecked disease

 now this be just a part of the beginning this appropriation today call for only $ 89 million but in the future i will call upon our people to make further sacrifice because this be a good program and the start that we be make today be good start this be the only way that i know in which we can really win not only the military battle against aggression but the wide war for the freedom and for progress of all man

 now i will be glad to take any question you may have

 q. mr. president in your speech at baylor on friday you speak of new international machinery be need to counteract any future aggression or subversion in this hemisphere could you spell out in any further detail just what your concept of this be militarily or diplomatically

 the president yes i think that we be very delighted that for the first time in history we have presently on the military side an inter american force that be function and function effectively under the leadership of general alvim in the dominican republic a good many of the nation in this hemisphere be supply force to that inter american force and other will be make contribution we hope in the next few day

 on the political side we be now consider the organization of american states certain solution for the dominican republic which could very well serve as an indication of what might come in similar situation down the road we have have very enlighten and very positive leadership under mr. mora the secretary general of the oas in the dominican republic and we hope not only can they supply force to help provide the military answer to the necessity in that field but that they can evolve a formula that will provide judicious determination in connection with political judgment that we need to make in the near future

 u.s. efforts in the dominican republic q. mr. president could you spell out for we sir the effort and role that the united states have be play in seek a compromise government in the dominican republic and what you think the chance for success be

 the president yes i will be very glad to we find it necessary in order to preserve our own citizen life and in order to stop the wholesale killing of hundred and even thousand of dominicans to intervene in the dominican republic since that time we have counsel at great length and seek the assistance of the oas in connection with contribute the military force that would bring about a cease fire and preserve the peace

 at the same time we have urge the oas to establish machinery to help find a political solution and await the establishment of that machinery which we be really consider in the oas today we have send some of the good people in this government to maintain contact with the broad base of leadership in the dominican republic in the hope that there would in due time evolve a broadly base government that would meet with the approval of the dominican people

 i have have mr. vance mr. bundy mr. mann mr. vaughn,6 and other maintain liaison with various leader of various group there those conference have be take place from day to day and we have be keep the oas and their representative fully inform we be hopeful that in due time they will reach conclusion as to how they think it can be well handle and that we will be able to contribute our part and cooperate with they as you know they be discuss the matter over the weekend and today and we hope that a decision will be in the offing in the immediate future

 we have no desire to insist upon our particular brand of military solution or political solution we think it be an inter american matter and we want to cooperate fully with they prior to our intervention we consult and discuss the gravity of the situation there with 14 latin american nation begin on saturday when the revolution take place up through wednesday when we send the marines in

 during that same period we meet with the peace committee of the oas on tuesday and we meet with the oas council on wednesday it have be our desire all along to contribute all we could to a cease fire to the eventual evolution of a stable government that would be broadly base and to make our appropriate contribution to the necessary reconstruction of that country

 we feel that when the oas reach its decision that that decision will be communicate to the people of the dominican republic we hope that they will be able to find agreement between the inter american body and the folk there that will ultimately lead to an expression of opinion by the people of the dominican republic and ultimately lead to a broadly base government that will include none of the extreme

 q. mr. president do you feel mayor wagner should run again

 the president i think that be a matter not for the president to determine

 q. mr. president do you think that the attack which have be make on oas secretary general mora in the dominican republic may have undermine his usefulness as a peace negotiator

 the president no i do not think so i think it may have have that objective in mind that may have be its purpose but you know the old story when a man get in the role of a mediator both side usually hit at he but we think as i say in my opening statement that the secretary general have perform a very useful role a very intelligent one and a very objective one and we have every confidence in his effort we have regret to see the attack come upon he as we have regret to see the attack come upon we but we much prefer the attack to what could have happen except for our action and except for his action

 q. mr. president this morning sir you say we welcome and ask for new idea in foreign policy from university and journal and public platform across the land two question sir do this mean you approve of the university teach in technique and what be your view of dissent comment on viet nam and other foreign problem

 the president i will answer the latter question first i think that this administration profit from the suggestion and recommendation of leader in other branch of government from man who occupy public platform from general discussion i think that be the strength of the american system instead of a weakness i be hopeful that every person will always exercise the free speech that the constitution guarantee he and i would prefer of course that it be constructive and it be responsible and i think generally that have be true

 i be glad that i live in a nation where in the midst of conflict when man be die to preserve our freedom that our citizen still do not fear to exercise it and i can assure you that they do exercise it

 q. mr. president there have be a flare up of the fighting in viet nam could you give we an estimate of the situation there the military situation

 the president we have anticipate that we would have some action of this type at this season of the year we have have a rather serious engagement in the last few hour in the most immediate past the south vietnamese have lose accord to the report we have dozen even hundred of people

 we do not know exactly the extent of the viet cong loss although we believe they to be substantial we do not announce those perhaps unfortunately along with the announcement of our own loss we know how many we lose but we do not know how many they lose until we get out there and count they so their loss never really catch up with the original story of our loss

 suffice it to say i think it have be serious we be concerned about it it be occupy our attention as you know general taylor plan to be here in the next few day and he will probably have more definite information at that time just about the detail of this particular engagement

 q. mr. president sir last month when you speak to the nation on the dominican republic you indicate that the threat of communist control of the rebel movement be very serious more recently we have include the rebel leader in these talk for coalition do you feel that the communist threat in the dominican republic be now over

 the president oh no if you want i to elaborate on that a little bit i will say that the threat be great before 21,000 americans arrive there it always be the communists do not in our judgment originate this revolution but they join it and south viet nam they participate in it they be active in it and in a good many place they be in charge of it

 we think that follow the action that this nation take it serve a very good purpose and some of the man who have originally participate in the revolution and have to take asylum return and more moderate force take leadership the communist element have not be so active although their presence be still note hour by hour their effectiveness be still observe from day to day we see their handiwork in the dominican republic and elsewhere throughout the world particularly in the propaganda field

 q. mr. president do you foresee that an inter american peace force which may be set up permanently would be use only to suppress communist direct revolutionary movement in latin america or would it also be use to thwart revolution by military junta which be attempt to destroy elect government

 i would also like to ask in view of the precedent which may be create by such a force would you look with favor upon the creation of similar regional force in such area as africa and the arab world

 the president i would not want to anticipate what action the oas be go to take

 q. mr. president today the supreme court hand down several decision in reapportionment case in line with its doctrine of one man one vote however as you know there be several proposal already introduce in congress for constitutional amendment which would nullify this doctrine in part could you tell we what your administration 's position be on this legislation

 the president the president do not take action in connection with constitutional amendment i have review some of the proposal that have be make i be generally sympathetic with the reapportionment take place throughout the country in compliance with the supreme court 's decision i would not want to get into detailed discussion of the individual program about which the president will not act one way or the other because a constitutional amendment do not require white house action it be a matter for the representative of the people to decide

 in submit it the congress take that action the people themselves have an opportunity to judge it when the congress do get down to debate the question and consider it i will of course spend some time on it and become thoroughly conversant with it but i would not want to predict at this time just what measure would emerge in the form of an amendment or what action congress or the people might take on it

 q. mr. president the astronaut flight on thursday be go to have more maneuvering than be originally announce be this increase do at your suggestion or urging sir

 the president no

 q. mr. president if the situation in viet nam in which you have promise the united states to help that country achieve victory become such that american combat troop be use in the combat there would you give that order sir in the event that there be an invasion from the north

 the president i do not see that i can do you any good the country any good or myself any good by discuss future operational plan i know of no real reason why we ought to photograph they or decide they until we be confront with that possibility

 q. mr. president in connection with your statement on the united nations the secretary general of the u.n. have express the apprehension that the oas action in the dominican republic might have establish i think what he call an embarrassing precedent that the arab league might act in its region and the african state might act in theirs i be wonder whether you share those apprehension about the u.n.

 the president i do not

 q. mr. president some person claim that you have enunciate a new johnson doctrine under which american troop would be use to prevent the establishment of a communist government anywhere in the western hemisphere in send american troop to santo domingo and explain your action afterwards do you have any such purpose in mind

 the president no i be afraid that the people that have brand the johnson doctrine be unfamiliar with the fact that the nation of this hemisphere have repeatedly make it clear that the principle of communism be incompatible with the principle of the inter american system just as president kennedy make it abundantly clear that be the basis of our own attitude on the matter as i explain in my television appearance

 that do not mean of course that this government be oppose to change the great purpose of the alliance for progress which we be work on so hard and make such substantial contribution to be to encourage economic and social change we believe that will benefit all the people of this hemisphere we be do our good to provide encouragement for those change but i think it be a well know and well advertise doctrine of the hemisphere that the principle of communism be incompatible with the principle of our inter american system president kennedy enunciate that on several occasion the oas itself have enunciate that i merely repeat it i be sorry i get some folk excite by it

 q. mr. president i would like to ask you two question about the dominican rebellion one deal with its origin and one deal with the possible future do you think that it would have be helpful if juan bosch have return and do you think he might have exercise a restrain influence on some of the left wing extremist or communists who be in there and secondly--

 the president i will answer your first one i do not want to get into personality go ahead

 q. on the second one regard the future do you think it would be useful if the dominicans be to follow the example of the founding fathers in this country and hold a constitutional convention themselves to talk out some of their difference before they try to set up a new government

 the president we have take several step in the order of priority that we feel be require many month ago we become aware of the increase tension there and the difficulty that would likely confront we on the sunday before we go in there on wednesday we ask the ambassador who have already come to washington at our calling to leave his family 's home and come here to meet with we

 ambassador bennett meet with we on monday we rush he back to the dominican republic and set in motion certain step

 first be to attempt to obtain a cease fire second be to take the precautionary step necessary to protect approximately 5,000 americans as well as thousand of other national if that should be require we move our ship up there on sunday

 the ambassador arrive there on monday he talk to various leader we do all we could to bring about a cease fire in cooperation with the papal nuncio and other who be active on the scene on wednesday at noon it become apparent that danger be lurk around the corner and the ambassador give we a warning in a cable about 1 o'clock

 we have meet on monday and we have meet on tuesday we have meet on wednesday and we have have many conversation on sunday that we do not issue any handout on during that period i think from the time we be notify on saturday until we intervene on wednesday we spend a good part of both day and night give our attention to this matter from move the ship up to make the final decision

 i have 237 individual conversation during that period and about 35 meeting with various people finally on wednesday afternoon at 4 something we get another warning that we should have a contingent plan ready immediately and a little before 6 o'clock we get a plea a unanimous plea from the entire country team make up of the ambassador the aid director cia and the usia and the army navy and the air force to land troop immediately to save american life

 now of course we know of the force at work in the dominican republic we be not unaware that there be communists that be active in this effort but 99 percent of our reason for go in there be to try to provide protection for these american life and for the life of other national we ask our ambassador to summon all our people immediately to the ambassador hotel to put they in one central group in the presence of secretary rusk secretary mcnamara secretary ball,10 mr. bundy and mr. moyers11 of my staff we consult with the latin american desk mr. vaughn and his expert and mr. vance and the joint chiefs of staff

 in the neighborhood of 6 o'clock wednesday evening we make the decision it be a unanimous decision about which there be no difference of opinion either at the dominican republic level or the country team or the cabinet level here to send in the troop we do not want to announce that they be on their way until they have land for obvious security reason but when i make the decision i point out to the secretary of state that we have be consult since the weekend with some 14 latin american nation that we have have a meeting of the peace committee of the oas and we have have a meeting of the council of the oas i think it be very important that we notify all the latin american ambassadors forthwith

 so the decision be to notify the congress and ask they to come down so we could review with they development notify the ambassador and ask for an immediate session of the oas and to notify the troop because the life of our citizen be in danger

 man be run up and down the corridor of the ambassador hotel with tommy gun shoot out window and through the roof and through the closet our citizen be under the bed and in the closet and try to dodge this gunfire our ambassador as he be talk to we be under the desk we do not think we have much time to consult in any great detail more than we have talk about up to that time but we do make the announcement about 8 o'clock and immediately ask the oas for an urgent meeting the next morning

 since that time we have have two purpose in mind one be for they to take action that would give we a military presence and provide a military solution so that we could quit kill people i think that the armed forces be entitle to one of the great tribute ever pay that group in war or peace for the marvelous operation they conduct they move in there and land within an hour from the time the commander in chief make the decision they surround the hotel and protect the life of a thousand american citizen and many hundred of other national they do not lose one civilian they open the route of 7 mile to the port and they evacuate 5,600 people those people come from 46 different country

 the next step that we think should be follow be to provide food and clothing and sustenance for those people so we send an economic team of 32 people head by mr. solomon,12 who be swear in today as assistant under secretary of state in charge of economic matter and we start feed the 3 million people of the dominican republic we have provide food and other necessity medicine since that time to those people without regard to which side they be on

 in addition we have treat more than 15,000 with our medical facility

 so having go in and secure the place having evacuate 5,600 people and now the commercial plane be run and they can come out on their own stint having obtain a cease fire having provide the economic aid having send our good people there to talk to all group and all faction and leadership to try to find a government that would appeal to all the dominican people we now think that there be two essential thing that be leave to be do one be to find a broadly base government under the leadership of the oas that will be acceptable and approve by the dominican people and second to engage in the comprehensive task of reconstruction of that nation in try to make it possible for 3 1/2 million to have an economic comeback

 thank you mr. president





dr. nabrit my fellow americans

 i be delighted at the chance to speak at this important and this historic institution howard have long be an outstanding center for the education of negro americans its student be of every race and color and they come from many country of the world it be truly a work example of democratic excellence

 our earth be the home of revolution in every corner of every continent man charge with hope contend with ancient way in the pursuit of justice they reach for the new of weapon to realize the old of dream that each may walk in freedom and pride stretch his talent enjoy the fruit of the earth

 our enemy may occasionally seize the day of change but it be the banner of our revolution they take and our own future be link to this process of swift and turbulent change in many land in the world but nothing in any country touch we more profoundly and nothing be more freight with meaning for our own destiny than the revolution of the negro american

 in far too many way american negroes have be another nation deprive of freedom cripple by hatred the door of opportunity close to hope

 in our time change have come to this nation too the american negro act with impressive restraint have peacefully protest and march enter the courtroom and the seat of government demand a justice that have long be deny the voice of the negro be the call to action but it be a tribute to america that once arouse the court and the congress the president and most of the people have be the ally of progress

 thus we have see the high court of the country declare that discrimination base on race be repugnant to the constitution and therefore void we have see in 1957 and 1960 and again in 1964 the first civil right legislation in this nation in almost an entire century

 as majority leader of the united states senate i help to guide two of these bill through the senate and as your president i be proud to sign the third and now very soon we will have the fourth a new law guarantee every american the right to vote

 no act of my entire administration will give i great satisfaction than the day when my signature make this bill too the law of this land

 the voting right bill will be the late and among the most important in a long series of victory but this victory as winston churchill say of another triumph for freedom—"is not the end it be not even the beginning of the end but it be perhaps the end of the beginning

 that beginning be freedom and the barrier to that freedom be tumble down freedom be the right to share share fully and equally in american society to vote to hold a job to enter a public place to go to school it be the right to be treat in every part of our national life as a person equal in dignity and promise to all other

 but freedom be not enough you do not wipe away the scar of century by say now you be free to go where you want and do as you desire and choose the leader you please

 you do not take a person who for year have be hobble by chain and liberate he bring he up to the starting line of a race and then say you be free to compete with all the other and still justly believe that you have be completely fair

 thus it be not enough just to open the gate of opportunity all our citizen must have the ability to walk through those gate

 this be the next and the more profound stage of the battle for civil right we seek not just freedom but opportunity we seek not just legal equity but human ability not just equality as a right and a theory but equality as a fact and equality as a result

 for the task be to give 20 million negroes the same chance as every other american to learn and grow to work and share in society to develop their ability physical mental and spiritual and to pursue their individual happiness

 to this end equal opportunity be essential but not enough not enough man and woman of all race be bear with the same range of ability but ability be not just the product of birth ability be stretch or stunt by the family that you live with and the neighborhood you live in by the school you go to and the poverty or the richness of your surrounding it be the product of a hundred unseen force play upon the little infant the child and finally the man

 this graduating class at howard university be witness to the indomitable determination of the negro american to win his way in american life

 the number of negroes in school of high learning have almost double in 15 year the number of nonwhite professional worker have more than double in 10 year the median income of negro college woman tonight exceed that of white college woman and there be also the enormous accomplishment of distinguished individual negro many of they graduate of this institution and one of they the first lady ambassador in the history of the united states

 these be proud and impressive achievement but they tell only the story of a grow middle class minority steadily narrow the gap between they and their white counterpart

 but for the great majority of negro americans the poor the unemployed the uprooted and the dispossess there be a much grimmer story they still as we meet here tonight be another nation despite the court order and the law despite the legislative victory and the speech for they the wall be rise and the gulf be widen

 here be some of the fact of this american failure

 thirty five year ago the rate of unemployment for negroes and white be about the same tonight the negro rate be twice as high

 in 1948 the 8 percent unemployment rate for negro teenage boy be actually less than that of white by last year that rate have grow to 23 percent as against 13 percent for white unemployed

 between 1949 and 1959 the income of negro man relative to white man decline in every section of this country from 1952 to 1963 the median income of negro family compare to white actually drop from 57 percent to 53 percent

 in the year 1955 through 1957 22 percent of experienced negro worker be out of work at some time during the year in 1961 through 1963 that proportion have soar to 29 percent

 since 1947 the number of white family live in poverty have decrease 27 percent while the number of poor nonwhite family decrease only 3 percent

 the infant mortality of nonwhite in 1940 be 70 percent great than white twenty two year later it be 90 percent great

 moreover the isolation of negro from white community be increase rather than decrease as negroes crowd into the central city and become a city within a city

 of course negro americans as well as white americans have share in our rise national abundance but the harsh fact of the matter be that in the battle for true equality too many far too many be lose ground every day

 we be not completely sure why this be we know the cause be complex and subtle but we do know the two broad basic reason and we do know that we have to act

 first negroes be trap as many white be trap in inherit gate less poverty they lack training and skill they be shut in in slum without decent medical care private and public poverty combine to cripple their capacity

 we be try to attack these evil through our poverty program through our education program through our medical care and our other health program and a dozen more of the great society program that be aim at the root cause of this poverty

 we will increase and we will accelerate and we will broaden this attack in year to come until this most enduring of foe finally yield to our unyielding will

 but there be a second cause much more difficult to explain more deeply ground more desperate in its force it be the devastating heritage of long year of slavery and a century of oppression hatred and injustice

 for negro poverty be not white poverty many of its cause and many of its cure be the same but there be difference deep corrosive obstinate difference radiate painful root into the community and into the family and the nature of the individual

 these difference be not racial difference they be solely and simply the consequence of ancient brutality past injustice and present prejudice they be anguish to observe for the negro they be a constant reminder of oppression for the white they be a constant reminder of guilt but they must be face and they must be deal with and they must be overcome if we be ever to reach the time when the only difference between negroes and white be the color of their skin

 nor can we find a complete answer in the experience of other american minority they make a valiant and a largely successful effort to emerge from poverty and prejudice

 the negro like these other will have to rely mostly upon his own effort but he just can not do it alone for they do not have the heritage of century to overcome and they do not have a cultural tradition which have be twist and batter by endless year of hatred and hopelessness nor be they exclude these other because of race or color a feeling whose dark intensity be match by no other prejudice in our society

 nor can these difference be understand as isolated infirmity they be a seamless web they cause each other they result from each other they reinforce each other

 much of the negro community be bury under a blanket of history and circumstance it be not a lasting solution to lift just one corner of that blanket we must stand on all side and we must raise the entire cover if we be to liberate our fellow citizen

 one of the difference be the increase concentration of negroes in our city more than 73 percent of all negro live in urban area compare with less than 70 percent of the white most of these negro live in slum most of these negro live together a separated people

 man be shape by their world when it be a world of decay ring by an invisible wall when escape be arduous and uncertain and the save pressure of a more hopeful society be unknown it can cripple the youth and it can desolate the man

 there be also the burden that a dark skin can add to the search for a productive place in our society unemployment strike most swiftly and broadly at the negro and this burden erode hope blighted hope breed despair despair bring indifference to the learning which offer a way out and despair couple with indifference be often the source of destructive rebellion against the fabric of society

 there be also the lacerate hurt of early collision with white hatred or prejudice distaste or condescension other group have feel similar intolerance but success and achievement could wipe it away they do not change the color of a man 's skin i have see this uncomprehende pain in the eye of the little young mexican american schoolchildren that i teach many year ago but it can be overcome but for many the wound be always open

 perhaps most important its influence radiate to every part of life be the breakdown of the negro family structure for this most of all white america must accept responsibility it flow from century of oppression and persecution of the negro man it flow from the long year of degradation and discrimination which have attack his dignity and assault his ability to produce for his family

 this too be not pleasant to look upon but it must be face by those whose serious intent be to improve the life of all americans

 only a minority less than half of all negro child reach the age of 18 having live all their life with both of their parent at this moment tonight little less than two third be at home with both of their parent probably a majority of all negro child receive federally aid public assistance sometime during their childhood

 the family be the cornerstone of our society more than any other force it shape the attitude the hope the ambition and the value of the child and when the family collapse it be the child that be usually damage when it happen on a massive scale the community itself be crippled

 so unless we work to strengthen the family to create condition under which most parent will stay together all the rest school and playground and public assistance and private concern will never be enough to cut completely the circle of despair and deprivation

 there be no single easy answer to all of these problem

 job be part of the answer they bring the income which permit a man to provide for his family

 decent home in decent surrounding and a chance to learn an equal chance to learn be part of the answer

 welfare and social program well design to hold family together be part of the answer

 care for the sick be part of the answer

 an understand heart by all americans be another big part of the answer

 and to all of these front and a dozen more i will dedicate the expand effort of the johnson administration

 but there be other answer that be still to be find nor do we fully understand even all of the problem therefore i want to announce tonight that this fall i intend to call a white house conference of scholar and expert and outstanding negro leader man of both race and official of government at every level

 this white house conference 's theme and title will be to fulfill these rights

 its object will be to help the american negro fulfill the right which after the long time of injustice he be finally about to secure

 to move beyond opportunity to achievement

 to shatter forever not only the barrier of law and public practice but the wall which bind the condition of many by the color of his skin

 to dissolve as good we can the antique enmity of the heart which diminish the holder divide the great democracy and do wrong great wrong to the child of god

 and i pledge you tonight that this will be a chief goal of my administration and of my program next year and in the year to come and i hope and i pray and i believe it will be a part of the program of all america

 for what be justice

 it be to fulfill the fair expectation of man

 thus american justice be a very special thing for from the first this have be a land of tower expectation it be to be a nation where each man could be rule by the common consent of all enshrine in law give life by institution guide by man themselves subject to its rule and all all of every station and origin would be touch equally in obligation and in liberty

 beyond the law lie the land it be a rich land glow with more abundant promise than man have ever see here unlike any place yet know all be to share the harvest

 and beyond this be the dignity of man each could become whatever his quality of mind and spirit would permit to strive to seek and if he could to find his happiness

 this be american justice we have pursue it faithfully to the edge of our imperfection and we have fail to find it for the american negro

 so it be the glorious opportunity of this generation to end the one huge wrong of the american nation and in so do to find america for ourselves with the same immense thrill of discovery which grip those who first begin to realize that here at last be a home for freedom

 all it will take be for all of we to understand what this country be and what this country must become

 the scripture promise i shall light a candle of understanding in thine heart which shall not be put out

 together and with million more we can light that candle of understanding in the heart of all america

 and once light it will never again go out

mr. webb dr. dryden dr. seamans my fellow americans

 monday be a very happy day for you and for the nation but this opportunity to visit with all the member of america 's space team be no anticlimax for i

 so to each of you who contribute to the success of america 's most historic peacetime adventure i be proud and i be privileged to say to each and to all of you well do

 the television commentator and the newspaper writer have all have a good bit to say about the sterling quality and virtue of major mcdivitt and major white of course i have detect a certain great objectivity in the remark make publicly by both of their lovely wife

 be that as it may what impress and gratify i most about these two hero and all of the other astronaut be the quality of personal modesty and humility

 i have not yet meet a man who have not come down from space want to give more credit to all the man and woman on the ground than he would accept for himself up there

 ed and jim be no exception

 i invite they to bring their family to the ranch tomorrow or the next day because i want to present both of they with a token of their country 's great esteem and respect but i learn last night from the administrator mr. webb that both man feel a ceremony at the ranch would focus too much credit on they and exclude all of you who support their flight here so impressively at this new nasa spacecenter in houston

 so we have arrange our plan gladly to come here with one proviso a little later next week or the early part of the follow week we expect to see the mcdivitts and their three child and the whites and their two child and the manager of the gemini program mr. mathews and his family in washington at the white house

 at that time we be go to pay they the honor all of you know they deserve no matter what they say about it

 but today as i say to you when we be talk a few hour ago i promise to bring these two hero a little token well i be go to keep my promise i be nominate major mcdivitt and major white for promotion to the rank of lieutenant colonel for their spectacular achievement on behalf of all the people of their country and the free world and i be say also that that be something you can eat as well as wear

 incidentally i might announce today that maj gordon cooper will be promote on july 15th to the rank of lieutenant colonel and i be not go to forget the fourth air force astronaut to make an orbital flight so i complete my announcement today by nominate maj gus grissom for promotion to lieutenant colonel also

 when our manned space program begin many say about space what man probably say 500 year before about america itself that the environment be hostile that the climate be no good that there be nothing there worth the trip anyway these two young americans have change that conception forever

 all people have a new sense of thrill and excitement and anticipation about space exploration because of the flight of gemini 4

 the joy and the thrill and the exhilaration that ed white experience on his walk from the pacific ocean to the atlantic run through the vein of we all our attitude about space will never entirely be the same again

 and let i make one other observation i read with mixed emotion yesterday that major white have decide to claim this state of his birth as his home state well as president i be suppose to be neutral on matter of state pride but the glimmer of pride i allow myself to feel be subdue just a bit i know some will say that as soon as americans get themselves up into space a texan have to go and put his foot in it

 seriously i hope that the clear and obvious meaning and promise of this great adventure which all of you have really share will not be lose upon mankind

 only a few year ago this great nation be unmistakably behind in space abroad and at home some prophesy that america would remain behind that our system have fail that the brightness of our future have dim and would grow dark but no such prophecy be hear today

 proceed openly openly admit our failure openly share and offer to share our success the united states of america have proceed with the determination and the zeal that burn in the heart of man who love liberty and today we know that america 's success be very great indeed

 all that we have accomplish in space all that we may accomplish in day and year to come we stand ready to share for the benefit of all mankind whether we stand first in these endeavor matter to our momentary pride but not to our continue and permanent purpose the race in which we of this generation be determined to be first be the race for peace in the world

 in the labor of peace as in the exploration of space let no man in any land doubt for a moment that we have the will and the determination and the talent and the resource require to stay the course and see those labor through

 so i would end this week as i begin it last sunday morning say to all nation and all people east and west that we of america a strong a confident a proud and a peaceful america invite you to open your curtain come through the doorway and the wall that you have build and join with we to walk together toward peace for all people on this earth

 thank you

 thank you colonel mcdivitt and thank you colonel white

 i just want to say this before i look at your center that i conduct the first investigation in the space field as a member of the senate and as i look out over this group today and this great installation that just do not exist those few year ago i think of what jim webb and dr. dryden have say 4 year ago or more when they leave my office the first day they be to undertake this assignment i see dr. seamans and dr. gilruth here today and all of the thousand of people who have participate in this great adventure

 you do not know the gratitude i feel to each of you and how proud i be of all of you

 thank you



 mr. president mr. secretary general your excellencies distinguished representative governor brown lady and gentleman

 on my journey across the continent i stop in the state of missouri and there i meet with the man who make the first such pilgrimage here 20 year ago as the 33d president of the united states harry s. truman

 mr. truman send to this assembly his greeting and good wish on this anniversary commemoration he ask that i express to you for he as for myself and for my countryman the faith which we of the united states hold firmly in the united nations and in the ultimate success of its mission among man

 on this historic and happy occasion we have meet to celebrate 20 year of achievement and to look together at the work that we face in future meeting i come to this anniversary not to speak of futility or failure nor of doubt and despair i come to raise a voice of confidence in both the future of these united nations and the fate of the human race

 the movement of history be glacial on two decade of experience none can presume to speak with certainty of the direction or the destiny of man 's affair but this we do know and this we do believe

 futility and failure be not the truth of this organization bring into be here 20 year ago

 where historically man have move fitfully from war toward war in these last two decade man have move steadily away from war as either an instrument of national policy or a means of international decision

 many factor have contribute to this change but no one single factor have contribute more than the existence and the enterprise of the united nations itself

 for there can be no doubt that the united nations have take root in human need and have establish a shape and a purpose and a meaning of its own

 by provide a forum for the opinion of the world the united nations have give they a force and an influence that they have never have before by shine the light of inquiry and discussion upon very dark and isolated conflict it have press the nation of the world to conform their course to the requirement of the united nations charter

 and let all remember and none forget that now more than 50 time in these an year the united nations have act to keep the peace

 by persuade nation to justify their own conduct before all country it have help at many time and in many place to soften the harshness of man to his fellow man

 by confront the rich with the misery of the poor and the privileged with the despair of the oppress it have remove the excuse of ignorance unmask the evil of indifference and have place an insistent even though still unfulfilled responsibility upon the more fortunate of the earth

 by insist upon the political dignity of man it have welcome 63 nation to take their place alongside the 51 original member a historical development of dramatic import achieve mainly through peaceful mean

 and by bind country together in the great declaration of the charter it have give those principle a strengthen vitality in the conduct of the affair of man

 today then at this time of anniversary let we not occupy ourselves with parochial doubt or with pass despair the united nations after 20 year do not draw its life from the assembly hail or the committee room it live in the conscience and the reason of mankind

 the most urgent problem we face be the keeping of the peace

 today as i speak clear and present danger in southeast asia cast their shadow across the path of all mankind

 the united nations must be concern

 the most elementary principle of the united nations be that neighbor must not attack their neighbor and that principle today be under challenge

 the process of peaceful settlement today be block by willful aggressor contemptuous of the opinion and the will of mankind bilateral diplomacy have yield no result

 the machinery of the geneva conference have be paralyze

 resort to the security council have be reject

 the effort of the distinguished secretary general have be rebuff

 an appeal for unconditional discussion be meet with contempt

 a pause in bombing operation be call an insult

 the concern for peace of the commonwealth prime ministers have receive little and very disappointing result

 therefore today i put to this world assembly the fact of aggression the right of a people to be free from attack the interest of every member in safety against molestation the duty of this organization to reduce the danger to peace and the unhesitate readiness of the united states of america to find a peaceful solution

 i now call upon this gathering of the nation of the world to use all their influence individually and collectively to bring to the table those who seem determined to make war we will support your effort as we will support effective action by any agent or agency of these united nations

 but the agenda of peace be not a single item

 around the world there be many dispute that be fill with dangers--

 --many tension that be taut with peril

 --many arm race that be fraught with folly among small nation as well as large and the first purpose of the united nations be peace keeping the first work of all member now then just must be peacemake for this organization exist to resolve quarrel outside the confine of its headquarter and not to prolong quarrel within

 where there be dispute let we try to find the mean to resolve they through whatever machinery be available or be possible

 where the united nations require readily available peace force in hour and day and not in week or month let all pledge to provide those force and my country be ready

 on another front of our common endeavor i think nothing be more urgent than the effort to diminish danger by bring the armament of the world under increase control nation rich and poor be burden down by excessive and competitive and frightening arm so let we all urgently commit ourselves to the rational reduction of those arm burden we of the united states would hope that other will join with we in come to our next negotiation with proposal for effective attack upon these deadly danger to mankind

 and after peace high on the agenda of man be devotion to the dignity and to the worth of the human person and the promotion of well standard of life in large freedom for all of the human race

 we in this country be commit ourselves to great task in our own great society we be commit to narrow the gap between promise and performance between equality in law and equality in fact between opportunity for the numerous well to do and the still too numerous poor between education for the successful and education for all of the people

 it be no long a community or a nation or a continent but a whole generation of mankind for whom our promise must be keep and keep within the next two decade

 if those promise be not keep it will be less and less possible to keep they for any

 and that be why on this anniversary i would call upon all member nation to rededicate themselves to wage together an international war on poverty

 so let we then together

 --raise the goal for technical aid and investment through the united nations

 --increase our food and health and education program to make a serious and a successful attack upon hunger and disease and ignorance the ancient enemy of all mankind

 let we in all our land include this land face forthrightly the multiplying problem of our multiplying population and seek the answer to this most profound challenge to the future of all the world let we act on the fact that less than $ 5 invest in population control be worth $ 100 invest in economic growth

 for our war together on the poverty and privation the hunger and sickness the despair and the futility of mankind let we mark this international cooperation year by join together in an alliance for man

 the promise of the future lie in what science the ever more productive industrial machine the ever more productive fertile and usable land the computer the miracle drug and the man in space all spread before we the promise of the future lie in what the religion and the philosophy the culture and the wisdom of 5,000 year of civilization have finally distil and confide to we the promise of the abundant life and the brotherhood of man

 the heritage that we share together be a fragile heritage

 a world war would certainly destroy it pride and arrogance could destroy it neglect and indifference could destroy it it could be destroy by narrow nationalism or ideological intolerance or rabid extremism of either the left or the right

 so we must find the way as a community of nation as a united nations to keep the peace among and between all of we we must restrain by joint and effective action any who place their ambition or their dogma or their prestige above the peace of all the world and we just must find a way to do that it be the most profound and the most urgent imperative of the time in which we live

 so i say to you as my personal belief and the belief i think of the great american majority that the world must finish once and for all the myth of inequality of race and people with the scandal of discrimination with the shocking violation of human right and the cynical violation of political right we must stop preach hatred we must stop bring up entire new generation to preserve and to carry out the lethal fantasy of the old generation stop believe that the gun or the bomb can solve all problem or that a revolution be of any value if it close door and limit choice instead of open both as wide as possible

 as far back as we can look until the light of history fade into the dusk of legend such aspiration of man have be submerge and swallow by the violence and the weakness of man at his bad

 generation have come and go and generation have try and fail

 will we succeed

 i do not know

 but i dare to be hopeful and confident

 and i do know this whether we look for the judgment to god or to history or to mankind this be the age and we be the man and this be the place to give reality to our commitment under the united nations charter for what be for other generation just a hope be for this generation a simple necessity

 thank you very much

 now i be prepared to take your question

 q. mr. president in your statement about the situation in viet nam sir you refer to the necessity for maintain adequate reserve and adequate equipment i wonder sir in view of the increase fighting and the increase manpower commitment be you give any thought be the government give any thought first to call up additional reserve or second to increase draft call

 the president the government be always consider every possibility and every eventuality no decision have be make in connection with the reserve or increase draft call we will be in a well position to act upon matter of that kind after the secretary return from his trip

 q. mr. president could you tell we whether governor harriman 's trip to moscow have any connection with the soviet position in viet nam

 the president i think that the governor have well explain that trip himself by say it be a vacation that be on the wire today it be not an official government trip he be not send there by the president although the governor be a man of a wide range of interest and experience i approve heartily of his statement that he would be glad to visit with any people that care to visit with he it be a personal trip and a vacation trip in nature

 q. mr. president what do you think in your judgment be the chance at this time of avoid a major land war in asia

 the president i do not think that anyone can prophesy what will happen from day to day or week to week or month to month i think it be well for we to remember that three president have make the pledge for this nation that the senate have ratify the seato treaty by a vote of 82 to i pledge the united states to come to the aid of any nation upon their request who be party to that treaty or protocol

 president eisenhower make our first commitment there in 1954 that be reaffirm by president kennedy many time in different way the present president have reiterate the stand of the united states that we expect to keep that commitment

 our national honor be at stake our word be at stake and it must be obvious to all americans that they would not want the president of their country to follow any course that be inconsistent with our commitment or with our national honor

 q. mr. president sir in view of the situation in north viet nam and south viet nam be you think of continue the plan for a merger of reserves and the national guard

 the president so far as i be aware the situation there have no effect on the merger one way or the other

 q. would it not affect the efficiency of our force

 the president it be contend that the merger would improve the efficiency but i do not think that it be a matter that would be consider in connection with what happen out there one way or the other

 q. mr. president could you give we a status report on the air force 's manned orbit laboratory and specifically whether you intend to give it a go ahead and if so when

 the president no i be not in a position to make a statement on that at this time the space council have have some briefing in connection with the matter there be a study go on every day in that connection but i would not want to go far than that now

 q. mr. president in view of the disarmament conference and the soviet response and ambassador harriman 's conversation with the soviet union could you give we your assessment of the soviet american relation as they stand now could you give we a temperature reading

 the president we be very anxious to maintain close relation with the soviet union and we have feel that considerable progress have be make in the last several year unfortunately the situation that develop in north viet nam have place a strain on those relation we regret it very deeply but we have feel that as i say early our national honor require we to pursue the course of conduct that we have follow

 we will be look for every opportunity that we can to work with the soviet union in the interest of peace we think that the resumption of the disarmament conference be one step in that direction we would like to improve the relation any way we can

 q. mr. president you tell we last week sir that thing in viet nam will probably get bad before they can get well and today you indicate that we will probably send a lot more force there than we have now can you give we any appraisal as to how many or be we go to change our fighting or be a new concept go to be introduce can you give we any indication of that

 the president as i say in my opening statement the aggression have increase the force that be pursue that aggression have greatly increase in number it will be necessary to resist that aggression and therefore to have substantially large increment of troop which we have be supply from time to time

 i do not think that anyone can tell at this date any special figure that will be require but i think that follow ambassador lodge and secretary mcnamara 's trip we will have a well estimate of what the rest of the year will hold for we

 q. mr. president some people have question the ability of the south vietnamese to govern themselves at this point most recently senator stennis of mississippi can you give we some indication of what you see in the future for the reestablishment of democratic civilian rule in saigon

 the president we would hope that if the north vietnamese would cease their aggression we could immediately take step to have the people of south viet nam exercise their choice and establish a government of their choosing we of course would hope that that would be a very efficient and effective and democratic system

 q. mr. president with the increase number of american troop go to viet nam would you say if there will be a continue or any increase diplomatic probing for a peaceful settlement

 the president yes we will constantly be on the alert to probe and to be ready and willing to negotiate with the appropriate people i must say that candor compel i to tell you that there have not be the slight indication that the other side be interested in negotiation or in unconditional discussion although the united states have make some dozen separate attempt to bring that about

 q. mr. president quite a bit have be write recently about your relation with the press some of these story have be openly critical to say the least sir we seem to have hear from everybody but you i wonder if you could give we your view on the subject

 the president i think that the press and the congress and the people of the united states have generally speak with very minor exception give i during the time i have be president very strong support and very excellent cooperation i know that there be some in each segment that have be disappoint in some of my decision and some of my action i like to think that those who talk about they the most see we the least and so far as i be concern i have no criticism to make of any other people in help i do my job

 we have a very fine cabinet nearly every person i have ask to come and help the government have do so i think that there be very few president in the history of this country that have have more support of more publisher and more magazine than the present president i be grateful for that although i recognize it be an essential part of their duty to point up weakness that they think exist

 i have see that take place for some 35 year and as long as they point they out in the manner in which they be point they out and the people continue to support we and the congress continue to support we i be not go to find any fault with they during the period that we have have the most hectic distress moment here in washington the poll have go up 6 percent out in the country so i sometimes think maybe it just may be july in the nation 's capital

 q. mr. president be you take any position at this point on the poll tax repealer in the house version of the voting right bill

 the president yes i have take a position since make my recommendation to the congress early in the year that i would like to see the poll tax repeal i be against the poll tax i have try to get it repeal every time that i have have a chance when i think we could do it legally

 i have ask the attorney general to attempt to work with the conferee of both house and senate to see if they can not agree on satisfactory language that will give we the most effective repeal provision that be obtainable and that we think can be support in the court i have no doubt but what a very satisfactory solution will be find and i think that would be quite desirable

 q. mr. president have you discuss with leonard marks as yet the particular man or the type of man that you and he might like to fill the other two key vacancy in the usia the deputy director and the head of the voice of america

 the president no the deputy director be now be handle by a very able man with experience who will be there for a while yet i be sure that after mr. marks review the organization and talk to the present deputy director and the present director mr. rowan he will come up with some suggestion and recommendation i believe that they will be acceptable

 q. mr. president in view of your long history of seek to keep civil right a bipartisan matter why do you single out the house republican leadership for criticism in your statement on voting right last week

 the president i do not single out anyone we have have several day debate about the relative merit of two proposal it have be observe that the administration proposal be dripping in venom and be inadequate and go too far and a good many thing have be say about it finally when it be put as a test to the judgment of the house and they make their decision i commend that decision and say that i believe that they be wise in act as they have because have they adopt the so call ford or mcculloch substitute for the committee bill as advocate by judge howard smith and governor tuck and other i be of the opinion it would have dilute and take strength from the bill that they have pass

 i be very proud of the action of the house i be very proud of the judgment they exercise in that connection but people be allow to comment on the relative merit of legislation either before or after a vote and i find there have be a good many comment on my proposal i think it would be appropriate if i carefully limit myself to an observation that the substitute would have dilute the right of every american to vote

 i think all of we be aware of the fact that in year go by we could have do much more than we have in that field i have become very conscious of that as i have travel over this nation and talk to our people i think the house act wisely and i have every confidence in the action that will follow the conference report i ask the cooperation of member of both party i do not think the substitute be as effective as the bill that be adopt and i would not like to see we return to it

 q. mr. president in connection with civil right and the colloquy between you and the republican leader they have suggest that over the year you have change your position on civil right i wonder if you could give we your concept of your develop philosophy on civil right legislation

 the president yes i think that all of we realize at this stage of the 20th century there be much that should have be do that have not be do this bill be not go to solve the problem completely itself there will be much to be do in the year ahead i think the problem of the american negro be one of the two or three most important problem that we must face up to with our legislation again next year

 i be particularly sensitive to the problem of the negro and the problem of the city and the problem which the shift in population have cause the problem of education i have task force work on those thing and perhaps it be because i realize after travel through 44 state and after read some 20,000 or 30,000 letter a week digest from they that it be a very acute problem and one that i want to do my good to solve in the .limited time that i be allow

 i do not have that responsibility in the year past and i do not feel it to the extent that i do today i hope that you may understand that i think it be an acute one and a dangerous one and one that occupy high priority and one that should challenge every american of whatever party whatever religion i be go to try to provide all the leadership that i can notwithstanding the fact that someone may point to a mistake or 100 mistake that i make in my past

 q. mr. president the soviet union announce yesterday a new aid agreement to north viet nam i think they say it be over and beyond what they be now supply do you see this as a serious perhaps dangerous contribution to the increase aggression you speak of early that be be direct from the north

 the president peter i do not think that we can tell the extent of that agreement and how far it will reach they give no figure they do not explain what material they be go to supply we have know for some time now that they be furnish equipment and they be furnish supply and they be make contribution of aid in one form or the other to north viet nam this be no surprise to we at all

 i read the very general announcement that they have make there be nothing that i could detect from it or that our expert could detect that would give i any more information than contain in the announcement

 q. mr. president do you think it possible that increase aggression and infiltration by north viet nam spring from a misreading on the other side a perhaps mistaken belief that the teach in and whatever criticism there have be here in the united states of your policy that this represent the voice of the american people

 the president no i do not think that the teach in and the difference of opinion have increase the strength of the north vietnamese or the aggression that have take place i do think that at time our ally particularly the south vietnamese people and particularly our own soldier do get concerned about how strong we be behind they and how united we be in this very serious undertaking

 but i be glad to say that i do not think it have have any serious or damaging effect there i get several letter a day from soldier in viet nam service people the navy marines army and air i hear from their parent and i have yet to receive a single complain letter

 on occasion they wish that the folk back home who be follow this with such dedicated interest understand the position as they feel they understand it but i do not think it have damage our effort out there and i do not think it will i think we will be unite in this effort

 there will be some difference of opinion about the wisdom of some course that the president take the executive take but whenever and wherever we can we will try to explain those to the people involve and at least try to get their understanding

 q. mr. president there have be report publish from time to time that you might contemplate a change in the office of the secretary of state in the month to come do you foresee such a change

 the president none whatever and i think you do a great damage and a great disservice to one of the most able and most competent and most dedicated man that i have ever know secretary rusk he sit to my right in the cabinet room he rank first in the cabinet and he rank first with i

 q. mr. president there be two recently publish version as to how president kennedy select you as his vice presidential running mate in 1960 mr. graham 's and mr. schlesinger 's which of these in your judgment be close to the truth or do you have your own version

 the president i would not want to get into a dispute with my friend who have write these memorandum i do not see anything to be gain by that

 the president ask i on his own motion to go on the ticket with he and i give he my reason for hesitate he tell i he would speak to speaker rayburn and other and he do subsequently he call i and say here be a statement i be go to read on television unless you have an objection i listen to it after i hear it i feel that i should do what i do i do not know just how much these man may know about what actually happen but they be entitle to their opinion of course i know why i do what i do

 thank you mr. president





the president my fellow americans

 not long ago i receive a letter from a woman in the midwest she write

 dear mr. president

 in my humble way i be write to you about the crisis in viet nam i have a son who be now in viet nam my husband serve in world war ii our country be at war but now this time it be just something that i do not understand why

 well i have try to answer that question dozen of time and more in practically every state in this union i have discuss it fully in baltimore in april in washington in may in san francisco in june let i again now discuss it here in the east room of the white house

 why must young americans bear into a land exultant with hope and with golden promise toil and suffer and sometimes die in such a remote and distant place

 the answer like the war itself be not an easy one but it echo clearly from the painful lesson of half a century three time in my lifetime in two world wars and in korea americans have go to far land to fight for freedom we have learn at a terrible and a brutal cost that retreat do not bring safety and weakness do not bring peace

 it be this lesson that have bring we to viet nam this be a different kind of war there be no march army or solemn declaration some citizen of south viet nam at time with understandable grievance have join in the attack on their own government

 but we must not let this mask the central fact that this be really war it be guide by north viet nam and it be spur by communist china its goal be to conquer the south to defeat american power and to extend the asiatic dominion of communism there be great stake in the balance most of the non communist nation of asia can not by themselves and alone resist the grow might and the grasp ambition of asian communism

 our power therefore be a very vital shield if we be drive from the field in viet nam then no nation can ever again have the same confidence in american promise or in american protection

 in each land the force of independence would be considerably weaken and an asia so threaten by communist domination would certainly imperil the security of the united states itself

 we do not choose to be the guardian at the gate but there be no one else

 nor would surrender in viet nam bring peace because we learn from hitler at munich that success only feed the appetite of aggression the battle would be renew in one country and then another country bring with it perhaps even large and crueler conflict as we have learn from the lesson of history

 moreover we be in viet nam to fulfill one of the most solemn pledge of the american nation three president president eisenhower president kennedy and your present president over 11 year have commit themselves and have promise to help defend this small and valiant nation

 strengthen by that promise the people of south viet nam have fight for many long year thousand of they have die thousand more have be crippled and scar by war we just can not now dishonor our word or abandon our commitment or leave those who believe we and who trust we to the terror and repression and murder that would follow

 this then my fellow americans be why we be in viet nam

 my fellow americans

 once again in man 's age old struggle for a well life and a world of peace the wisdom courage and compassion of the american people be be put to the test this be the meaning of the tragic conflict in vietnam

 in meet the present challenge it be essential that our people seek understanding and that our leader speak with candor

 i have therefore direct that this report to the american people be compile and widely distribute in its page you will find statement on vietnam by three leader of your government by your president your secretary of state and your secretary of defense

 these statement be prepare for different audience and they reflect the differ responsibility of each speaker the congressional testimony have be edit to avoid undue repetition and to incorporate the sense of the discussion that ensue

 together they construct a clear definition of america 's role in the vietnam conflict

 --the danger and hope that vietnam hold for all free man

 --the fullness and limit of our national objective in a war we do not seek

 --the constant effort on our part to bring this war we do not desire to a quick and honorable end

 what be our goal in that war strain land

 first we intend to convince the communists that we can not be defeat by force of arm or by superior power they be not easily convince in recent month they have greatly increase their fighting force and their attack and the number of incident

 i have ask the commanding general general westmoreland what more he need to meet this mount aggression he have tell i we will meet his need

 i have today order to viet nam the air mobile division and certain other force which will raise our fighting strength from 75,000 to 125,000 man almost immediately additional force will be need later and they will be send as request

 this will make it necessary to increase our active fighting force by raise the monthly draft call from 17,000 over a period of time to 35,000 per month and for we to step up our campaign for voluntary enlistment

 after this past week of deliberation i have conclude that it be not essential to order reserve unit into service now if that necessity should later be indicate i will give the matter most careful consideration and i will give the country you an adequate notice before take such action but only after full preparation

 we have also discuss with the government of south viet nam lately the step that we will take to substantially increase their own effort both on the battlefield and toward reform and progress in the village ambassador lodge be now formulate a new program to be test upon his return to that area

 i have direct secretary rusk and secretary mcnamara to be available immediately to the congress to review with these committee the appropriate congressional committee what we plan to do in these area i have ask they to be able to answer the question of any member of congress

 secretary mcnamara in addition will ask the senate appropriations committee to add a limited amount to present legislation to help meet part of this new cost until a supplemental measure be ready and hearing can be hold when the congress assemble in january in the meantime we will use the authority contain in the present defense appropriation bill under consideration to transfer fund in addition to the additional money that we will ask

 these step like our action in the past be carefully measure to do what must be do to bring an end to aggression and a peaceful settlement

 we do not want an expand struggle with consequence that no one can perceive nor will we bluster or bully or flaunt our power but we will not surrender and we will not retreat

 for behind our american pledge lie the determination and resource i believe of all of the american nation

 second once the communists know as we know that a violent solution be impossible then a peaceful solution be inevitable

 we be ready now as we have always be to move from the battlefield to the conference table i have state publicly and many time again and again america 's willingness to begin unconditional discussion with any government at any place at any time fifteen effort have be make to start these discussion with the help of 40 nation throughout the world but there have be no answer

 but we be go to continue to persist if persist we must until death and desolation have lead to the same conference table where other could now join we at a much small cost

 i have speak many time of our objective in viet nam so have the government of south viet nam hanoi have set forth its own proposal we be ready to discuss their proposal and our proposal and any proposal of any government whose people may be affect for we fear the meeting room no more than we fear the battlefield

 in this pursuit we welcome and we ask for the concern and the assistance of any nation and all nation if the united nations and its official or any one of its 114 member can by deed or word private initiative or public action bring we nearer an honorable peace then they will have the support and the gratitude of the united states of america

 i have direct ambassador goldberg to go to new york today and to present immediately to secretary general u thant a letter from i request that all the resource energy and immense prestige of the united nations be employ to find way to halt aggression and to bring peace in viet nam

 i make a similar request at san francisco a few week ago because we do not seek the destruction of any government nor do we covet a foot of any territory but we insist and we will always insist that the people of south viet nam shall have the right of choice the right to shape their own destiny in free election in the south or throughout all viet nam under international supervision and they shall not have any government impose upon they by force and terror so long as we can prevent it

 this be the purpose of the 1954 agreement which the communists have now cruelly shatter if the machinery of those agreement be tragically weak its purpose still guide our action as battle rage we will continue as good we can to help the good people of south viet nam enrich the condition of their life to feed the hungry and to tend the sick and teach the young and shelter the homeless and to help the farmer to increase his crop and the worker to find a job

 it be an ancient but still terrible irony that while many leader of man create division in pursuit of grand ambition the child of man be really unite in the simple elusive desire for a life of fruitful and rewarding toil

 as i say at johns hopkins in baltimore i hope that one day we can help all the people of asia toward that desire eugene black have make great progress since my appearance in baltimore in that direction not as the price of peace for we be ready always to bear a more painful cost but rather as a part of our obligation of justice toward our fellow man

 let i also add now a personal note i do not find it easy to send the flower of our youth our fine young man into battle i have speak to you today of the division and the force and the battalion and the unit but i know they all every one i have see they in a thousand street of a hundred town in every state in this union work and laughing and building and fill with hope and life i think i know too how their mother weep and how their family sorrow

 this be the most agonizing and the most painful duty of your president

 there be something else too when i be young poverty be so common that we do not know it have a name an education be something that you have to fight for and water be really life itself i have now be in public life 35 year more than three decade and in each of those 35 year i have see good man and wise leader struggle to bring the blessing of this land to all of our people

 and now i be the president it be now my opportunity to help every child get an education to help every negro and every american citizen have an equal opportunity to have every family get a decent home and to help bring healing to the sick and dignity to the old

 as i have say before that be what i have live for that be what i have want all my life since i be a little boy and i do not want to see all those hope and all those dream of so many people for so many year now drown in the wasteful ravage of cruel war i be go to do all i can do to see that that never happen

 but i also know as a realistic public servant that as long as there be man who hate and destroy we must have the courage to resist or we will see it all all that we have build all that we hope to build all of our dream for freedom all all will be sweep away on the flood of conquest

 so too this shall not happen we will stand in viet nam

 now what america be and be and hope to stand for as an important national asset tell the truth to this world tell an exciting story be the voice of america i classify this assignment in the front rank of importance to the freedom of the world and that be why today i be proud to announce to you the name of the man who will direct the voice of america

 he be a man whose voice and whose face and whose mind be know to this country and to most of the entire world his name be john chancellor

 mr. chancellor be bear 38 year ago in chicago for more than 15 year he have be with the news department of the national broadcasting company during that time he have cover the world in vienna london moscow new york brussels berlin and washington

 since 1964 he have be with you one of the white house correspondent

 this i think be the first time in the history of the voice of america that a work newspaperman a respected commentator an experienced independent reporter have be give the responsibility of leadership and direction in this vital enterprise i think he understand the challenge that be present and the achievement that be possible

 i be satisfied that the voice of america will be in imaginative competent reliable and always truthful hand

 stand up john will you please

 the president have few responsibility of great importance or great consequence to the country 's future than the constitutional responsibility of nominate justices for the supreme court of the united states

 i be happy today here in the east room to announce that the distinguished american who be my first choice for the position now vacant on the supreme court have agree to accept this call to this vital duty i will very shortly this afternoon send to the united states senate my nomination of the honorable abe fortas to be an associate justice of the supreme court

 for many many year i have regard mr. fortas as one of this nation 's most able and most respected and most outstanding citizen a scholar a profound thinker a lawyer of superior ability and a man of humane and deeply compassionate feeling toward his fellow man a champion of our liberty that opinion be share by the legal profession and by the bar of this country by member of the congress and by the leader of business and labor and other sector of our national life

 mr. fortas have as you know tell i on numerous occasion in the last 20 month that he would not be an applicant or a candidate or would not accept any appointment to any public office this be i guess as it should be for in this instance the job have seek the man mr. fortas agree that the duty and the opportunity of service on the high court of this great country be not a call that any citizen can reject

 so i be proud for the country that he have this morning accept this appointment and will serve his country as an associate justice of the supreme court

 i will be glad to take your question now for a period

 q. mr. president in the light of the decision on viet nam which you have just announce be the united states prepare with additional plan should north viet nam escalate its military effort and how do you anticipate that the chinese communists will react to what you have announce today

 the president i do not want to speculate on the reaction of other people this nation be prepare and will always be prepare to protect its national interest

 q. mr. president you have never talk about a timetable in connection with viet nam you have say and you repeat today that the united states will not be defeat will not grow tired

 donald johnson national commander of the american legion go over to viet nam in the spring and later call on you he tell white house reporter that he could imagine the war over there go on for 5 6 or 7 year have you think of that possibility sir and do you think the american people ought to think of that possibility

 the president yes i think the american people ought to understand that there be no quick solution to the problem that we face there i would not want to prophesy or predict whether it would be a matter of month or year or decade i do not know that we have any accurate timetable on how long it would take to bring victory in world war i. i do not think anyone really know whether it would be 2 year or 4 year or 6 year to meet with success in world war ii i do think our cause be just i do think our purpose and objective be beyond any question

 i do believe that america will stand united behind her man that be there i plan as long as i be president to see that our force be strong enough to protect our national interest our right hand constantly protect that interest with our military and that our diplomatic and political negotiation be constantly attempt to find some solution that would substitute word for bomb

 as i have say so many time if anyone question our good faith and will ask we to meet they to try to reason this matter out they will find we at the appoint place at the appoint time in the proper chair

 q. mr. president there be now a representative of the government of ghana in hanoi talk with the foreign minister of north viet nam about the war in viet nam do you see any indication of hope that something good will come of these talk

 the president we be always hopeful that every effort in that direction will meet with success we welcome those effort as we welcome the commonwealth proposal as we welcome mr. davies visit as we welcome the indian suggestion as we have welcome the effort of the distinguished prime minister of great britain and other from time to time

 as i just say i hope that every member of the united nations that have any idea any plan any program any suggestion that they will not let they go unexplored

 q. mr. president from what you have outline as your program for now it would seem that you feel that we can have gun and butter for the foreseeable future do you have any idea right now though that down the road a piece the american people may have to face the problem of gun or butter

 the president i have not the slight doubt but whatever it be necessary to face the american people will face i think that all of we know that we be now in the 5 ad month of the prosperity that have be unequale in this nation and i see no reason for declare a national emergency and i reject that course of action early today when i make my decision

 i can not foresee what next year or the follow year or the follow year will hold i only know that the americans will do whatever be necessary at the moment we enjoy the good fortune of have an unparalleled period of prosperity with we and this government be go to do all it can to see it continue

 q. mr. president can you tell we whether the missile site in north viet nam that be bomb yesterday be man by russians and whether or not the administration have a policy about russian technician in north viet nam

 the president no we have no information as to how they be man we can not speak with any authority on that matter we make the decision that we feel our national interest require and as those problem present themselves we will face up to they

 q. mr. president i wonder if you have have any communication from chiang kai shek that he be ready to go to war with you

 the president we have communicate with most of the friendly nation of the world in the last few day and we have receive from they response that have be encouraging i would not want to go into any individual response here but i would say that i have indicate to all of the friendly nation what our problem be there the decision that confront we and ask for their help and for their suggestion

 q. mr. president give the russian military involvement or apparent involvement on the side of hanoi on the one side and the dialog which mr. harriman have be conduct for you on the other as well as the disarmament talk in geneva at the moment could you tell we whether you believe this war as you now call it can be contain in this corner of southeast asia without involve a u.s.-soviet confrontation

 the president we would hope very much that it could and we will do nothing to provoke that confrontation if we can avoid it as you know immediately after i assume the presidency i immediately send message to the soviet union we have have frequent exchange of view by letter and by conversation with mr. gromyko and mr. dobrynin we be do nothing to provoke the soviet union we be very happy that they agree to resume the disarmament conference

 i go to some length to try to extend ourselves to make the proposal that i would hope would meet with acceptance of the people of the world we would like to believe that there could be some success flow from this conference although we have not be too successful

 i know of nothing that we have in mind that should arouse the distrust or provoke any violence on the part of the soviet union

 q. mr. president do the fact that you be send additional force to viet nam imply any change in the exist policy of rely mainly on the south vietnamese to carry out offensive operation and use american force to guard american installation and to act as an emergency backup

 the president it do not imply any change in policy whatever it do not imply any change of objective

 q. mr. president would you like to see the united nations now move formally as an organization to attempt to achieve a settlement in viet nam

 the president i have make very clear in my san francisco speech my hope that the secretary general under his wise leadership would explore every possibility that might lead to a solution of this matter in my letter to the secretary general this morning which ambassador goldberg will deliver later in the day i reiterate my hope and my desire and i urge upon he that he if he agree that he undertake new effort in this direction

 ambassador goldberg understand the challenge we spend the weekend talk about the potentiality and the possibility our hope and our dream and i believe that we will have an able advocate and a search negotiator who i would hope would some day find success

 q. mr. president what be the border of your power to conduct a war at what point might you have to ask congress for a declaration

 the president i do not know that would depend on the circumstance i can not pinpoint the date on the calendar or the hour of the day i have to ask congress for their judgment and for their decision almost every hour of the day

 one of the principal duty of the office of president be to maintain constant consultation i have talk to i guess more than 50 member of congress in the last 24 hour i have submit myself to their question and the secretary of state and the secretary of defense will meet with they tomorrow if they be ready to answer any question that they may need

 up to now we have have ample authority excellent cooperation a united congress behind we and as near as i could tell from my meeting last night with the leader and from my meeting today with the distinguished chairman of the committee and the member of both party we all meet as americans unite and determine to stand as one

 q. mr. president in this connection however last night one of the lead governor of the republicans say some rather strong thing governor hatfield of oregon say the most recent escalation of action in viet nam be move all the people of the world close to world war iii and we have no moral right to commit the world and especially our own people to world war iii unilaterally or by the decision of a few expert

 this seem to imply rather strong criticism of present policy do you care to express any reaction

 the president yes i do not interpret it that way i think that there be danger in escalation i do not think i have any right to commit the whole world to world war iii i be do everything i know how to avoid it but retreat be not necessarily the good way to avoid it

 i have outline to you what i think be the good policy i would hope that governor hatfield and the other governors when they understand what we be do and when i have a chance to submit myself to their questioning and to counsel with they would share my view

 i know they have the same concern for the american people and the people of the world as i do i do not believe our objective will be very different

 as a matter of fact i ask the governors if they could to come here at the conclusion of their deliberation i will have my plane go to minneapolis tomorrow and i believe 43 of the 48 have indicate a desire to come here

 i will give they all the information i can confidential secret and otherwise because i have great respect for they their judgment their opinion and their leadership it be go to be necessary in this effort

 i will also have the secretary of state and secretary of defense review with they all their plan and answer any of their inquiry and we hope resolve any doubt they might have

 q. mr. president after the week of deliberation on viet nam how do you feel in the context of your office we always hear it be the loneliest in the world

 the president nancy i be sorry but because of the camera and microphone i do not get your question raise the microphone up where i can hear and you camera boy give she a chance

 q. mr. president i say after the week of deliberation on viet nam how do you feel personally particularly in the context we always hear that your office be the loneliest in the world

 the president well i do not agree with that i do not guess there be anyone in this country that have as much understanding and as much help and as many expert and as good advice and many people of both party try to help they as they be i of course i admit i need it more than anybody else

 nancy i have not be lonely the last few day i have have lot of caller

 q. mr. president would you be willing to permit direct negotiation with the viet cong force that be in south viet nam

 the president we have state time and time again that we would negotiate with any government any place any time the viet cong would have no difficulty in be represent and have their view present if hanoi for a moment decide she want to cease aggression and i would not think that would be an insurmountable problem at all i think that could be work out

 q. mr. president to shift the subject just a moment do your appointment of mr. gardner14 suggest that there will be less interest now in the creation of a separate department of education

 the president no not at all my appointment of mr. gardner suggest that i look over america to find the very good man i could to lead we forward to become an educate nation where every child obtain all the education that he can take and where the health of every citizen be his prime concern and where the social security system be bring to the need of the 20th century

 after canvass some 40 or 50 possibility i conclude that mr. gardner be the good man i could get i ask his board to relieve he of his duty and release he to the government so that he could furnish the dynamic leadership officially that he have be furnish unofficially to we

 he tell i yesterday morning that he be prepared to do that i remember that i have not ask he what state he live in where his permanent residence be so i could put it on the nomination paper or what party he belong to and he rather well maybe somewhat hesitantly say i be a republican

 i do not mean that his hesitating mean any particular significance but i be happy that he say that because a good many republicans vote for i and i do not want to be partial or partisan in this administration i like to see leadership of that kind come from the republican rank so i tell he if he have no objection i would announce very promptly his appointment and i hope that he would give we american leadership without regard to party and that be what i think he will do i believe all the nation will be proud of he as we be of secretary celebrezze

 thank you mr. president





mr. vice president mr. speaker members of congress member of the cabinet distinguished guest my fellow americans

 today be a triumph for freedom as huge as any victory that have ever be win on any battlefield yet to seize the meaning of this day we must recall dark time

 three and a half century ago the first negroes arrive at jamestown they do not arrive in brave ship in search of a home for freedom they do not mingle fear and joy in expectation that in this new world anything would be possible to a man strong enough to reach for it

 they come in darkness and they come in chain

 and today we strike away the last major shackle of those fierce and ancient bond today the negro story and the american story fuse and blend

 and let we remember that it be not always so the story of our nation and of the american negro be like two great river well up from that tiny jamestown spring they flow through the century along divided channel

 when pioneer subdue a continent to the need of man they do not tame it for the negro when the liberty bell ring out in philadelphia it do not toll for the negro when andrew jackson throw open the door of democracy they do not open for the negro

 it be only at appomattox a century ago that an american victory be also a negro victory and the two river one shine with promise the other dark stain with oppression begin to move toward one another

 yet for almost a century the promise of that day be not fulfil today be a towering and certain mark that in this generation that promise will be keep in our time the two current will finally mingle and rush as one great stream across the uncertain and the marvelous year of the america that be yet to come

 this act flow from a clear and simple wrong its only purpose be to right that wrong million of americans be deny the right to vote because of their color this law will ensure they the right to vote the wrong be one which no american in his heart can justify the right be one which no american true to our principle can deny

 in 1957 as the leader of the majority in the united states senate speak in support of legislation to guarantee the right of all man to vote i say this right to vote be the basic right without which all other be meaningless it give people people as individual control over their own destiny

 last year i say until every qualified person regardless of the color of his skin have the right unquestione and unrestrained to go in and cast his ballot in every precinct in this great land of ours i be not go to be satisfied

 immediately after the election i direct the attorney general to explore as rapidly as possible the way to ensure the right to vote

 and then last march with the outrage of selma still fresh i come down to this capitol one evening and ask the congress and the people for swift and for sweep action to guarantee to every man and woman the right to vote in less than 48 hour i send the voting rights act of 1965 to the congress in little more than 4 month the congress with overwhelming majority enact one of the most monumental law in the entire history of american freedom

 the members of the congress and the many private citizen who work to shape and pass this bill will share a place of honor in our history for this one act alone

 there be those who say this be an old injustice and there be no need to hurry but 95 year have pass since the 15th amendment give all negroes the right to vote

 and the time for wait be go

 there be those who say small and more gradual measure should be try but they have be try for year and year they have be try and try and try and they have fail and fail and fail

 and the time for failure be go

 there be those who say that this be a many sided and very complex problem but however view the denial of the right to vote be still a deadly wrong

 and the time for injustice have go

 this law cover many page but the heart of the act be plain wherever by clear and objective standard state and county be use regulation or law or test to deny the right to vote then they will be strike down if it be clear that state official still intend to discriminate then federal examiner will be send in to register all eligible voter when the prospect of discrimination be go the examiner will be immediately withdraw

 and under this act if any county anywhere in this nation do not want federal intervention it need only open its polling place to all of its people

 this good congress the 89th congress act swiftly in pass this act i intend to act with equal dispatch in enforce this act

 and tomorrow at 1 p.m. the attorney general have be direct to file a lawsuit challenge the constitutionality of the poll tax in the state of mississippi this will begin the legal process which i confidently believe will very soon prohibit any state from require the payment of money in order to exercise the fight to vote

 and also by tomorrow the justice department through publication in the federal register will have officially certify the states where discrimination exist

 i have in addition request the department of justice to work all through this weekend so that on monday morning next they can designate many county where past experience clearly show that federal action be necessary and require and by tuesday morning train federal examiner will be at work register eligible man and woman in 10 to 15 county

 and on that same day next tuesday additional poll tax suit will be file in the states of texas alabama and virginia

 and i pledge you that we will not delay or we will not hesitate or we will not turn aside until americans of every race and color and origin in this country have the same right as all other to share in the process of democracy

 so through this act and its enforcement an important instrument of freedom pass into the hand of million of our citizen but that instrument must be use president and congresses law and lawsuit can open the door to the polling place and open the door to the wondrous reward which await the wise use of the ballot

 but only the individual negro and all other who have be deny the right to vote can really walk through those door and can use that right and can transform the vote into an instrument of justice and fulfillment

 so let i now say to every negro in this country you must register you must vote you must learn so your choice advance your interest and the interest of our beloved nation your future and your child 's future depend upon it and i do not believe that you be go to let they down

 this act be not only a victory for negro leadership this act be a great challenge to that leadership it be a challenge which can not be meet simply by protest and demonstration it mean that dedicated leader must work around the clock to teach people their right and their responsibility and to lead they to exercise those right and to fulfill those responsibility and those duty to their country

 if you do this then you will find as other have find before you that the vote be the most powerful instrument ever devise by man for break down injustice and destroy the terrible wall which imprison man because they be different from other man

 today what be perhaps the last of the legal barrier be tumble there will be many action and many difficulty before the right weave into law be also weave into the fabric of our nation but the struggle for equality must now move toward a different battlefield

 it be nothing less than grant every american negro his freedom to enter the mainstream of american life not the conformity that blur enrich difference of culture and tradition but rather the opportunity that give each a chance to choose

 for century of oppression and hatred have already take their painful toll it can be see throughout our land in man without skill in child without father in family that be imprison in slum and in poverty

 for it be not enough just to give man right they must be able to use those right in their personal pursuit of happiness the wound and the weakness the outward wall and the inward scar which diminish achievement be the work of american society we must all now help to end they help to end they through expand program already devise and through new one to search out and forever end the special handicap of those who be black in a nation that happen to be mostly white

 so it be for this purpose to fulfill the right that we now secure that i have already call a white house conference to meet here in the nation 's capital this fall

 so we will move step by step often painfully but i think with clear vision along the path toward american freedom

 it be difficult to fight for freedom but i also know how difficult it can be to bend long year of habit and custom to grant it there be no room for injustice anywhere in the american mansion but there be always room for understanding toward those who see the old way crumble and to they today i say simply this it must come it be right that it should come and when it have you will find that a burden have be lift from your shoulder too

 it be not just a question of guilt although there be that it be that man can not live with a lie and not be stain by it

 the central fact of american civilization one so hard for other to understand be that freedom and justice and the dignity of man be not just word to we we believe in they under all the growth and the tumult and abundance we believe and so as long as some among we be oppress and we be part of that oppression it must blunt our faith and sap the strength of our high purpose

 thus this be a victory for the freedom of the american negro but it be also a victory for the freedom of the american nation and every family across this great entire search land will live strong in liberty will live more splendid in expectation and will be prouder to be american because of the act that you have pass that i will sign today

 thank you

the president good morning lady and gentleman

 after discussion with vice president humphrey and member of the space council as well as defense secretary mcnamara i be today instruct the department of defense to immediately proceed with the development of a manned orbit laboratory

 this program will bring we new knowledge about what man be able to do in space it will enable we to relate that ability to the defense of america

 it will develop technology and equipment which will help advance manned and unmanned space flight

 it will make it possible to perform very new and rewarding experiment with that technology and equipment

 the cost of develop the manned orbit laboratory will be $ 1.5 billion

 unmanned flight to test launching recovery and other basic part of the system will begin late next year or early 1967 the initial unmanned launch of a fully equip laboratory be schedule for 1968 this will be follow later that year by the first of five flight with two man crew

 the air force have select the douglas aircraft company to design and to build the spacecraft in which the crew of the laboratory will live and operate the general electric company will plan and develop the space experiment the titan iii c booster will launch the laboratory into space and a modify version of the nasa gemini capsule will be the vehicle in which the astronaut return to earth

 even as we meet gemini 5 pilot by two very gallant man back by hundred of dedicated space scientist and engineer and great administrator now orbit the earth as a dramatic reminder that our american dream for outer space be a dream of peace and a dream of friendly cooperation among all the nation of the earth

 we believe the heavens belong to the people of every country we be work and we will continue to work through the united nations our distinguished ambassador mr. goldberg be present with we this morning to extend the rule of law into outer space

 we intend to live up to our agreement not to orbit weapon of mass destruction and we will continue to hold out to all nation include the soviet union the hand of cooperation in the exciting year of space exploration which lie ahead for all of we therefore i have today in fact direct mr. james webb the administrator of our civilian space program after confer with the secretary of state and our ambassador to the united nations and other to invite the soviet academy of science to send a very high level representative here next month to observe the launching of gemini 6

 i hope that he will find it convenient to come we will certainly give he a warm welcome in america

 this morning i have just conclude a breakfast meeting with the cabinet and with the head of federal agency

 i be ask each of they to immediately begin to introduce a very new and a very revolutionary system of planning and program and budget throughout the vast federal government so that through the tool of modern management the full promise of a fine life can be bring to every american at the low possible cost

 under this new system each cabinet and agency head will set up a very special staff of expert who use the most modern method of program analysis will define the goal of their department for the coming year once these goal be establish this system will permit we to find the most effective and the least costly alternative to achieve american goal

 this program be design to achieve three major objective

 it will help we find new way to do job fast to do job well and to do job less expensively

 it will insure a much sounder judgment through more accurate information pinpoint those thing that we ought to do more spotlight those thing that we ought to do less

 it will make our decision make process as up to date i think as our space explore program

 everything that i have do in both legislation and the construction of a budget have always be guide by my own very deep concern for the american people consistent with wise management of course of the taxpayer 's dollar

 so this new system will identify our national goal with precision and will do it on a continue basis it will enable we to fulfill the need of all the american people with a minimum amount of waste

 and because we will be able to make sounder decision than ever before i think the people of this nation will receive great benefit from every tax dollar that be spend in their behalf

 on july the 20th i name as united states ambassador to the united nations a man to whom the sacred cause of peace be an obsession justice arthur goldberg

 so i be happy this morning to reinforce the united states team at the united nations with four americans who also share a passion for peace

 --as representative to the security council with the rank of ambassador i be name the noted president of howard university dr. james nabrit jr.

 --as representative to the trusteeship council of the united nations also with the rank of ambassador a vibrant attractive american woman who have already serve as the nation 's chief diplomat in both denmark and bulgaria mrs. eugenie anderson of minnesota

 tomorrow i will sign into law one of the most important hi]is enact by congress this session the public works and economic development act of 1965 to direct this far reach program of promise for the distressed area all across america i intend to nominate as assistant secretary of commerce and as director of economic development one of our most brilliant young public servant the outstanding administrator of the small business administration mr. eugene p. foley please stand mr. foley

 i be also pleased to announce this morning the appointment of mr. hobart taylor jr. as a member of the board of directors of the export import bank mr. taylor have be associate special counsel to the president since may 1964 he be previously executive vice chairman of the president 's committee on equal employment opportunity and have largely direct our effort with the large corporation and institution of this country in our plan for progress will you please stand mr. taylor

 he will be succeed as my associate special counsel by another talented young lawyer who hold degree from both harvard and yale and now serve as deputy special assistant to the president mr. clifford alexander jr. mr. alexander have recently reach the tired old age of 32 will you please stand mr. alexander

 it be also a pleasure to announce the nomination this morning of the new united states attorney for the district of columbia it may interest some of you people who live here in the district of columbia mr. david g. bress mr. bress have not only carry on a very vigorous private practice and civic life but he have teach in the field of law at american university at georgetown law center the university of virginia law school and have be head of the bar association of the district of columbia will you stand mr. bress

 fifty year ago president woodrow wilson ask just what be it that america stand for if she stand for one thing more than another it be for the sovereignty of self govern people

 so i be very proud of the progress that we be make toward that principle on one front and i be disappoint at the lack of progress that we be make on another

 the attorney general and the chairman of the civil service commission have just report to i what i think be a truly remarkable story in the 19 day since i sign into law the voting rights act of 1965 which i recommend to congress and they promptly enact already a total of 27,385 negro in 13 county in 3 southern states have qualify to vote and they represent nearly one third of the potential applicant in all those 13 county

 only this morning a team of federal examiner will begin to list voter in the 14th county that have be designate by the attorney general that new office will be open in the town of prentiss in jefferson davis county mississippi

 i be equally encourage by the high level of acceptance and i be very pleased with the compliance that we have have in score of other southern county throughout the country

 --a check of 45 county in georgia show already that 99 percent of 2,000 negro applicant have be register without any difficulty

 --in 50 louisiana county not a single negro have be reject

 --in mississippi nearly 12,000 negroes have be register by local registrar over and above those that we mention that be register by federal examiner the number of negro citizen register in mississippi have increase 100 percent in the last 6 week

 obedience be always preferable to enforcement where enforcement be necessary we will not hesitate to meet our responsibility under the law but the very clear and the very heartening lesson of this wonderful report be that obedience to the law be a fact of life to so many man and woman of good will throughout the south

 on another front here in our lovely nation 's capital city--"the sovereignty of self govern people be still unresolved

 the people of the district of columbia i think deserve and i think must and will have home rule it be an irony and disgrace that having extend self government already to the philippine islands and to puerto rico having enthusiastically recommend democratic principle to nation around the world nation after nation after having welcome alaska and hawaii as new states that somehow some people seem to be afraid to trust almost a million american citizen with the management of their own affair here in the district of columbia

 congress be move to redeem this disgrace the senate as on at least five different occasion in the past have act to pass a good home rule bill contain a solid and a workable charter for home rule

 that bill should come before the house of representatives very shortly the limit of reasonable delay have long since be reach and pass

 no one doubt the outcome once that bill finally get to the floor of the house and the members be permit to vote on it but what be need this morning be a commitment by the leadership and by the member of both party if you please to the only practical mean of get the bill on the floor and that seem to be the petition to discharge the house district committee from further delay of the bill

 bills have be pende before that committee for year after year after year so i have as president urge the speaker of the house of representatives mr. mccormack and the other leader and member of my own party to lead the way in this movement but to all of those who believe in our two party elective system to all of those who believe in taxation with representation to those who believe in keep faith with our own people i express the hope that you too will join we in this effort

 i be now ready to take any question that you may have to ask

 q. mr. president the steel negotiator still seem to be considerably apart on an agreement and a strike be threaten within a week would you care to comment on that situation

 the president yes i think that the steel situation be on almost every citizen 's mind in this country the decision which will be make in pittsburgh this week be of vital importance to every person in this country and to people in other part of the world there must be continue cost and price stability in our american economy and i expect full and complete responsibility in the current wage negotiation and i expect continue stability in steel price

 as we meet here today we be trouble with many question but we must never forget that our boy be still fight in south viet nam and that our economic strength be the keystone of free world peace it be extremely important to the security that we hold very dear so the decision that will be make this week by steel management and by labor in the day that be ahead must certainly take into account the overall great national interest which be involve

 the director of the federal mediation service one of my most trust public servant mr. william simkin be in pittsburgh and he be there for the purpose of make every contribution he can to assist the party in reach a responsible agreement the eye of this country be on the leader of both management and labor we be expect and we believe we will receive the responsibility which the national interest requires.6

 q. mr. president in world war ii there be notable air strike which completely knock out in single raid vast industrial complex and transportation facility yet in the war in viet nam we read from over there of repeat case of where it take several raid to demobilize or deactivate certain industrial installation i be think of the powerplant they be hit yesterday over and over and such thing as bridge

 be our current inability to knock out some of these big industrial complex or railroad staging area or bridge be this a purposeful thing to avoid saturation bombing or be there any other explanation

 the president no i think that our operation have be up to our expectation i think a review and evaluation of they will reflect that they have be rather effective and i think that they be in keep with the plan purpose of their mission

 q. mr. president do you think the so call white paper issue by house republicans under the leadership of congressman ford have inject undue partisanship into the viet nam situation

 the president well i do not want to get into any personality in the matter i think the issue of war and peace in viet nam be far great than any personal difference that one might have for that matter far great than any party 's

 i have say on many occasion and i should like to repeat to the american people and to hanoi also that i be very pleased with the support the american people be give to the policy of their government both at home and abroad while our man be fight and die for freedom in south viet nam i be go to do everything that i can to support those man and to unite the country behind they

 i think that generally speak the country be unite behind they and i think this will be a source of strength to our boy out there i have receive excellent cooperation from the leadership of both party in the past and i expect to continue in the future the boy that be fight the war be not divide between republicans and democrats the man direct the strategy involve i do not know what party they belong to

 the distinguished secretary of defense before come into government be a member of a party different from mine the president with whom i counsel often and who have have the great experience in not only political and diplomatic matter but in matter of a military nature president eisenhower have be a tower of strength to i to the joint chiefs of staff to the secretary of defense and to the leader of the congress

 so i would say that we welcome expression of viewpoint from the leadership in both party there will be time when we do not see everything alike but that may contribute strength to our system

 i do not think that hanoi should ever for a moment entertain the illusion that the people of this country be not unite in the work of this government

 q. the congressional session be almost over and what be the prospect of the immigration bill pass and could you assess for we some of the long range effect of it if it pass

 the president i do not know how good a prophet i be i have put this legislation very high in our list i think it be extremely important i have continually urge the leadership to proceed with this consideration the house have it under study now i have talk to the speaker at length yesterday and again today

 i be send he a letter later today express very strongly the view of the executive branch of the government again i be hope that that bill will pass as report by the house judiciary committee without crippling amendment it have not be act upon yet by the senate judiciary committee

 i believe that it should be act on before the congress get out of here i favor the house bill i think it will result in a great improvement not only in our relation with other nation but will be very satisfying to large segment of our own people i believe it will pass i would like to have the help of all of you though in that connection

 q. mr. president do you believe that the guideline of your administration and mr. kennedy 's administration lay down on wage and price stability apply to federal employee and if so do you believe that the civilian pay raise bill now report out of the house committee violate those guideline

 the president i would think that the federal government have a different situation from what we have in certain segment of our private sector but i would hope that we would never ask for privilege for ourselves in government that we would not expect private industry to share in

 therefore when you make allowance for the difference in public and private employment and the various policy and fringe benefit i would hope that we could keep our civilian pay structure in line with the guideline that we recommend for private industry

 i do think the house bill go too far i do think that it would violate the guideline i do hope that the congress will carefully and thoroughly consider the destructive effect it would have if we should pass the bill in its present form

 we have a most distinguished panel of most distinguished americans study this whole subject they make recommendation

 we would hope that the congress would enact those recommendation with certain modification that they think be require but certainly not go anywhere near the overall recommendation make by the house committee because we think that would be very disastrous to our price wage stability policy in this country and we think it would violate the guideline

 q. mr. president get back to viet nam for a moment the other night on television some of your top adviser speak in a way that seem rather point about the 1954 agreement as a possible basis for a new agreement

 do this reflect an administration emphasis and do it reflect a feeling that perhaps somebody be listen to you now sir

 the president i think that we be always hopeful that all the world be aware of our desire for discussion and our desire for negotiation and our desire for peace i do not think it be really important how much extra you get an hour in your steel contract or what the increase of federal pay be if your boy be go to be draft tomorrow and go to be call upon to give his life in viet nam

 so peace peace that simple little 5 letter word be the most important word in the english language to we at this time and it occupy more of our attention than any other word or any other subject we do expect they be listen we do hope they be listen

 secretary rusk ambassador goldberg secretary ball and all of the other train diplomat that we have in this country be go to constantly be search for way and mean to substitute word for gun and to bring man from the battlefield to the conference table our every wake hour be go to be spend try to find the mean for do this

 q. mr. president do you still consider the repeal of section 14(b of the taft hartley act a major legislative goal in this session of the congress there seem to be some question in the senate sir

 the president i do not know of any question i certainly do

 q. sir have you be in contact with governor collins about the situation in los angeles

 the president yes

 q. do you have in mind any action which might avert further tension

 the president yes sir we have detailed action plan that we work on until late in the evening last night mr. moyers will have a release available for you we do not want to take the television time and further time from your question but it will be available later in the week

 we be appoint a top flight task force head by deputy attorney general ramsey clark and they will proceed to los angeles at a very early date the detail of their work and their program will be announce as soon as they be available

 q. mr. president have we come to any close solution to the problem in the dominican republic

 the president ambassador bunker have do a very exceptional job there we be very hopeful that we can obtain agreement on provisional government and that we can set up the guideline that will result in an election at an early date where the people of that area can have self determination and can make the selection of their own government official we have feel very close to a solution several time and we never be quite sure when it will come but we expect it shortly

 q. mr. president you say yesterday that what you really want for your birthday tomorrow be several bill out of committee but you do not say what the bill be would you care to tell we sir

 the president i do not have the time to review all of my message but as i remember it there be about four bill still in house committee that have not be report that be be work upon

 they include the highway improvement bill beautification bill and the heart cancer and stroke bill larry o'brien be a much well authority on this than i be he will be glad to be helpful in that respect there be some eight bill in senate committee that still need to be report

 there be a dozen or so bill that have be report that need to be schedule they be either await a rule or await schedule in one body or the other

 there be about six bill in conference one of which have emerge recently much to our satisfaction the foreign aid bill we be hopeful that all of those measure can be move there be relatively few to be report there be a good many more to be schedule there be only half a dozen in conference

 we think that in a reasonable time by diligent work not around the clock but a full week in the next several week we can complete our program if we could we would like to do that so that the member could go home and have some rest before come back in january

 there will be some important message for they await they when they return in january but we would not expect anything like the volume of substantive legislation next year we would expect several substantive bill like a transportation policy and like some refinement in our foreign policy that we will be submit message on food and health and thing of that nature but we look forward to the congress be able to get out of here early next year i would say certainly far ahead of the end of the fiscal year in june so that the member could be at home and could report to the people

 we like for the republicans and the democrats all to be home and report to the people what be go on here what be go on in the world so they can be fully inform and we think that it make for a more united country

 q. mr. president of late sir have you be able to detect any military advantage in viet nam have we turn the corner there after it have go apparently so bad for so long

 the president i be always hesitant to make a prophecy about how good thing be or how bad they be because you fellow have a way of remember what a public official say way back there and feed it up to he from time to time

 but i think it must be evident to you that your marines and your other soldier in the army and the man in the navy and the air force have be give a good account of themselves and work very closely with the dedicated and patriotic and determine south vietnamese always associate with they and work with they they have be quite effective in the last few week

 as i tell you in our last meeting i plead with my cabinet every time i see they i say to secretary mcnamara you be sure that our man have the morale and have the equipment and have the necessary mean of see that we keep our commitment in viet nam and we have the strength to do it

 i say to mr. rusk while he be work with his right hand on strength and stability there and do the job we be commit to do you and mr. goldberg and the rest of you use that leave hand and be sure that you do everything to get we away from the battlefield and back at the conference table if that be possible

 so we be like a man in a ring we be use our right and our left constantly

 q. it seem increasingly possible mr. president that the conflict between indonesia and malaysia could erupt into an earthquake that would affect southeast asia far more gravely than anything that be go on in viet nam today

 would you assess that danger for we include the point as to whether you think it be possible to keep indonesia from completely go into the communist chinese orbit

 the president i would agree that the whole situation there be very delicate a matter that require constant watching our secretary of state be do that the president be do it we have recently send to indonesia one of our most train and trusted diplomat we be go to make every contribution that we can to try to preserve peace in that area

 we think that what we be do in south viet nam have a very important bearing on the whole sector of that part of the world i would not want to make any prophecy as to what the final outcome would be other than we will be hopeful and we will be continue in our effort to contribute anything we can to a peaceful solution

 q. mr. president sir you veto the military construction bill the other day and say you do it because it be repugnant to the constitution some people disagree with you they think that very clearly while your power be limit by the constitution the power of congress be extensive

 i would refer you to section 8 of the constitution where it say that congress will make all the rule for government and regulation of the land and naval force do not you think you might reconsider that

 the president well first i review that veto message very carefully late in the evening of the last day with most of my good legal adviser the statement as i remember it say that the attorney general inform i that it be repugnant to the constitution so i would refer you first to the attorney general and i know he would be glad to give great weight to any observation you might have

 i myself agree with the attorney general i hope the congress will share that view i think that we do owe the congress a reasonable reporting procedure i indicate in my message that i would willingly make those report if it could be work out where it would not adversely affect our military posture or my duty as commander in chief

 i genuinely believe that the bill in the form that i veto it do considerably restrain the commander in chief and be not in the national interest

 thank you mr. president

 i recommend to you a program to rebuild completely on a scale never before attempt entire central and slum area of several of our city in america

 i recommend that you attack the wasteful and degrading poisoning of our river and as the cornerstone of this effort clean completely entire large river basin

 i recommend that you meet the grow menace of crime in the street by build up law enforcement and by revitalize the entire federal system from prevention to probation

 i recommend that you take additional step to insure equal justice to all of our people by effectively enforce nondiscrimination in federal and state jury selection by make it a serious federal crime to obstruct public and private effort to secure civil right and by outlaw discrimination in the sale and rental of housing

 i recommend that you help i modernize and streamline the federal government by create a new cabinet level department of transportation and reorganize several exist agency in turn i will restructure our civil service in the top grade so that man and woman can easily be assign to job where they be most need and ability will be both require as well as reward

 i will ask you to make it possible for member of the house of representatives to work more effectively in the service of the nation through a constitutional amendment extend the term of a congressman to four year concurrent with that of the president

 because of vietnam we can not do all that we should or all that we would like to do we will ruthlessly attack waste and inefficiency we will make sure that every dollar be spend with the thrift and with the commonsense which recognize how hard the taxpayer work in order to earn it

 we will continue to meet the need of our people by continue to develop the great society

 last year alone the wealth that we produce increase $ 47 billion and it will soar again this year to a total over $ 720 billion

 because our economic policy have produce rise revenue if you approve every program that i recommend tonight our total budget deficit will be one of the low in many year it will be only $ 1.8 billion next year total spending in the administrative budget will be $ 112.8 billion revenue next year will be $ 111 billion

 on a cash basis which be the way that you and i keep our family budget the federal budget next year will actually show a surplus that be to say if we include all the money that your government will take in and all the money that your government will spend your government next year will collect one half billion dollar more than it will spend in the year 1967

 i have not come here tonight to ask for pleasant luxury or for idle pleasure i have come here to recommend that you the representative of the rich nation on earth you the elect servant of a people who live in abundance unmatched on this globe you bring the most urgent decency of life to all of your fellow americans

 there be man who cry out we must sacrifice well let we rather ask they who will they sacrifice be they go to sacrifice the child who seek the learning or the sick who need medical care or the family who dwell in squalor now brighten by the hope of home will they sacrifice opportunity for the distressed the beauty of our land the hope of our poor

 time may require further sacrifice and if it do then we will make they

 but we will not heed those who wring it from the hope of the unfortunate here in a land of plenty

 i believe that we can continue the great society while we fight in vietnam but if there be some who do not believe this then in the name of justice let they call for the contribution of those who live in the fullness of our blessing rather than try to strip it from the hand of those that be most in need

 and let no one think that the unfortunate and the oppressed of this land sit stifle and alone in their hope tonight hundred of their servant and their protector sit before i tonight here in this great chamber

 the great society lead we along three road growth and justice and liberation

 first be growth the national prosperity which support the well being of our people and which provide the tool of our progress

 i can report to you tonight what you have see for yourself already in every city and countryside this nation be flourish

 worker be make more money than ever with after tax income in the past five year up 33 percent in the last year alone up 8 percent

 more people be work than ever before in our history an increase last year of two and a half million job

 corporation have great after tax earning than ever in history for the past five year those earning have be up over 65 percent and last year alone they have a rise of 20 percent

 average farm income be high than ever over the past five year it be up 40 percent and over the past year it be up 22 percent alone

 i be inform this afternoon by the distinguished secretary of the treasury that his preliminary estimate indicate that our balance of payment deficit have be reduce from $ 2.8 billion in 1964 to $ 1.3 billion or less in 1965 this achievement have be make possible by the patriotic voluntary cooperation of businessman and banker work with your government

 we must now work together with increase urgency to wipe out this balance of payment deficit altogether in the next year

 and as our economy surge toward new height we must increase our vigilance against the inflation which raise the cost of living and which lower the saving of every family in this land it be essential to prevent inflation that we ask both labor and business to exercise price and wage restraint and i do so again tonight

 i believe it desirable because of increase military expenditure that you temporarily restore the automobile and certain telephone excise tax reduction make effective only 12 day ago without raise taxis or even increase the total tax bill pay we should move to improve our withholding system so that americans can more realistically pay as they go speed up the collection of corporate taxis and make other necessary simplification of the tax structure at an early date

 i hope these measure will be adequate but if the necessity of vietnam require it i will not hesitate to return to the congress for additional appropriation or additional revenue if they be need

 the second road be justice justice mean a man 's hope should not be limit by the color of his skin

 i propose legislation to establish unavoidable requirement for nondiscriminatory jury selection in federal and state court and to give the attorney general the power necessary to enforce those requirement

 i propose legislation to strengthen authority of federal court to try those who murder attack or intimidate either civil right worker or other exercise their constitutional right and to increase penalty to a level equal to the nature of the crime

 legislation rest on the full constitutional authority of the federal government to prohibit racial discrimination in the sale or rental of housing

 for that other nation within a nation the poor whose distress have now capture the conscience of america i will ask the congress not only to continue but to speed up the war on poverty and in so do we will provide the add energy of achievement with the increase efficiency of experience

 to improve the life of our rural americans and our farm population we will plan for the future through the establishment of several new community development districts improve education through the use of teacher corps team well health measure physical examination and adequate and available medical resource

 for those who labor i propose to improve unemployment insurance to expand minimum wage benefit and by the repeal of section 14(b of the taft hartley act to make the labor law in all our state equal to the law of the 31 state which do not have tonight right to work measure

 and i also intend to ask the congress to consider measure which without improperly invade state and local authority will enable we effectively to deal with strike which threaten irreparable damage to the national interest

 the third path be the path of liberation it be to use our success for the fulfillment of our life a great nation be one which breed a great people a great people flower not from wealth and power but from a society which spur they to the fullness of their genius that alone be a great society

 yet slowly painfully on the edge of victory have come the knowledge that share prosperity be not enough in the midst of abundance modern man walk oppress by force which menace and confine the quality of his life and which individual abundance alone will not overcome

 we can subdue and we can master these force bring increase meaning to our life if all of we government and citizen be bold enough to change old way dare enough to assault new danger and if the dream be dear enough to call forth the limitless capacity of this great people

 this year we must continue to improve the quality of american life

 let we fulfill and improve the great health and education program of last year extend special opportunity to those who risk their life in our armed force

 i urge the house of representatives to complete action on three program already pass by the senate the teacher corps rent assistance and home rule for the district of columbia

 in some of our urban area we must help rebuild entire section and neighborhood contain in some case as many as 100,000 people work together private enterprise and government must press forward with the task of provide home and shop park and hospital and all the other necessary part of a flourish community where our people can come to live the good life

 i will offer other proposal to stimulate and to reward plan for the growth of entire metropolitan area

 of all the reckless devastation of our national heritage none be really more shameful than the continue poisoning of our river and our air

 we must undertake a cooperative effort to end pollution in several river basin make additional fund available to help draw the plan and construct the plant that be necessary to make the water of our entire river system clean and make they a source of pleasure and beauty for all of our people

 to attack and to overcome grow crime and lawlessness i think we must have a step up program to help modernize and strengthen our local police force

 our people have a right to feel secure in their home and on their street and that right just must be secure

 nor can we fail to arrest the destruction of life and property on our highway

 i will propose a highway safety act of 1966 to seek an end to this mount tragedy

 we must also act to prevent the deception of the american consumer require all package to state clearly and truthfully their content all interest and credit charge to be fully reveal and keep harmful drug and cosmetic away from our store

 it be the genius of our constitution that under its shelter of endure institution and rooted principle there be ample room for the rich fertility of american political invention we must change to master change

 i propose to take step to modernize and streamline the executive branch to modernize the relation between city and state and nation

 a new department of transportation be need to bring together our transportation activity the present structure—35 government agency spend $ 5 billion yearly make it almost impossible to serve either the grow demand of this great nation or the need of the industry or the right of the taxpayer to full efficiency and real frugality

 i will propose in addition a program to construct and to flight test a new supersonic transport airplane that will fly three time the speed of sound in excess of 2,000 mile per hour

 i propose to examine our federal system the relation between city state nation and the citizen themselves we need a commission of the most distinguished scholar and man of public affair to do this job i will ask they to move on to develop a creative federalism to well use the wonderful diversity of our institution and our people to solve the problem and to fulfill the dream of the american people

 as the process of election become more complex and more costly we must make it possible for those without personal wealth to enter public life without be obligate to a few large contributor

 therefore i will submit legislation to revise the present unrealistic restriction on contribution to prohibit the endless proliferation of committee bring local and state committee under the act to attach strong tooth and severe penalty to the requirement of full disclosure of contribution and to broaden the participation of the people through add tax incentive to stimulate small contribution to the party and to the candidate of their choice

 to strengthen the work of congress i strongly urge an amendment to provide a four year term for member of the house of representatives which should not begin before 1972

 the present two year term require most member of congress to divert enormous energy to an almost constant process of campaigning deprive this nation of the full measure of both their skill and their wisdom today too the work of government be far more complex than in our early year require more time to learn and more time to master the technical task of legislating and a long term will serve to attract more man of the high quality to political life the nation the principle of democracy and i think each congressional district will all be well serve by a four year term for member of the house and i urge your swift action

 tonight the cup of peril be full in vietnam that conflict be not an isolated episode but another great event in the policy that we have follow with strong consistency since world war ii

 the touchstone of that policy be the interest of the united states the welfare and the freedom of the people of the united states but nation sink when they see that interest only through a narrow glass

 in a world that have grow small and dangerous pursuit of narrow aim could bring decay and even disaster

 an america that be mighty beyond description yet live in a hostile or despairing world would be neither safe nor free to build a civilization to liberate the spirit of man

 in this pursuit we help rebuild western europe we give our aid to greece and turkey and we defend the freedom of berlin

 in this pursuit we have help new nation toward independence we have extend the help hand of the peace corps and carry forward the large program of economic assistance in the world

 and in this pursuit we work to build a hemisphere of democracy and of social justice

 in this pursuit we have defend against communist aggression in korea under president truman in the formosa straits under president eisenhower in cuba under president kennedy and again in vietnam

 tonight vietnam must hold the center of our attention but across the world problem and opportunity crowd in on the american nation i will discuss they fully in the month to come and i will follow the five continue line of policy that america have follow under its last four president

 the first principle be strength tonight i can tell you that we be strong enough to keep all of our commitment we will need expenditure of $ 58.3 billion for the next fiscal year to maintain this necessary defense might

 while special vietnam expenditure for the next fiscal year be estimate to increase by $ 5.8 billion i can tell you that all the other expenditure put together in the entire federal budget will rise this come year by only $ 0.6 billion this be true because of the stringent cost conscious economy program inaugurate in the defense department and follow by the other department of government

 a second principle of policy be the effort to control and to reduce and to ultimately eliminate the modern engine of destruction

 we will vigorously pursue exist proposal and seek new one to control arm and to stop the spread of nuclear weapon

 a third major principle of our foreign policy be to help build those association of nation which reflect the opportunity and the necessity of the modern world

 by strengthen the common defense by stimulate world commerce by meet new hope these association serve the cause of a flourish world

 we will take new step this year to help strengthen the alliance for progress the unity of europe the community of the atlantic the regional organization of develop continent and that supreme association the united nations

 we will work to strengthen economic cooperation to reduce barrier to trade and to improve international finance

 a fourth endure strand of policy have be to help improve the life of man

 from the marshall plan to this very moment tonight that policy have rest on the claim of compassion and the certain knowledge that only a people advance in expectation will build secure and peaceful land

 this year i propose major new direction in our program of foreign assistance to help those country who will help themselves

 we will conduct a worldwide attack on the problem of hunger and disease and ignorance

 we will place the matchless skill and the resource of our own great america in farming and in fertilizer at the service of those country commit to develop a modern agriculture

 we will aid those who educate the young in other land and we will give child in other continent the same head start that we be try to give our own child to advance these end i will propose the international education act of 1966

 i will also propose the international health act of 1966 to strike at disease by a new effort to bring modern skill and knowledge to the uncared for those suffer in the world and by try to wipe out smallpox and malaria and control yellow fever over most of the world during this next decade to help country try to control population growth by increase our research and we will earmark fund to help their effort

 in the next year from our foreign aid source we propose to dedicate $ 1 billion to these effort and we call on all who have the mean to join we in this work in the world

 the fifth and most important principle of our foreign policy be support of national independence the right of each people to govern themselves and to shape their own institution

 for a peaceful world order will be possible only when each country walk the way that it have choose to walk for itself

 we follow this principle by encourage the end of colonial rule

 we follow this principle abroad as well as at home by continued hostility to the rule of the many by the few or the oppression of one race by another

 we follow this principle by build bridge to eastern europe and i will ask the congress for authority to remove the special tariff restriction which be a barrier to increase trade between the east and the west

 the insistent urge toward national independence be the strong force of today 's world in which we live

 in africa and asia and latin america it be shatter the design of those who would subdue other to their idea or their will

 it be erode the unity of what be once a stalinist empire

 in recent month a number of nation have east out those who would subject they to the ambition of mainland china

 history be on the side of freedom and be on the side of society shape from the genius of each people history do not favor a single system or belief unless force be use to make it so

 that be why it have be necessary for we to defend this basic principle of our policy to defend it in berlin in korea in cuba and tonight in vietnam

 for tonight as so many night before young americans struggle and young americans die in a distant land

 tonight as so many night before the american nation be ask to sacrifice the blood of its child and the fruit of its labor for the love of its freedom

 how many time in my lifetime and in your have the american people gather as they do now to hear their president tell they of conflict and tell they of danger

 each time they have answer they have answer with all the effort that the security and the freedom of this nation require

 and they do again tonight in vietnam not too many year ago vietnam be a peaceful if trouble land in the north be an independent communist government in the south a people struggle to build a nation with the friendly help of the united states

 there be some in south vietnam who wish to force communist rule on their own people but their progress be slight their hope of success be dim then little more than six year ago north vietnam decide on conquest and from that day to this soldier and supply have move from north to south in a swell stream that be swallow the remnant of revolution in aggression

 as the assault mount our choice gradually become clear we could leave abandon south vietnam to its attacker and to certain conquest or we could stay and fight beside the people of south vietnam we stay

 and we will stay until aggression have stop

 we will stay because a just nation can not leave to the cruelty of its enemy a people who have stake their life and independence on america 's solemn pledge a pledge which have grow through the commitment of three american president

 we will stay because in asia and around the world be country whose independence rest in large measure on confidence in america 's word and in america 's protection to yield to force in vietnam would weaken that confidence would undermine the independence of many land and would whet the appetite of aggression we would have to fight in one land and then we would have to fight in another or abandon much of asia to the domination of communists

 and we do not intend to abandon asia to conquest

 last year the nature of the war in vietnam change again swiftly increase number of armed man from the north cross the border to join force that be already in the south attack and terror increase spur and encourage by the belief that the united states lack the will to continue and that their victory be near

 despite our desire to limit conflict it be necessary to act to hold back the mount aggression to give courage to the people of the south and to make our firmness clear to the north thus we begin limited air action against military target in north vietnam we increase our fighting force to its present strength tonight of 190,000 man

 these move have not end the aggression but they have prevent its success the aim of the enemy have be put out of reach by the skill and the bravery of americans and their ally and by the endure courage of the south vietnamese who i can tell you have lose eight man last year for every one of our

 the enemy be no long close to victory time be no long on his side there be no cause to doubt the american commitment

 our decision to stand firm have be match by our desire for peace

 in 1965 alone we have 300 private talk for peace in vietnam with friend and adversary throughout the world

 since christmas your government have labor again with imagination and endurance to remove any barrier to peaceful settlement for 20 day now we and our vietnamese ally have drop no bomb in north vietnam

 able and experienced spokesman have visit in behalf of america more than 40 country we have talk to more than a hundred government all 113 that we have relation with and some that we do not we have talk to the united nations and we have call upon all of its member to make any contribution that they can toward helping obtain peace

 in public statement and in private communication to adversary and to friend in rome and warsaw in paris and tokyo in africa and throughout this hemisphere america have make her position abundantly clear

 we seek neither territory nor basis economic domination or military alliance in vietnam we fight for the principle of self determination that the people of south vietnam should be able to choose their own course choose it in free election without violence without terror and without fear

 the people of all vietnam should make a free decision on the great question of reunification

 this be all we want for south vietnam it be all the people of south vietnam want and if there be a single nation on this earth that desire less than this for its own people then let its voice be hear

 we have also make it clear from hanoi to new york that there be no arbitrary limit to our search for peace we stand by the geneva agreements of 1954 and 1962 we will meet at any conference table we will discuss any proposal four point or 14 or 40 and we will consider the view of any group we will work for a cease fire now or once discussion have begin we will respond if other reduce their use of force and we will withdraw our soldier once south vietnam be securely guarantee the right to shape its own future

 we have say all this and we have ask and hope and we have wait for a response

 so far we have receive no response to prove either success or failure

 we have carry our quest for peace to many nation and people because we share this planet with other whose future in large measure be tie to our own action and whose counsel be necessary to our own hope

 we have find understanding and support and we know they wait with we tonight for some response that could lead to peace

 i wish tonight that i could give you a blueprint for the course of this conflict over the come month but we just can not know what the future may require we may have to face long hard combat or a long hard conference or even both at once

 until peace come or if it do not come our course be clear we will act as we must to help protect the independence of the valiant people of south vietnam we will strive to limit the conflict for we wish neither increase destruction nor do we want to invite increase danger

 but we will give our fighting man what they must have every gun and every dollar and every decision whatever the cost or whatever the challenge

 and we will continue to help the people of south vietnam care for those that be ravage by battle create progress in the village and carry forward the heal hope of peace as well they can amidst the uncertain terror of war

 and let i be absolutely clear the day may become month and the month may become year but we will stay as long as aggression command we to battle

 there may be some who do not want peace whose ambition stretch so far that war in vietnam be but a welcome and convenient episode in an immense design to subdue history to their will but for other it must now be clear the choice be not between peace and victory it lie between peace and the ravage of a conflict from which they can only lose

 the people of vietnam north and south seek the same thing the share need of man the need for food and shelter and education the chance to build and work and till the soil free from the arbitrary horror of battle the desire to walk in the dignity of those who master their own destiny for many painful year in war and revolution and infrequent peace they have struggle to fulfill those need

 it be a crime against mankind that so much courage and so much will and so many dream must be fling on the fire of war and death

 to all of those catch up in this conflict we therefore say again tonight let we choose peace and with it the wondrous work of peace and beyond that the time when hope reach toward consummation and life be the servant of life

 in this work we plan to discharge our duty to the people whom we serve

 this be the state of the union

 but over it all wealth and promise and expectation lie our trouble awareness of american man at war tonight

 how many man who listen to i tonight have serve their nation in other war how very many be not here to listen

 the war in vietnam be not like these other war yet finally war be always the same it be young man die in the fullness of their promise it be try to kill a man that you do not even know well enough to hate

 therefore to know war be to know that there be still madness in this world

 many of you share the burden of this knowledge tonight with i but there be a difference for finally i must be the one to order our gun to fire against all the most inward pull of my desire for we have child to teach and we have sick to be cure and we have man to be free there be poor to be lift up and there be city to be build and there be a world to be help

 yet we do what we must

 i be hopeful and i will try as well i can with everything i have get to end this battle and to return our son to their desire

 yet as long as other will challenge america 's security and test the clearness of our belief with fire and steel then we must stand or see the promise of two century tremble i believe tonight that you do not want i to try that risk and from that belief your president summon his strength for the trial that lie ahead in the day to come

 the work must be our work now scar by the weakness of man with whatever guidance god may offer we we must nevertheless and alone with our mortality strive to ennoble the life of man on earth

 thank you and goodnight

good morning lady and gentleman

 for 37 day no bomb fall on north vietnam during that time we have make a most intensive and determined effort to enlist the help and the support of all the world in order to persuade the government in hanoi that peace be well than war that talking be well than fight and that the road to peace be open

 our effort have meet with understanding and support throughout most of the world but not in hanoi and peking from those two capital have come only denunciation and rejection

 in these 37 day the effort of our ally have be rebuff the effort of neutral nation have come to nothing we have seek without success to learn of any response to effort make by the government of eastern europe there have be no answer to the enlightened effort of the vatican our own direct private approach have all be in vain

 the answer of hanoi to all be the answer that be publish 3 day ago they persist in aggression they insist on the surrender of south vietnam to communism it be therefore very plain that there be no readiness or willingness to talk no readiness for peace in that regime today

 and what be plain in word be also plain in act throughout these 37 day even at moment of truce there have be continue violence against the people of south vietnam against their government against their soldier and against our own american force

 we do not regret the pause in the bombing we yield to none in our determination to seek peace we have give a full and decent respect to the opinion of those who think that such a pause might give new hope for peace in the world

 some say that 10 day might do it other say 20 now we have pause for twice the time suggest by some of those who urge it and now the world know more clearly than it have ever know before who it be that insist on aggression and who it be that work for peace

 the vietnamese american and ally troop that be engage in south vietnam with increase strength and increase success want peace i be sure as much as any of we here at home but while there be no peace those man be entitle to the full support of american strength and american determination and we will give they both

 as constitutional commander in chief i have as i must give proper weight to the judgment of those all of those who have any responsibility for counseling with i or share with i the burdensome decision that i be call upon to make the distinguished secretary of state the secretary of defense my national security adviser and america 's professional military man represent by the joint chiefs of staff

 these adviser tell i that if continue immunity be give to all that support north vietnam aggression the cost in life vietnamese life and american life and allied life will only be greatly increase

 in the light of the word and action of the government in hanoi for more than 37 day now it be our clear duty to do what we can to limit these cost

 so on this monday morning in vietnam at my direction after complete and thorough consultation and agreement with the government of south vietnam united states aircraft have resume action in north vietnam

 they strike the line of supply which support the continue movement of man and arm against the people and the government of south vietnam

 our air strike on north vietnam from the beginning have be aim at military target and have be control with the great of care those who direct and supply the aggression really have no claim to immunity from military reply

 the end of the pause do not mean the end of our own pursuit of peace that pursuit will be as determined and as unremitting as the pressure of our military strength on the field of battle

 in our continue pursuit of peace i have instruct ambassador goldberg at the united nations to ask for an immediate meeting of the united nations security council he will present a full report on the situation in vietnam and a resolution which can open the way to the conference table

 this report and this resolution will be responsive to the spirit of the renew appeal of pope paul and that appeal have our full sympathy

 i have ask secretary rusk to meet with the representative of the press later this morning to give to the country and to the entire world a thorough and a comprehensive account of all of the diplomatic effort conduct in these last 5 week in our continue policy of peace and freedom for south vietnam

mr. chief justice mr. secretary senator kennedy members of the fine delegation from new york lady and gentleman at the head table my fellow americans

 to be honor with this award by this organization be a very proud moment for i i accept it with the gratitude of my heart and with renew commitment to the cause that it represent the cause of freedom at home and the cause of freedom abroad

 twenty five year ago to a world that be darken by war president franklin roosevelt describe the four freedom of mankind

 --freedom of speech and expression

 --freedom of every person to worship god in his own way

 --freedom from want

 --freedom from fear

 franklin roosevelt know that these freedom could not be the province of one people alone he call on all his countryman to assist those who endure the tyrant 's bomb and suffer his opposition and oppression

 he call for courage and for generosity and for resolution in the face of terror and then he say

 freedom mean the supremacy of human right everywhere our support go to those who struggle to gain those right or keep they

 wendell willkie franklin roosevelt 's opponent in the campaign of 1940 share his belief that freedom could not be found only on american shore or only for those whose skin be white freedom be an indivisible word wendell willkie say if we want to enjoy it and fight for it we must be prepare to extend it to everyone whether they be rich or poor whether they agree with we or not no matter what their race or the color of their skin

 that be republican policy 25 year ago it be democratic policy 25 year ago it be americana policy here tonight

 then how well have we do in our time in make the four freedom real for our people and for the other people of the world

 here in america we accord every man the right to worship as he will i believe we be more tolerant of sectional and religious and racial difference than we be a quarter of a century ago the majority of our people believe that a qualified man or woman of any race of any religion of any section could hold any office in our land this be not so not very dear at all in 1940

 we be commit now however great the trial and tension to protect the right of free expression and peaceful dissent we have learn to despise the witch hunt the unprincipled harassment of a man 's integrity and his right to be different we have gain in tolerance and i be determined to use the high office i hold to protect and to encourage that tolerance

 i do not mean to say that i will remain altogether silent on the critical issue of our day for just as strongly as i believe in other man 's freedom to disagree so do i also believe in the president 's freedom to attempt to persuade

 so let i assure you and my fellow americans tonight that i will do everything in my power to defend both

 twenty five year ago freedom from want have the ring of urgency for our people the unemployment rate stand at 14.5 percent million of americans have spend the last decade in the breadline or on farm where the wind howl away any chance for a decent life

 tonight there be still million whose poverty haunt our conscience there be still father without job and there be still child without hope

 yet for the vast majority of americans these be time when the hand of plenty have replace the grip of want and for the first time in almost 9 year tonight the unemployment rate have fall to 4 percent

 this liberation from want for which we thank god be a testimony to the endure vitality of the american competitive system the american free enterprise economy

 it be a testimony also to an enlightened public policy establish by franklin roosevelt and strengthen by every administration since his death

 that policy have free americans for more hopeful and more productive life

 it have relieve their fear of grow old by social security and by medical care

 it have inspire they with hope for their child by aid to elementary and high education

 it have help to create economic opportunity by enlightened fiscal policy

 it have grant to million bear into hopelessness the chance of a new start in life by public work by private incentive by poverty program

 for the negro american it have open the door after century of enslavement and discrimination open the door to the blessing that america offer to those that be willing and able to earn they

 thus we address the spirit of franklin roosevelt 25 year after his message to america and the world with confidence and with an unflagging determination we have serve his vision of the four freedom essential to mankind here in america

 yet we know that he do not speak only for america we know that the four freedom be not secure in america when they be violently deny elsewhere in the world we know too that it require more than speech to resist the international enemy of freedom we know that man respond to deed when they be deaf to word even the precious word freedom may become empty to those without the mean to use it

 for what do freedom mean

 --when famine choke the land

 --when new million crowd upon already strain resource

 --when narrow privilege be entrench behind law and custom

 --when all conspire to teach man that they can not change the condition of their life

 i do not need to tell you how five administration have labor to give real meaning to freedom in a world where it be often merely a phrase that conceal oppression and neglect

 man in this room man throughout america have give their skill and their treasure to that work you have warn our people how insatiable be aggression and how it thrive on human misery

 you have carry the word that without the sense that they can change the condition of their life nothing can avail the oppressed of this earth neither good will nor national sovereignty nor massive grant of aid from their more fortunate brother

 you have know too that man who believe they can change their destiny will change their destiny

 arm with that belief they will be willing yes they will be eager to make the sacrifice that freedom demand they will be anxious to shoulder the responsibility that be inseparably bind to freedom

 they will be able to look beyond the four essential freedom

 --beyond to the freedom to learn to master new skill to acquaint themselves with the lore of man and nature

 --to the freedom to grow to become the good that be within they to become to cast off the yoke of discrimination and disease

 --to the freedom to hope and to build on that hope life of integrity and well being

 this be what our struggle in vietnam be all about tonight this be what our struggle for equal right in this country be all about tonight

 we seek to create that climate at home and abroad where unlettered man can learn where deprived child can grow where hopeless million can be inspire to change the term of their existence for the well

 that climate can not be create where terror fill the air

 child can not learn and man can not earn their bread and woman can not heal the sick where the night of violence have blot out the sun

 whether in the city and hamlet of vietnam or in the ghetto of our own city the struggle be the same that struggle be to end the violence against the human mind and body so that the work of peace may be do and the fruit of freedom may be win

 we be pit the resource of the law of education and training of our vision and our compassion against that violence here in america and we shall end it in our time

 on the other side of the earth we be no less committed to end violence against man who be struggle tonight to be free

 and it be about that commitment that i have come here to speak now

 tonight in vietnam more than 200,000 of your young americans stand there fight for your freedom tonight our people be determined that these man shall have whatever help they need and that their cause which be our cause shall be sustain but in these last day there have be question about what we be do in vietnam and these question have be answer loudly and clearly for every citizen to see and to hear the strength of america can never be sap by discussion and we have no well nor strong tradition than open debate free debate in hour of danger we believe with macaulay that man be never so likely to settle a question rightly as when they discuss it freely

 we be unite in our commitment to free discussion so also we be unite in our determination that no foe anywhere should ever mistake our argument for indecision nor our debate for weakness

 so what be the question that be still be ask

 first some ask if this be a war for unlimited objective the answer be plain the answer be no our purpose in vietnam be to prevent the success of aggression it be not conquest it be not empire it be not foreign basis it be not domination

 it be simply put just to prevent the forceful conquest of south vietnam by north vietnam

 second some people ask if we be catch in a blind escalation of force that be pull we headlong toward a wide war that no one want the answer again be a simple no we be use that force and only that force that be necessary to stop this aggression our fight man be in vietnam because ten of thousand of invader come south before they our number have increase in vietnam because the aggression of other have increase in vietnam the high hope of the aggressor have be dim and the tide of the battle have be turn and our measured use of force will and must be continue but this be prudent firmness under what i believe be careful control there be not and there will not be a mindless escalation

 third other ask if our fight man be to be deny the help they need the answer again be and will be a resounding no our great military establishment have move 200,000 man across 10,000 mile since last spring

 these man have and will have all they need to fight the aggressor they have already perform miracle in combat and the man behind they have work miracle of supply build new port transport new equipment open new road

 the american force of freedom be strong tonight in south vietnam and we plan to keep they so as you know they be lead there by a brilliant and a resourceful commander gen. william c. westmoreland he know the need of war and he support the work of peace and when he ask for more americans to help the man that he have his request will be immediately study and as i promise the nation last july his need will be immediately meet

 fourth some ask if our man go alone to vietnam if we alone respect our great commitment in the southeast asia treaty still again the answer be a simple no we have seven ally in seato and we have see five of they give we vital support each with his own strength and in his own way to the cause of freedom in southeast asia

 fifth some ask about the risk of a wide war perhaps against the vast land army of red china and again the answer be no never by any act of our and not if there be any reason leave behind the wild word from peking

 we have threaten no one and we will not

 we seek the end of no regime and we will not

 our purpose be solely to defend against aggression to any armed attack we will reply we have measure the strength and the weakness of other and we think we know our own we observe in ourselves and we applaud in other a careful restraint in action we can live with anger in word as long as it be match by caution in deed

 sixth man ask if we rely on gun alone still again the answer be no from our honolulu meeting from the clear pledge which join we with our ally in saigon there have emerge a common dedication to the peaceful progress of the people of vietnam to school for their child to care for their health to hope and bounty for their land

 the vice president return tonight from his constructive and very highly successful visit to saigon and to other capital and he tell i that he and ambassador lodge have find a new conviction and purpose in south vietnam for the battle against want and injustice as well as the battle against aggression

 so the pledge of honolulu will be keep and the pledge of baltimore stand open to help the man of the north when they have the wisdom to be ready

 we americans must understand how fundamental be the meaning of this second war the war on want i talk on my ranch last fall with secretary freeman secretary of agriculture and in my office last week with secretary gardner secretary of health education and welfare make over and over again the same central point the breeding ground of war be human misery if we be not to fight forever in faraway place in europe or the far pacific or the jungle of africa or the suburb of santo domingo then we just must learn to get at the root of violence as a nation we must magnify our struggle against world hunger and illiteracy and disease we must bring hope to man whose life now end at two score or less because without that hope without progress in this war on want we will be call on again to fight again and again as we be fight tonight

 seventh man ask who have a right to rule in south vietnam our answer there be what it have be here for 200 year the people must have this right the south vietnamese people and no one else washington will not impose upon the people of south vietnam a government not of their choice hanoi shall not impose upon the people of south vietnam a government not of their choice so we will insist for ourselves on what we require from hanoi respect for the principle of government by the consent of the governed we stand for self determination for free election and we will honor their result

 eighth man ask if we be neglect any hopeful chance of peace and the answer be no a great servant of peace secretary dean rusk have send the message of peace on every wire and by every hand to every continent a great pleader for peace here with we tonight ambassador arthur goldberg have work at home and abroad in this same cause their undiscouraged effort will continue how much wise it would have be how much more compassionate towards its own people if hanoi have only come to the bargaining table at the close of the year then the 7,000 communist troop who have die in battle since january 1 and the many thousand who have be wound in that same period would have live at peace with their fellow man

 today as then hanoi have the opportunity to end the increase toll the war be take on those under its command

 ninth some ask how long we must bear this burden to that question in all honesty i can give you no answer tonight during the battle of britain when that nation stand alone in 1940 winston churchill give no answer to that question when the force of freedom be drive from the philippines president roosevelt could not and do not name the date that we would return if the aggressor persist in vietnam the struggle may well be long our man in battle know and they accept this hard fact we who be at home can do as much because there be no computer that can tell the hour and the day of peace but we do know that it will come only to the steadfast and never to the weak in heart

 tenth and finally man ask if it be worth it i think you know that answer it be the answer that americans have give for a quarter of a century wherever american strength have be pledge to prevent aggression the contest in vietnam be confused and hard and many of its form be new yet our american purpose and policy be unchanged

 our man in vietnam be there they be there as secretary dillon tell you to keep a promise that be make 12 year ago the southeast asia treaty promise as secretary john foster dulles say for the united states--"that an attack upon the treaty area would occasion a reaction so united and so strong and so well place that the aggressor would lose more than it could hope to gain but we keep more than a specific treaty promise in vietnam tonight we keep the faith for freedom

 four president have pledge to keep that faith

 the first be franklin d. roosevelt in his state of the union message 25 year ago he say

 we be commit to the proposition that principle of morality and consideration for our own security will never permit we to acquiesce in a peace dictate by aggressor and sponsor by appeaser we know that endure peace can not be buy at the cost of other people 's freedom

 the second be harry s. truman in 1947 at a historic turning point in the history of guerrilla warfare and of greece turkey and the united states these be his word then

 i believe that it must be the policy of the united states to support free people who be resist attempt subjugation by armed minority or by outside pressure

 i believe that we must assist free people to work out their own destiny in their own way

 the third be dwight d. eisenhower in his first inaugural address he promise this

 realize that common sense and common decency alike dictate the futility of appeasement we shall never try to placate an aggressor by the false and wicked bargain of trading honor for security americans indeed all free man remember that in the final choice a soldier 's pack be not so heavy a burden as a prisoner 's chain

 and then 5 year ago john f. kennedy on the cold bright noon of his first day in office proclaim

 let the word go forth from this time and place to friend and foe alike that the torch have be pass to a new generation of americans bear in this century temper by war discipline by a hard and bitter peace proud of our ancient heritage and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human right to which this nation have always be commit and to which we be commit today at home and around the world

 let every nation know whether it wish we well or ill that we shall pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty

 this be the american tradition build in free discussion prove on a hundred battlefield reward by a progress at home that have no match in history it beckon we forward tonight to the work of peace in vietnam

 we will build freedom while we fight and we will seek peace every day by every honorable mean but we will persevere along the high hard road of freedom we be too old to be foolhardy and we be too young to be tired we be too strong for fear and too determined for retreat

 each evening when i retire i take up from a bedside table report from the battlefront and report from the capital around the world they tell i how our man have fare that day in the hill and the valley of vietnam they tell i what hope there seem to be that the message of peace will be hear and that this tragic war may be end

 i read of individual act of heroism of dedicated man and woman whose valor match that of any generation that have ever go before i read of man risk their life to save other of man give their life to save freedom

 always among these report be a few letter from the man out there themselves

 if there be any doubt among some here at home about our purpose in vietnam i never find it reflect in those letter from vietnam our soldier our marines our airman and our sailor know why they be in vietnam they know as five president have know how inseparably bind together be america 's freedom and the freedom of her friend around the world

 so tonight let i read you from a letter that i receive from an american father a warm friend of mine of many year about his son a young army captain

 he say i have never know a man at war who show less bravado in his communication with home when he be not fly mission in his helicopter or work out of the battalion headquarters he and some of his buddy on their own visit the orphanage as individual and play with the kid he be deeply interested in the vietnamese people particularly the peasant and he tell i how sorely they want more than anything else to just be leave alone in some semblance of freedom to grow their rice and to raise their family

 this good young american as thousand like he be not on the other side of the world fight specifically for you or for i mr. president he be fight in perhaps our old american tradition take up for people who be king push around

 the young captain describe in this letter be dead tonight but his spirit live in the 200,000 young americans who stand out there on freedom 's frontier in vietnam it live in their mother and in their father here in america who have proudly watch they leave their home for their distant struggle

 so tonight i ask each citizen to join i to join i in the home and the meeting place our man be fight to keep free in a prayer for their safety

 i ask you to join i in a pledge to the cause for which they fight the cause of human freedom to which this great organization be dedicate

 be ask you for your help for your understanding and for your commitment so that this united people may show forth to all the world that america have not end the only struggle that be worthy of man 's uncease sacrifice the struggle to be free

mr. secretary lady and gentleman

 i be very pleased to address the foreign service institute this morning and to come here to meet with so many americans that be prepare to serve their country abroad as one who believe that we can not shorten our reach in the world i be greatly encourage by the number and the quality of those who be study at this institute you have the gratitude of your countryman and my own assurance of support

 we have come a long way from the day that someone observe that some diplomat no doubt will launch a heedless word and lurk war leap out

 that be more than half a century ago when diplomacy be often war by another name today your task be different those of you about to go abroad represent a continuity of purpose in a generation of change that purpose be to build from reason and moderation a world order in which the fire of conflict yield to the fulfillment of man 's old yearning for himself and his family

 your job wherever you serve be peace that be the task that face all of we today

 the question as always be how how do we for example maintain the security of the atlantic community upon which so many of the world 's hope depend

 for the answer we must begin with the gray dawn of the world of 1945 when europe 's city lie in rubble her farm devastate her industry smash her people weary with war and death and defeat

 now from that desolation have come abundance from that weakness have come power from those ashe of holocaust have come the rebirth of a strong and a vital community

 the europe of today be a new europe in place of uncertainty there be confidence in place of decay progress in place of isolation partnership in place of war peace

 if there be no single explanation for the difference between europe then and europe now there be a pattern it be a luminous design that be weave through the history of the past 20 year it be the design of common action of interdependent institution serve the good of the european nation as though they be all one it be the design of collective security protect the entire atlantic community

 so i have come here this morning to speak to you of one important part of that design i speak of a structure that some of you have help to build the north atlantic treaty organization

 let i make clear in the beginning that we do not believe there be any righteousness in stand pat if an organization be alive and vital if it be to have meaning for all time as well as for any particular time it must grow and respond and yield to change like our constitution which make the law of the land the north atlantic treaty be more than just a legal document it be the foundation of a live institution that institution be nato the organization create to give meaning and reality to the alliance commitment

 the crowded month which immediately precede and follow the conclusion of the north atlantic treaty 17 year ago have produce an atmosphere of crisis it be a crisis that be bear of deep fear fear for europe 's economic and political vitality fear of communist aggression fear of communist subversion

 some say that new circumstance in the world today call for the dismantling of this great organization of course nato should adapt to the change need of the time but we believe just as firmly that such change must be work by the member nation work with one another within the alliance consultation not isolation be the route to reform we must not forget either in success or abundance the lesson that we have learn in danger and in isolation that whatever the issue that we share we have one common danger division and one common safety unity

 what be our view of nato today

 we see it not as an alliance to make war but as an alliance to keep peace through an era as turbulent as man have ever know and under the constant threat of ultimate destruction nato have insure the security of the north atlantic community it have reinforce stability elsewhere throughout the world

 while nato rest on the reality that we must fight together if war should come to the atlantic area it rest also on the reality that war will not come if we act together during peace it be the foreign minister of france who in 1949 insist that to be truly secure europe need not only help in resist attack but help in prevent attack liberation he say be not enough

 the success of nato have be measure by many yardstick the most significant to i be the most obvious war have be deter through the common organization we have weld the military contribution of each of the 15 ally into a very effective instrument so convincing be this instrument that potential aggressor take stock and count as too high the price of satisfy their ambition it have be prove true that one sword keep another in the sheath

 war have be deter not only because of our integrate military power but because of the political unity of purpose to which that power have be direct and bent it be difficult to overstate the importance of the bond of culture of political institution tradition and value which form the bedrock of the atlantic community there be here a political integrity and an identity of interest that transcend personality and issue of the moment

 if our collective effort should falter and our common determination be erode the foundation of the atlantic 's present stability would certainly be shake the mighty arsenal in the world will deter no aggressor who know that his victim be too divided to decide and too unready to respond that be the lesson that we learn from two world war yet a nation not by the action of her friend but by her own decision to prepare and plan alone could still imperil her own security by create a situation in which response would be too late and too diluted every advance in the technology of war make more unacceptable the old and narrow concept of sovereignty

 no one today can doubt the necessity of prevent war it be our firm conviction that collective action through nato be the good assurance that war will be deter in the atlantic world

 look at the atlantic community through the eye of those who in year past have yearn for conquest the sight be sober integrated command common plan force in be in advance of an emergency for use in any emergency all of these testify to a collective readiness and the integrity of collective purpose to other eye nato can only be a clear warning of the folly of aggression

 nato today therefore must be shape on the experience of the past reliance on independent action by separate force only loosely coordinate with joint force and plan twice lead to world war before 1945 but collective action have prove successful in deter war since 1945 -during 20 year of upheaval and grave danger

 we reject those experience only at our own peril

 for our part the united states of america be determined to join with 13 of her other ally to preserve and to strengthen the deterrent strength of nato we will urge that those principle of joint and common preparation be extend wherever they can be usefully apply in the atlantic alliance

 we be hopeful that no member of the treaty will long remain withdraw from the mutual affair and obligation of the atlantic a place of respect and responsibility will await any ally who decide to return to the common task

 for the world be still full of peril for those who prize and cherish liberty peril and opportunity

 these bountiful land that be wash by the atlantic this half billion people that be unmatched in arm and industry this cradle of common value and splendid vision this measureless storehouse of wealth can enrich the life of an entire planet

 it be this strength of idea as well as strength of arm of peaceful purpose as well as power that offer such hope for the reconciliation of western europe with the people of eastern europe to surrender that strength now by isolation from one another would be to dim the promise of that day when the man and woman of all europe shall again move freely among each other

 it be not a question of wealth alone

 it be a question of heart and mind it be a willingness to leave forever those national rivalry which so often lead to the useless squandering of life and treasure in war

 it be a question of the deep spirit of unity of which nato be but a symbol that unity be never well express than when at the conclusion of the north atlantic treaty in 1949 a great french leader declare that nation be more and more convinced that their fate be closely bind together that their salvation and their welfare must rest upon the progressive application of human solidarity

 and it be to the preservation of human solidarity that all of our effort today should be direct so let all of you of the foreign service institute make it your task as well as mine

 thank you and good morning

governor and mrs. morrison mayor al sorensen governor phil sorensen my dear and good friend congressman callan lady and gentleman of the great state of nebraska

 i want you to know governor morrison that i have not be able to hear much about anything since you and mayor sorensen and governor sorensen and mrs. morrison keep lady bird out here beautify for an entire day except about the glory of nebraska i be delighted to come back to omaha and to this great state to confirm all the good thing that she have say to i about you

 i have come to omaha today because i want to speak to you about the most important business in our time the business of peace in the world

 two year ago this week when i be also speak out here in the midwest i say that the peace we seek be a world where no nation fear another or no nation can force another to follow its command it be a world where difference be solve without destruction and common effort be direct at common problem

 this be still true as we meet here this afternoon i be convinced that after decade of war and threat of war peace be more within our reach than at any time in this century

 i believe this because we have make up our mind to deal with the two most common threat to peace in the world we be determined to match our resolution with action but what be these threat

 first be the desire of most people to win a well way of life that be true of you here in omaha and that be true of most people who want to win a well way of life everywhere in the world

 second be the design of a few people the design of some people to force their particular way of life on other people

 now if we ignore these threat or if we attempt to meet they only by the rhetoric of visionary intention instead of good work of determination i be certain that tyranny and not peace will be our ultimate fate

 if the strong and the wealthy turn from the need of the weak and the poor frustration be sure to be follow by force no peace and no power be strong enough to stand for long against the restless discontent of million of human being who be without any hope

 that be why we stand here this afternoon in omaha at the end of a very important lifeline at the other end of that lifeline 8,000 long mile out yonder be india india a nation of 500 million human being the wheat here this afternoon be part of their shield against the catastrophe of drought and famine

 this single load of grain will provide the margin of life for more than 2,500 family throughout the entire balance of this year but it be only a very tiny fraction of what america 's response to india 's need have be

 i would remind you that since january 1 5 million ton of american wheat have already be ship to india that be more than 2 1/2 time the annual wheat production of the state of nebraska

 and this be only about half the grain that we and other nation be provide india this year in order to help she overcome the bad drought that her people have ever suffer in the history of her nation

 and america 's job be not yet over

 here today in the center of the great food produce area anywhere on this globe we americans must face a sobering fact most of the world 's population be lose the battle to feed itself if present trend continue we can now see the point at which even our own vast productive resource include the million of acre of farmland that we now hold in reserve will not be sufficient to meet the requirement of human being for food

 in my food for freedom message that the president send to the congress i request the authority and the fund to provide food on very special term to those country that be willing to increase their own production

 we will lend america 's technical knowledge we will lend america 's practical experience to those people who need it most and who be willing to prove to we that they be willing to try to help themselves in addition to that we will support program of capital investment water development farm machinery pesticide seed research and fertilizer

 we will introduce all the american know how in their country to try to help they learn to produce the food that be necessary to satisfy the human body that live in their land

 now these be only beginning we must work for a global effort hunger know no ideology hunger know no single race or no single nationality no party democratic or republican

 we recognize the contribution of the soviet union we recognize the contribution of yugoslavia in contribute food to india we be glad that they see fit to try to do their part we welcome the support of every nation in the world when that support be give to feed hungry human being in this kind of cooperation we find the seed of unity against the common enemy of all mankind

 i long for the day when we and other whatever their political creed will turn our joint resource to the battle against poverty ignorance and disease because i honestly believe that these enemy poverty and ignorance and disease be the enemy of peace in the world

 but that day be not here because some man in some place still insist on try to force their way of life on other people

 that be the second threat that i want to talk about out here in omaha today

 that be the second threat to peace try to force their way of life on other people that be the threat that we be stand up to with our proud sailor soldier airmen and marines in south vietnam at this hour

 now i want to point out to you that the conflict there be important for many reason but i have time to mention only a few i be go to mention three specifically

 the first reason we believe that the right of other people be just as important as our own we believe that we be obligate to help those whose right be be threaten by brute force

 individual can never escape a sense of decency and respect for other neither can democratic nation if one man here in omaha unlawfully force another to do what he command then you rebel against the injustice because you know it be wrong for one man here in omaha to force another one to do what he want he to do unless human concern have disappear from all of our value you also know that it be necessary i emphasize necessary"--to help that man that be be force to defend himself

 this same principle be true for nations-- nation which live by respect of the right of other if one government use force to violate another people 's right we can not ignore the injustice the threat to our own right the danger to peace in the entire world

 that be what be happen at this hour in south vietnam the north vietnamese be try to deny the people of south vietnam the right to build their own nation the right to choose their own system of government the right to live and to work in peace

 to those people in america who say they have never have this thing explain to they i want to repeat that again

 the north vietnamese at this hour be try to deny the people of south vietnam the right to build their own nation the right to choose their own system of government the right to go and vote in a free election and select their own people the right to live and work in peace

 south vietnam have ask we for help only if we abandon our respect for the right of other people could we turn down their plea

 second south vietnam be important to the security of the rest of all of asia

 a few year ago the nation of free asia lie under the shadow of communist china they face a common threat but not in unity they be still catch up in their old dispute and dangerous confrontation they be ripe for aggression

 now that picture be change

 shield by the courage of the south vietnamese the people of free asia today be drive toward economic and social development in a new spirit of regional cooperation

 all you have to do be look at that map and you will see independence grow thriving blossoming and blooming

 they be convince that the vietnamese people and their ally be go to stand firm against the conqueror or against aggression

 our fighting in vietnam therefore be buy time not only for south vietnam but it be buy time for a new and a vital grow asia to emerge and develop additional strength

 if south vietnam be to collapse under communist pressure from the north the progress in the rest of asia would be greatly endanger and do not you forget that

 the third reason be what happen in south vietnam will determine yes it will determine whether ambitious and aggressive nation can use guerrilla warfare to conquer their weak neighbor

 it will determine whether might make right

 now i do not know of a single more important reason for our presence than this

 we be fight in south vietnam a different kind of war than we have ever know in the past

 sixteen year ago this month north korea attack south korea by armed invasion across a national border a communist country attempt to conquer and overrun its neighbor

 the united states of america recognize this kind of aggression immediately and we act north korean aggression fail why because president harry s. truman and the american people work with the force of the united nations support that great leader have the courage to help the people of south korea protect their home and protect their country

 those people be help we in vietnam now

 today south korea be still free and thousand of its young man be again fight side by side with the americans to defend another small country from be swallow up by a more powerful communist neighbor

 today in south vietnam we be witness to another kind of armed aggression

 it be a war that be wage by man who believe that subversion and guerrilla warfare transport across international boundary can achieve what conventional army could not

 they believe that in the long run a modern scientific and industrial nation such as ours be helpless to defend a small and weak country against the import terror of guerrilla warfare

 that be what be go on there the communist guerrilla the vietcong choose their target carefully they aim at the heart of a struggle nation by murder the schoolteacher by murder the agricultural extension worker by kill the health worker by assassinate the mayor and their family

 in 1965 alone the communists kill or kidnap 12,000 south vietnamese civilian that be equivalent to wipe out the entire population of columbus nebraska or alliance county or one out of every 25 citizen that live in this great city of omaha

 if by such method the agent of one nation can go out and hold and seize power where turbulent change be occur in another nation our hope for peace and order will suffer a crush blow all over the world it will be an invitation to the would be conqueror to keep on marching that be why the problem of guerrilla warfare the problem of vietnam be a very critical threat to peace not just in south vietnam but in all of this world in which we live

 let there be no doubt about it those who say this be merely a south vietnamese civil war could not be more wrong the warfare in south vietnam be start by the government of north vietnam in 1959

 it be finance it be support by an increase flow of man and arm from the north into the south

 it be direct and it be lead by a skilled professional staff of north vietnamese and it be support by a very small minority of the population of south vietnam

 the military tactic be different the nature of the fighting be different but the objective be the same as we find it in korea the objective be what the objective be to conquer an independent nation by the force and power of arm might make right so think these communist invader

 well the war take a new turn in 1964 the north vietnamese decide to step up the conflict in the hope of an early victory they recruit and draft more young man from the communist area in the south

 they slip across the border of south vietnam more than three division of the north vietnamese regular army today there be more than three north vietnamese division fight in south vietnam

 they build all weather road the trail turn into boulevard to replace the jungle trail that they have once use

 they begin send troop in by truck rather than on foot

 they shift over to heavy weapon use import ammunition most of it come from communist china

 by any definition you want to use any definition any lawyer can tell you this this be armed aggression the philosophy that might make right

 well america 's purpose be to convince north vietnam that this kind of aggression be too costly that this kind of power can not succeed

 we have learn from their prisoner their defector and their capture document that the hanoi government really think a few month ago that conquest be in its grasp but the free man have rally to prevent this conquest from succeed

 in the past 15 month our action and those of our fight ally of korea australia new zealand and the philippines and the courage of the people of south vietnam have already begin to turn the tide

 the casualty of the vietcong and the north vietnamese force be three time large than those of the south vietnamese and their ally

 battle after battle be be win by the south vietnamese and by the troop under that gallant leader from the united states of america general westy westmoreland he be get some military advice on the side from some of our armchair general in the united states but it look to i like he be do pretty good use his own judgment

 the air attack on military target in north vietnam have impose and will continue to impose a grow burden and a high price on those who wage war against the freedom of their neighbor

 in the south the vietnamese be determined that their own economic development their own social reform and political progress can not wait until the war end so they be now move toward constitutional government

 for the past 2 month the political struggle in south vietnam have be dramatize in our newspaper they have be publish on our television screen every day

 but all during this time the vietnamese citizen represent every important group in the society have be quietly meet in orderly assembly they have formulate rule for their election the rule have be accept with only minor modification by the government in saigon

 and in the province and village the vietnamese have go on build school for their child improve health facility and agricultural method and take the first step toward land reform

 so we can take heart from all of this we be back the vietnamese not only in their determination to save their country we be support their determination to build to construct a modern society in which the government will be their government reflect the will of the people of south vietnam

 our objective in vietnam be not war our objective be peace

 there be nothing that we want in north vietnam there be nothing we want from north vietnam

 there be nothing that we want in communist china there be nothing the american people want from communist china

 we have make it very clear by every mean at our disposal that we wish the killing to stop

 we have make it very clear that we wish negotiation to begin on the basis of international agreement make in 1954 and 1962

 for 37 long day we halt bombing in the north in the hope that the government in hanoi would signal its willingness to talk instead of fight but i regret to tell you that no signal come during those 37 day

 in many more way than i can now tell you here in omaha we have explore and we be continue to explore avenue to peace with north vietnam

 but as of this moment their only reply have be to send more troop and to send more gun into the south

 until the day they decide to end this aggression and to make an honorable peace i can assure you that we speak for the united states of america intend to carry on

 no one know how long it will take only hanoi can be the judge of that no one can tell you how much effort it will take none can tell you how much sacrifice it will take no one can tell you how costly it will be

 but i can and i do here and now tell you this the aggression that they be conduct will not succeed the people of south vietnam will be give the chance to work out their own destiny in their own way and not at the point of a bayonet or with a gun at their temple

 i hear my friend say i be troubled i be confused i be frustrate and all of we can understand those people sometimes i almost develop a stomach ulcer myself just listen to they

 we all wish the war would end we all wish the troop would come home but i want to see the alternative and the calculation that they have to present that give they a well chance to get the troop home than the very thing we be do

 there be no human being in all this world who wish these thing to happen for peace to come to the world more than your president of the united states

 if you be too busy or not inclined to help please count 10 before you hurt because we must have no doubt today about the determination of the american man wear american uniform the marines who be out there fight in the wet jungle wade through the rice paddy up to their belt the sailor who be search the shore and patrol the sea the airman who be out there face the missile and the antiaircraft gun carry out their mission try to protect your liberty the least they be entitle to be for you to be as brave as they be and to stand up and give they the support they need here at home

 these man be not go to fail we

 now the real question be be we go to fail they our staying power be what count in the long and dangerous month ahead

 the communists expect we to lose heart

 the communists expect to wear we down the communists expect to divide this nation

 the communists be not happy about the military defeat they be take in south vietnam

 but sometimes they do get encourage as they say this week about the dissension in the united states of america they believe that the political disagreement in washington the confusion and doubt in the united states will hand they a victory on a silver platter in southeast asia

 well if they think that they be wrong to those who would try to pressure we or influence we mislead we or deceive we i say this afternoon there can be only one decision in vietnam and that be this we will see this through we shall persist we shall succeed

 other president have make the commitment i have reaffirm it the congress have confirm it i plan to do all that i can in my own limited way to see that we not permit 14 million innocent man woman and child to fall victim to a savage aggression

 there be many nation large and small whose security depend on the reliability of the word and the reliability of the power of the united states the word of the united states must remain a trust that man can live by can live with and can depend upon

 some day we will all work as friend and neighbor to grow more food to build more school to heal the sick to care for the old to encourage the young

 we have program in that direction in the united states go on now and we be not go to junk they but we be not go to tuck our tail and run out of south vietnam either

 history be not make by nameless force history be make by man and woman by their government and their nation

 this nation work with other must demonstrate in vietnam that our commitment to freedom and peace be not a fragile thing it can and it will sustain the major test and any test that may confront it

 with your support with your faith we will fulfill america 's duty

 we have a proud and a glorious heritage we be go to be true to it

 it be only 20 month ago that the people of america hold a great national election the people of 44 state of this union include the great state of nebraska give i a direction and vote i a majority for the presidency of this country i believe that their vote be a trust that as long as i hold this high and most responsible office and gift of the american people that i would do my good as president of the country as commander in chief of the army

 now there be many many who can recommend advise and sometimes a few of they consent but there be only one that have be choose by the american people to decide

 with your support with your prayer with your faith i intend to honor the responsibility and to be true to the trust of the office to which you elect i and to preserve freedom in this country to keep our commitment to honor our treaty and let the rest of the world know that when america give its word america keep its word

 he have high praise for the people and the leader of the dominican republic for their perseverance and faith during the past year of this great crisis he say the recent election represent not only a respect for constitutional government but the desire of the dominican people for peace and tranquility

 i ask the vice president to discuss with dr. balaguer the economic assistance which the united states have be provide the dominican republic in the past and to analyze the future need of that economy dr. balaguer and his government face staggering problem

 i think you would be interested in know that approximately 25 percent of the work force in the dominican republic be presently unemployed

 the vice president report that the dominican government be move to face these problem forcefully and he believe effectively

 i will discuss the vice president 's report with secretary rusk and other official to make certain we be do everything we can to assist the courageous people of the dominican republic mr. rostow be already analyze and evaluate the vice president 's report and will have recommendation for i when he arrive tomorrow

 they seem determined to make constitutional government work in the dominican republic and to improve the well being of every citizen i know that all americans wish they well

 i have today receive from secretary mcnamara an appraisal of the efficiency of the buildup of the united states force in vietnam i be pleased as his report indicate that he will attempt to reduce the plan rate of production substantially 90 to 180 day from now

 in the report to the president by secretary mcnamara he say

 approximately 1 year ago the buildup of our force in vietnam be initiate at your direction i believe it be timely he say to report to you the result of that action

 first i would point out that never before in our history have it be possible to accomplish such a rapid and such an effective expansion of our armed forces without the need to mobilize the reserve force and to call up the reserve to impose stringent economic control and emergency control on our economy or to require involuntary extension of active duty throughout the service

 as commander in chief you have reason to be proud of the magnificent professional leadership which our man in vietnam be receive from general william c. westmoreland his officer and his noncommissioned officer and man this matchless leadership be parallel by the fact that no military force have be so well supply

 despite the fact that we deploy a military force of more than 100,000 man within 120 day and send they halfway around the world we have be able to keep that force constantly supply and equip so that at all time they have be capable of bring to bear their full power against the aggressor

 as general earle g. wheeler chairman of the joint chiefs of staff have report

 there have be no shortage in supply for the troop in vietnam which have adversely affect combat operation or the health or welfare of our troop no required air sortie have be cancel as a matter of fact the air support give our force be without parallel in our history

 with ample inventory stock still on hand our production of ammunition and air ordnance this month will exceed our consumption this month

 indeed say secretary mcnamara i believe it may very well prove desirable to reduce planned rate of production substantially such action would be in keep with your insistence that the department of defense make certain that all military requirement be fulfil while achieve this objective with maximum economy for our taxpayer by continue to carefully adjust expenditure and production and by resist the temptation to ask for more money and to spend more money than we need i believe say the secretary we can avoid the carryover that be represent by $ 12 billion of surplus and worthless materiel with which we conclude the korean war

 our buildup have be responsive it have be forceful and it have be effective

 just one brief note in conclusion while final figure on the receipt and expenditure for fiscal 1966 which end june 30th be not yet available it be very clear to i this morning after a conference with the chairman of the president 's economic advisers and the director of the bureau of the budget that the administrative budget deficit for this year will be very substantially below the $ 5.3 billion originally estimate in january 1965 and far below the $ 6.4 billion forecast this past january

 this mark the third straight year in which the actual deficit have be low than what the president predict in fiscal 1964 the actual deficit be $ 3.7 billion below what the president promise the congress in his estimate in 1965 it be $ 1 1/2 billion below what the president have recommend in his estimate

 we will not know the final 1966 figure for several week but it be already clear that the reduction in the deficit below our original estimate of 18 month ago will be great than we achieve in 1965

 in the 10 year prior to fiscal 1964 the actual budget outcome average $ 2.9 billion bad than the original predict figure

 i believe the fiscal outcome for the past year and for the previous year for which i be responsible demonstrate three thing

 first we have try to make a realistic estimate of both our revenue and expenditure and to be conservative and careful in those estimate

 second we have make an unremitting effort to hold our expenditure wherever possible at or below our initial estimate

 i be proud to tell you that i believe that will be do so far as domestic expenditure be concern this year by several hundred million of dollar

 third we have maintain the strength and health of our economy so that revenue each year have exceed our estimate for that year which the budget director tell i be somewhat unusual

 we be determined to maintain a sound and a healthy economy which will provide the revenue that we will need to meet our responsibility in the year ahead

 now i will be glad to take your question if you have any

 q. mr. president go back to the subject of vietnam what have be the effect of our intensify airstrike on military target in north vietnam what have be the effect on their rate of infiltration in other word what have be the noticeable result since we start hit the oil tank

 the president the evaluation that we have and they be still come in we have new picture that be be analyze at this moment the evaluation that we have indicate that about 86 percent of the know petroleum storage capacity in north vietnam be hit the other evening in a very accurate target operation over the pol target in the vicinity of hanoi and haiphong

 the late estimate of the storage capacity actually destroy that have come in from the field be 57 percent

 in other word 86 percent of the storage be hit 57 percent they estimate be destroy

 i can not embrace those figure because the picture be not complete but the general officer who have review this tell i this morning that they think both estimate be within reason and they think it be a very successful operation

 i think that every general officer carry responsibility either in vietnam or in the pentagon as well as most of our career experienced diplomatic observer think that this action at this time be require by the event of the time

 q. mr. president last saturday you order an exhaustive review of the selective service.3 on the basis of your conversation with your adviser congressmen and what you have hear from the general public what be your appraisal of the defect and shortcoming of the military draft as it be now administer

 the president we have develop the good system that we have know how to in the light of our experience

 we have ask the pentagon to review it from their standpoint and they have do so they be now present their view to the appropriate committee in the congress

 i have ask some of our most distinguished citizen mr. burke marshall former assistant attorney general mr. thomas gates former secretary of defense under general eisenhower mrs. oveta culp hobby former director of the wacs and a cabinet officer under general eisenhower and some of the good talent in this nation to review all the alternative available to a country which find it necessary to draft its young man

 i do not want to prejudge that study that study be in the process of be make we will have a very competent staff we expect to have some conclusion and some recommendation to present to the next session of congress in ample time for they to carefully consider before the present draft law expire

 q. mr. president in view of your statement at the beginning of the news conference in which you talk about the successful military buildup and also about the fact that we may be able to cut back some of our military production would it be accurate for we mr. president to analyze this as indicate that the major part of the buildup have now be accomplish in vietnam

 the president no i would not make such an evaluation

 i would say so far as ammunition be concern the secretary hope that within 90 to 180 day he can make some recommendation i think it be his feeling that those recommendation that he will make which will have the support of the joint chiefs of staff will result in the saving of several hundred of million of dollar over what the cost would be at the present rate

 that be not to indicate though that we will not call up additional man that we will not train additional man that we will not procure additional plane that we will not procure additional helicopter that we will not send additional people overseas because we will do all of those thing

 but we be watch it very carefully so we will not have a $ 12 billion holdover at the end of the difficulty in vietnam

 q. mr. president could you assess the prospect now for democracy and for continue economic and social growth in latin america in view of the military takeover in argentina and prior to that in brazil

 the president yes we regret the action that take place in argentina recently we have have similar action of that type in the last year two or three instance they be less in the last few month than they have be heretofore

 we be very encouraged by what have happen generally in latin america we be very proud of our record of growth there

 we be spend about a billion dollar or a little in excess of a billion dollar in our alliance for progress program in latin america

 we find the per capita growth rate have jump from 1 percent to in excess of 2 1/2 percent that already equal and exceed the goal that we have set for the alliance for progress

 notwithstanding the grave prediction make and the discouragement that the dominican people receive from many quarter they have have a peaceful election a majority of the people have exercise their democratic right to select a government of their own choosing

 they have select that government

 they have just finish a similar exercise in guatemala and some four or five additional latin american nation

 we would say as we look around the world at this hemisphere latin america the prosperity the democratic evolution that be take place when we look over africa look over southeast asia generally with the exception of our problem in vietnam when we take a look at the middle east and western europe we have much to be thankful for generally speak much to be encourage about

 now i find that true and that to be the judgment of most of our experienced career diplomat

 we think that on practically every continent when you look back at africa just a few month ago at the serious problem we have in the congo and so forth you look at the dominican republic the panama situation the difficulty we have in brazil the problem in chile we have make great progress and generally speak we be optimistic about most of the continent

 if we could only solve the problem in vietnam and we think we be on the way to do that we could have a world that be rather peaceful and generally prosperous

 q. mr. president survey of every kind be be conduct about you some of they recently show a drop in your performance rating today the harris poll give you high point for your vietnam action last week a newspaper poll in california say that the california democrats prefer senator robert kennedy over you two to one

 how much be you influence by these poll

 the president well i think we all read they and be affect by they

 we of course would like for every poll to be of our liking we like to feel that all of they be accurate we have have a dozen poll i guess in the last week

 you do not read about the favorable one though i have observe

 mr. gallup report last week that we have gain 4 percent mr. harris report today that we have about 55 percent of the total in the country mr. quayle have make a nationwide survey and he show about 55 percent

 now that be what you report as a landslide during general eisenhower 's period

 our poll in california show a very healthy majority for approval of our record we believe that it will show the same thing in iowa

 those be the only two poll that you have cite

 we have a number of they that come to we each day if you be interested in they i will see that mr. moyers make they available to you

 maine show 57 43 percent that be unusual for a democratic administration

 new hampshire 53 47 new jersey 7624 michigan 62 38 although governor romney have a substantial majority of the democrats favor his record as governor we lead governor romney in his own state

 in tennessee it be 61 39 that be considerably well than we be in 1964 virginia be 53 47 texas 58 42

 we have a good many poll from all over the country they be not disturbing to we we think that a 55 percent rating in the country that be the landslide that general eisenhower defeat mr. adlai stevenson by so we be not upset

 we would all like to have as much approval as we can get but we have to make our judgment and do what we think be right then we trust the judgment of the people at election time i have not the slight doubt but what they will exercise good judgment

 q. mr. president there have be many favorable comment lately in the press by military leader on vietnam could you give we your assessment of the situation as it be today

 the president i think our boy under general westmoreland his staff officer and the man they be lead be do an exceptionally fine job i want to encourage they in every way i can i want to support they in every way i can

 i be fearful that sometimes we do not give enough thought to those man as we sit here in the luxury of our front porch and our lawn that we do not recognize the man that be die for we out in the rice paddy

 i do not think you can speak too well of they their record have be outstanding their result be very good

 our diplomatic report indicate that the oppose force no long really expect a military victory in south vietnam

 i be aware of the danger of speculation you do not pay i anything extra for it so i be not go to guess for you

 suffice it to say i be proud of what the man be do if everyone in this country be work as hard to support the principle of democracy as the man in vietnam be i think we would have little to worry about

 q. mr. president can you tell we anything about the public reaction as reflect in the telegram and letter to you on your decision to bomb the haiphong and hanoi oil field

 the president yes

 first of all all the communist country generally speak oppose it rather vehemently some of they be rather vicious in their statement and i think inaccurate that we be bomb civilian target and kill civilian

 we be very careful to select military target that be not in the center of the area and to spare all civilian we take every precaution available to we

 i can not understand the thinking of any country or any people or any person that say we should sit by with our hand tie behind we while these man bring their mortar their hand grenade and their bomb into our barrack and kill our marines attack our camp murder the village chief and that we should not do anything about it

 now we have try to make this difficult for they to continue at their present rate we do not say it will stop the infiltration we do not say that it will even reduce it

 but we do think it will make it more difficult for they and we do think it will require they to assign additional people we do think it will give they problem

 we have have a policy of measured response and gradually increase our strength from time to time we plan to continue that

 most of the communist country express disapproval most of the country in the area involve and all of the country who have body there who have man in uniform there approve our action

 it be difficult for i to understand the response of some nation that be not involve when a few year ago when their own security be at stake they need american man and they want we to furnish american troop not to be understanding of what we be try to do to help other maintain their independence now

 i would say that we have very encouraging report from a good many of our ally we be disappoint in a few we expect the regular communist response namely that this would harden the opposition and that it would not lead to negotiation that we be kill civilian and that we be not bomb military target

 but all those thing we consider in advance and we think we pursue the right course

 since you be talk about poll i be inform today that the national poll show that 85 percent of the people of this country approve this position i think we do the right thing at the right time i hope that we can continue to be as successful in the day ahead in connection with general westmoreland 's operation as we be in this particular exercise

 q. mr. president regard racial incident sir in various city what be your estimate of the immediate hazard in the situation and do you have any advice for americans in this connection

 the president yes we be try in every way we can to find employment for the unemployed in our city we be try in every way we can to get people to quit practice discrimination in our city we be try to meet the poverty situation as we find it with the limited resource at our command

 we be not interested in black power and we be not interested in white power but we be interested in american democratic power with a small d. we believe that the citizen ought to be arm with the power to vote we believe the citizen regardless of his race or his religion or color ought to be arm with the right to have a job at decent wage

 we believe that every citizen ought to have the right to have a decent home we be do everything we can as quickly as we can under our voter right bill under our civil right bill under our housing bill under proposal we have make in cooperation with the mayor under the able leadership of the vice president to improve these terrible condition that exist in the ghetto of this country

 now we can not do it all overnight we be much too late but we have do more in the last 24 month than have be do in any similar 24 year period to face up to these condition of health education poverty and discrimination

 we be go to continue as long as i be president to do everything we can to see that all citizen be treat equally and have equal opportunity when we achieve that i think we will find a good deal of the solution to the problem which you mention

 q. mr. president a paris magazine a french magazine report that ho chi minh tell red china and the soviet union if they do not give more help he would have to come to term with we next year have you anything on that

 the president i have not read the paris magazine

 q. mr. president how do you assess the chance now for a treaty ban the spread of nuclear weapon do your decision to bomb close to hanoi and halphong in any way jeopardize that

 the president no we do not think so we be do everything we can to reach an agreement on such a treaty we be very anxious to do it we hope the soviet union will meet we and find an acceptable compromise in language which we can both live with

 they have some problem at the moment but we be go to live up to the test ban treaty religiously and scrupulously follow it we be go to do everything within the power of our most imaginative people to find language which will bring the nuclear power together in a treaty which will provide nonproliferation we think it be one of the most important decision of our time and we be go to do everything to bring people together on it

 q. sir in light of these recently publish poll can you give we your thinking now about run again in 1968

 the president no i think you will see a good deal of i this year i have be in about 10 state in the last several week i expect to get around the country and talk to the people about our problem and our program

 but i have no announcement to make about my own future except to say i be go to do my dead level good to serve all the people of this country

 q. mr. president in light of the upcoming election do you plan to do much travel between now and november

 the president we have a legislative program yet to be act on we have more than half of it already enact we have about 85 percent of it enact last year we hope to get a substantial part of it complete in the next few month

 as time permit i will be travel throughout the country i have be in the states of new york illinois texas nebraska virginia maryland iowa and new jersey all in the last 3 or 4 week at that rate we could cover all 50 of they between now and say late october

 thank you mr. president





lady and gentleman
 i want very much to be in west virginia tonight to speak to the american alumni council what the weather have prevent however the miracle of electronic have make possible
 i be happy to be speak to you tonight from here in the white house in a very special way this be really your house
 i have great respect for the work that you do my own career owe a large debt to man and woman like you who have make it possible for the young people of our country to learn
 i know what alumnus mean to the support of high education last year alumnus contribute almost $ 300 million to the college and university of this nation as the father of two daughter and as the president of a country in which more than half of our citizen be now under 25 year of age i think i know how important that assistance be to the youth of this nation
 throughout my entire life i have take seriously the warning that the world be engage in a race between education and chaos for the last 2 1/2 year i have live here with the daily awareness that the fate of mankind really depend on the outcome of that race
 so i come here tonight because you be commit in the name of education to help we decide that contest and that be the most important victory we can ever win
 we have set out in this country to improve the quality of all american life we be concern with each man 's opportunity to develop his talent we be concern with his environment the city and the farm where he live the air he breathe the water he drink we seek to enrich the school that educate he and of course to improve the government that serve he
 we be at war against the poverty that deprive he the unemployment that degrade he and the prejudice that defy he
 as we look at other part of the world we see similar battle be fight in asia in africa and in latin america on every hand we see the thirst for independence the struggle for progress the almost frantic race that be take place between education on the one hand and disaster on the other
 in all these region we too have a very big stake
 and nowhere be the stake high than asia so i want to talk to you tonight about asia and about peace in asia
 asia be now the crucial arena of man 's strive for independence and order and for life itself
 this be true because three out of every five people in all this world live in asia tonight this be true because hundred of million of they exist on less than 25 cent a day
 and this be true because communists in tonight still believe in force in order achieve their communist goal
 so if endure peace can ever come to asia all mankind will benefit but if peace fail there nowhere else will our achievement really be secure
 by peace in asia i do not mean simply the absence of armed hostility for wherever man hunger and hate there can really be no peace
 i do not mean the peace of conquest for humiliation can be the seedbe of war
 i do not mean simply the peace of the conference table for peace be not really write merely in the word of treaty but peace be the day by day work of builder
 so the peace we seek in asia be a peace of conciliation between communist state and their non communist neighbor between rich nation and poor between small nation and large between man whose skin be brown and black and yellow and white between hindus and moslems and buddhists and christians
 it be a peace that can only be sustain through the durable bond of peace and through international trade and through the free flow of people and idea and through full participation by all nation in an international community under law and through a common dedication to the great task of human progress and economic development
 be such a peace possible
 with all my heart i believe that it be we be not there yet we have a long way to journey but the foundation for such a peace in asia be be lay tonight as never before they must be build on these essential
 first be the determination of the united states to meet our obligation in asia as a pacific power
 you have hear argument the other way they be build on the old belief that east be east and west be west and never the twain shall meet
 -that we have no business but business interest in asia
 -that europe not the far east be really our proper sphere of interest
 -that our commitment in asia be not worth the resource that they require
 -that the ocean be vast the culture alien the language strange and the race different
 -that these really be not our kind of people
 but all of these argument have be thoroughly test and all of they i think have really be find want
 they do not stand the test of geography because we be bound not by one but by two ocean and whether by aircraft or ship by satellite or missile the pacific be as crossable as the atlantic
 they do not stand the test of common sense the economic network of this shrink globe be too intertwine the basic hope of man be too interrelated the possibility of common disaster be too real for we to ever ignore threat to peace in asia
 they do not stand the test of human concern either the people of asia do matter we share with they many thing in common we be all person we be all human being
 and they do not stand the test of reality either asia be no long sit outside the door of the 20th century she be here in the same world with all of we to be either our partner or our problem
 americans enter this century believe that our own security have no foundation outside our own continent twice we mistook our sheltered position for safety twice we be dead wrong
 and if we be wise now we will not repeat our mistake of the past we will not retreat from the obligation of freedom and security in asia
 the second essential for peace in asia be this to prove to aggressive nation that the use of force to conquer other be really a lose game
 there be no more difficult task really in a world of revolutionary change where the reward of conquest tempt ambitious appetite
 as long as the leader of north vietnam really believe that they can take over the people of south vietnam by force we just must not let they succeed
 we must stand across their path and say you will not prevail but turn from the use of force and peace will follow
 every american must know exactly what it be that we be try to do in vietnam our great resource really in this conflict our great support for the man who be fight out there be your understanding it be your willingness to carry perhaps for a long time the heavy burden of a confusing and costly war
 we be not try to wipe out north vietnam
 we be not try to change their government
 we be not try to establish permanent basis in south vietnam
 and we be not try to gain one inch of new territory for america
 then you say why be we there why
 well we be there because we be try to make the communists of north vietnam stop shoot at their neighbor
 -because we be try to make this communist aggression unprofitable
 -because we be try to demonstrate that guerrilla warfare inspire by one nation against another nation just can never succeed once that lesson be learn a shadow that hang over all of asia tonight will i think begin to recede
 well you say when will that day come i be sorry i can not tell you only the man in hanoi can give you that answer
 we be fight a war of determination it may last a long time but we must keep on until the communists in north vietnam realize the price of aggression be too high and either agree to a peaceful settlement or to stop their fighting
 however long it take i want the communists in hanoi to know where we stand
 first victory for your army be impossible you can not drive we from south vietnam by your force do not mistake our firm stand for false optimism as long as you persist in aggression we be go to resist
 second the minute you realize that a military victory be out of the question and you turn from the use of force you will find we ready and willing to reciprocate we want to end the fighting we want to bring our man back home we want an honorable peace in vietnam in your hand be the key to that peace you have only to turn it
 the third essential be the building of political and economic strength among the nation of free asia
 for year they have be work at that task and the untold story of 1966 be the story of what free asians have do for themselves and with the help of other while south vietnam and her ally have be busy hold aggression at bay
 many of you can recall our faith in the future of europe at the end of world war ii when we begin the marshall plan we back that faith with all the aid and compassion we could muster
 well our faith in asia tonight be just as great and that faith be back by judgment and by reason for if we stand firm in vietnam against military conquest we truly believe that the emerge order of hope and progress in asia will continue to grow and to grow
 our very able secretary of state dean rusk have just return from a trip through the far east he tell i yesterday afternoon of many of the hearten sign he see as the people of asia continue to work toward common goal and these be just some of they
 in the last year
 -japan and korea have settle their long stand dispute and establish normal relation with promise for a close cooperation
 -one country after another have achieve rate of economic growth that be far beyond the most optimistic hope we have a few year ago
 -indonesia and its more than 100 million people have already pull back from the brink of communism and economic collapse
 -our friend in india and pakistan-600 million strong have end a tragic conflict and have return to the immense work of peace
 -japan have become a dramatic example of economic progress through political and social freedom and have begin to help other
 -communist china 's policy of aggression by proxy be fail
 -nine pacific nation ally and neutral white and color come together on their own initiative to form an asian and pacific council
 -new and constructive grouping for economic cooperation be under discussion in southeast asia
 -the billion dollar asian development bank which i first mention in baltimore in my televise speech a few month ago be already move forward in manila with the participation of more than 31 nation
 -and the development of the lower mekong river basin be go forward despite the war
 throughout free asia you can hear the echo of progress as one malaysian leader say whatever our ethical cultural or religious background the nation and people of southeast asia must pull together in the same broad sweep of history we must create with our own hand and mind a new perspective and a new framework and we must do it ourselves
 for this be the new asia and this be the new spirit we see take shape behind our defense of south vietnam because we have be firm because we have commit ourselves to the defense of one small country other country have take new heart
 and i want to assure they tonight that we never intend to let you down america 's word will always be good
 there be a fourth essential for peace in asia which may seem the most difficult of all reconciliation between nation that now call themselves enemy
 a peaceful mainland china be central to a peaceful asia
 a hostile china must be discourage from aggression
 a misguided china must be encourage toward understanding of the outside world and toward policy of peaceful cooperation
 for last peace can never come to asia as long as the 700 million people of mainland china be isolate by their ruler from the outside world
 we have learn in our relation with other such state that the weakness of neighbor be a temptation and only firmness that be back by power can really deter power that be back by ambition but we have also learn that the great force for open closed mind and open closed society be the free flow of idea and people and good
 for many year now the united states have attempt in vain to persuade the chinese communists to agree to an exchange of newsmen as one of the first step to increase understanding between our people
 more recently we have take step to permit american scholar expert in medicine and public health and other specialist to travel to communist china and only today we here in the government clear a passport for a leading american businessman to exchange knowledge with chinese mainland leader in red china
 all of these initiative except the action today have be reject by communist china
 we persist because we know that hunger and disease ignorance and poverty recognize no boundary of either creed or class or country
 we persist because we believe that even the most rigid society will some day one day awaken to the rich possibility of a diverse world
 and we continue because we believe that cooperation not hostility be really the way of the future in the 20th century
 that day be not yet here it may be long in come but i tell you it be clearly on its way because come it must
 early this year the foreign minister of singapore say that if the nation of the world could learn to build a truly world civilization in the pacific through cooperation and peaceful competition then as our great president theodore roosevelt once remark this may be the great of all human era the pacific era
 as a pacific power we must help achieve that outcome
 because it be a goal that be worthy of our american dream and it be a goal that be worthy of the deed of our brave man who be die for we tonight
 so i say to you and i pledge to all those who be count on we you can depend upon we because all americans will do our part

frank cormier associated press mr. president what be your reaction to the talk from hanoi about possible war crime trial for american prisoner and what might be the consequence of such an action

 the president we feel very strongly frank that these man who be military man who be carry out military assignment in line of duty against military target be not war criminal and should not be treat as such

 we be ready whenever the hanoi government be ready to sit down at a conference table under the sponsorship of the international committee of the red cross to discuss way in which the geneva conventions of 1949 can be give full and more complete application in vietnam

 we think that the thought that these american boy have commit war crime be deplorable and repulsive your government have take every step that it consider appropriate to see that proper representation on this subject have be make

 merriman smith united press international mr. president again in connection with the war in vietnam there be a recurrence of request or recommendation that the united states again halt the bombing of north vietnam these request have come from everybody from the indian prime minister to faction in this country what be your reaction to this sort of urge

 my close representative be ready and willing and anxious at any time to enter into those discussion

 i do not think that we should spend all of our time though examine what the government of the united states might be willing to do without any regard to what the enemy might be willing to do

 we have state again and again our desire to engage in unconditional discussion and i repeat they again today

 but we can not talk about just half the war we should talk about all the war and we have not the slight indication that the other side be willing to make any concession to take any action that would lead to the peace table

 and until there be some indication on their part we of course would not expect to tie the hand of our man in vietnam

 garnett homer washington evening star mr. president do you contemplate any further action in the airline strike

 the president yes secretary wirtz have make a statement a rather strong statement within the hour in connection with that controversy the president have follow the law we have take every legal step that we could we appoint and convene a very fair and judicious board of distinguished americans who hear testimony that run into the hundred of page make proper recommendation and draw appropriate conclusion and submit they to the president

 my adviser examine those recommendation and i as president of this country urge both labor and management to follow the board 's recommendation

 the board recommend that the airline pay approximately an additional $ 76 million in increase wage and benefit

 after some consideration the management agree to the board 's recommendation but the union representative refuse

 we have no legal remedy leave to we in the government we have do all we can do under the law we be continue to persuade the management and labor people to continue their discussion we be hopeful that they will continue those discussion and work around the clock because the people of this country deserve to be serve

 while we have no law that can force the man to go back to work i think the patience of the american people be be try and although the government have do everything it can do to keep the mail move to serve the need of defense the time have come when a settlement be indicate we would hope that the party would continue to bargain until a decision be reach

 j. f. ter horst detroit news mr. president would it be possible or have any thought be give to the idea of a prisoner exchange with hanoi

 but we have receive no response whatever that would indicate the willingness on the part of the other side to do this

 john steele time magazine mr. president your ambassador to the united nations and several other administration spokesman have issue rather somber warning about the course of the war in the event the prisoner be bring to trial i wonder if you would care to inform we now what action you might desire to take in the event that the trial do take place

 the president i would not want to go far on that john than i have go i think the people of this country and the peaceful people of the world would find this action very revolting and repulsive and would react accordingly

 edward p. morgan abc news mr. president two relate question on vietnam sir member of your administration in the past have say in effect that we be not seek a military solution to the problem of vietnam but it have be widely interpret that your omaha and des moines speech change that be that true

 secondly what do you feel about the theory that every major military conflict have a point of no return and when that be reach it be difficult if not impossible to control

 the president well the answer to your first question be no the omaha and des moines speech do not change the consistent policy of this country that we have follow ever since i become president

 second i think that the important thing for all of we to remember be that we be ready and willing now and have be without any limitation whatever to discuss any subject with the enemy at any time that he be willing to discuss it but ed until he give some indication that he will sit down and talk i see nothing to be gain from these exploratory excursion

 marianne means king feature syndicate mr. president do you believe that such development as the black power slogan and the disturbance in chicago and cleveland have create a new antagonism among white that might hurt the civil right movement

 the president i be very concerned about the condition that exist in many of the large city of this country during this summer i have talk to the governors on that subject this morning and i have be in touch with a number of the mayor in most recent day

 as i say in the previous press conference i be not interested in black power or white power what i be concern with be democratic power with a small d.

 i believe that if we be not to lose a great many of the gain that we have make in recent year in treat people equally in this country give they equality in opportunity equality in education and equality in employment then we must recognize that while there be a negro minority of 10 percent in this country there be a majority of 90 percent who be not negroes

 but i believe most of those 90 percent have come around to the viewpoint of want to see equality and justice give their fellow citizen

 now they want to see it do under the law and they want to see it do orderly they want to see it do without violence i hope that the lawfully constituted authority of this country as well as every citizen of this country will obey the law will not resort to violence will do everything they can to cooperate with constitute authority to see that the evil condition be remedie that equality be give and that progress be make and i shah do everything within my power to see that that be do

 sid davis westinghouse broadcasting mr. president do the administration have any information that the current wave of riot be the work of professional agitator who want to foment trouble in our major city

 the president wherever there be trouble there be always individual to whom suspicion be attach but i would not want to say that the protest and the demonstration be inspire by foreign foe i do say that on occasion where you find this trouble you also find people who do not approve of our system and who in some instance contribute to the violence that occur

 peter lisagor chicago daily news in your speech last week you suggest a conciliatory attitude toward mainland china under certain condition do you have in mind an administration initiative that would lead toward a two china policy in the united nations or be the administration attitude toward communist chinese admission to the united nations the same as it have be

 the president it be the same as it be in my speech i spell it out in somewhat substantial detail in that speech i feel that we should do everything we can to increase our exchange to understand other people well to have our scientist and our businessman our author and our newspaper people exchange visit and exchange viewpoint

 i would hope that as a result of tear down these harrier that some day all people in this world would be willing to be guide by the principle of the charter of the united nations that all people would want to cease aggression and would try to live in peace and understanding with their neighbor

 so far as i be concern every day i be look for new way to understand the viewpoint of other and i hope that at a not too distant date mainland china will be willing to open some of the barrier to these exchange and be willing to perhaps come near to abide by the principle lay down in the united nations charter

 forrest boyd mutual broadcasting system mr. president to carry the discussion of vietnam one step far the saigon government have say i believe last night that the bombing of north vietnam would stop immediately and ally force would be ask to withdraw from south vietnam if hanoi would meet certain condition include stop fighting and withdraw their force

 do you agree with this be this in line with our policy

 the president i have not examine that statement carefully i hear it report and i read a ticker item on it

 i look with favor upon the general suggestion make there be nothing that we would welcome more than for hanoi to be willing to stop its infiltration and stop try to gobble up its neighbor to permit those people to engage in self determination and select their own government we generally approve of the sentiment express in the saigon statement as i interpret it

 raymond l. scherer nbc news two old timer in congress go down in the virginia primary what do you see as the political significance of this

 the president i do not attach any particular significance to the defeat of a member of the house or the senate

 in this instance i think it be a question of the people of the state be rather evenly divide in connection with the senate race and that frequently happen under our democratic system

 i know of no unusual significance that i would attach to it i think each year you will see some of the candidate win and some lose

 robert pierpoint cbs news under what condition mr. president would the administration consider reduce its trade barrier against communist china

 the president i think until we can have more understanding of what china 's plan be and china 's hope be and what china expect to do in her own way in the future we would not want to determine our complete course of conduct

 i think we have try to lead the way by ask they to accept as visitor some of our people some of our businessman and to discuss these problem with they

 we fervently hope as i have say again and again and again that all nation in the world will give up their thought of aggression and force and will be willing to abide by the principle of the united nations charter

 now until we see some evidence of the willingness of the various country that may be involve to do that i would not want to pass judgment on what our action might be we be hope we be work to the end that all nation embrace those principle

 ted knap scripps howard mr. president recall your state of the union promise to seek legislation to deal with strike that threaten irreparable damage to the national interest do you still plan to ask for such legislation and might this include compulsory arbitration in something like the airline strike

 i must frankly say to you that up to this point we have be unsuccessful in get legislation that the secretary of labor and the other member of my cabinet feel acceptable and that we feel would have any chance of passage in the congress

 the administration think that would be helpful the congress do not desire to act at that time

 they pass a resolution call upon the federal reserve board to take action in the matter the secretary of the treasury go back to a committee of the congress and be work with they now i discuss that subject last night he hope that we can obtain action through the banking and currency committee of the house on legislation that will be helpful

 we be seriously concern with the plight of the homebuilder we be distressed at the increase cost that be involve in the high interest rate

 we have deep concern last december when the increase be make by the federal reserve before the budget be submit and without coordinate with the other fiscal agency of the government but in the light of the situation as we see it now the good thing that can be do be for congress to act upon the legislation we have recommended-

 we expect they to do that and we will do everything we can to expedite it

 robert g. spivack publishers newspaper syndicate mr. president i know you be concerned about vietnam and with your many domestic problem and i know there have be suggestion that you be not a very good politician but this be a political year and i wonder what your plan be for participate in the campaign particularly where pat brown be concern or some of the other race that might be of interest

 the president well bob i be inclined to agree with some of those people who think that i be not a very good politician some of the time i be go to try to do my job as well i can

 i do recognize this be election year i will be call upon to visit various part of the country i expect to do so i do not think that the people of california need any advice from i to know that governor brown have be a great governor

 i expect to repeat that statement if give the opportunity between now and november not only in california but other place

 i think a part of the president 's job be to go out into the country to meet the people to talk to they to exchange viewpoint with they

 i plan to take saturday off this weekend and to go into kentucky tennessee illinois and indiana and i will spend the weekend visit with the people of those states

 i do not expect to do that every week but as my duty here in the white house permit i will take advantage of every opportunity to go out into the country and discuss our program our conviction tell they what we stand for and ask for their support

 catherine mackin hearst newspapers mr. president at your last press conference you express some satisfaction in the economic and political growth of south america in view of this i wonder if you can tell we what progress be be make toward the summit of western hemisphere leader and when that meeting will be hold

 the president we do not have a date or a place the leader of the country in the hemisphere be now very carefully consider the subject for that conference the staff work be be do on the subject and the problem that the conference would deal with

 i be unable to and i think the leader of the hemisphere at this time be unable to designate a time or place

 i discuss with the president elect of bolivia today this conference and we look forward with a great deal of interest other country be willing to carry out the suggestion originally make by a latin american leader but the time have not be set

 we think it would be very fruitful and we would be glad to attend it and we will assume time be give for proper preparation by the staff people

 john scull abc news mr. president there have be an assortment of rumor from communist source during the past week which indicate that the north vietnamese leader may be plan to place american prisoner in factory or indeed even in oil installation in an effort to force you to call off the attack what would your reaction be to any such move

 the president john i have try to give my viewpoint and the viewpoint of this government on the man who have be capture i would hope that they would receive humane treatment in accordance with the principle of the geneva convention of 1949

 i believe that any other treatment accord they would not be accept by the civilized world and i do not want to make any prediction or speculation about what will happen

 i have express my viewpoint on what should happen

 richard wightman fairchild newspapers mr. president you recently say that freedom of information should never be restrict unless it affect national security one of my paper women 's wear daily obtain from one of its own source a news story about your daughter 's wedding and print it

 because of this the white house have withdraw our press credential to cover the wedding

 do not you think in light of this that it rather go against your own philosophy of press freedom

 the president i guess i would need a little more information before i get into a complete answer to your question

 the information i have indicate that in order to serve all the press certain rule be lay down and that the press for their convenience be ask to follow those rule so no one would have an advantage

 because either some do not accept the rule or some do not follow they some difference emerge but if i could have your permission to just step aside on any of the detailed wedding arrangement i would like very much to do so thank you very much

 mr. president would you give we your appraisal of how the vietnam war be go sir particularly whether or not more manpower might be require there

 the president yes more manpower will be require we be work day and night on all four front

 the economic front and the report this evening from ambassador lodge indicate that there have be some improvement in price and the economic situation there

 the diplomatic front our representative and the representative of other nation be now explore in other capital in many other place the possibility of try to find a way to get to the peace table

 on the political front plan be go forward for the election of the constituent assembly early in september and number and number of candidate be file for the place

 we be supply such advice and counsel as we can in the hope that this will be an orderly democratic election where the majority of the people can freely express themselves and select the leader of their choice

 on the military front our troop under general westmoreland 14 be give an excellent account of themselves they be attempt to anticipate the enemy and do everything they can to deter he from further aggression from additional infiltration and from the terror that he practice

 the result have be that the enemy have lose about 10 man for every loss the americans have suffer

 i believe the record for the last 10 week show that the enemy have lose in excess of 1,000 man each week our average have be something like 100 this week i believe it be less than 100 and i believe theirs be more than 1,200

 the mail that i get some 50 or 60 letter from the battlefront each week show the morale be high that the man be well train that they be well and adequately supply and properly lead

 we cease speculate a long time ago on how long this situation would endure but i have say to you and to the american people time and again and i repeat it today that we shall persist

 we shall send general westmoreland such man as he may require and request and they will be amply supply i have no doubt but what they will give a good account of themselves

 overall i would say that the report from the capture prisoner and there have be about twice as many defector so far this year as there be the same period last year some 10,000 compare to 4,000 -but the interview from a sample of 150 this week indicate that about 15 to 20 percent of the man that have be capture show that they be boy from 12 to 16 year of age

 they show that a good many of their people take 3 month in the infiltration walk down from north vietnam that a good many of they be suffer from malaria and beriberi and other disease

 the man who conduct the bombing on the military target the oil supply of hanoi and haiphong do a very careful but very perfect job they hit about 90 percent of the total capacity of that storage and almost 70 percent of it be destroy

 our report indicate that there be few civilian life lose if any one estimate be that one civilian be kill and he be the one that be at the alarm center

 we be very careful not to get out of the target area in order not to affect civilian population but we be go with our ally to continue to do everything that we can to deter the aggressor and to go to the peace table at the early possible date

 thank you mr. president

 as you know the united states have agree to attend the conference in manila on october 24th and 25th this will bring together the country that be most directly help the south vietnamese to resist aggression and to build a free nation

 the philippines korea and thailand extend the invitation which have be accept now by south vietnam australia new zealand and the united states

 the detail of the meeting include the agenda be now be work out in consultation among all the participant president marcos of the philippines have already indicate the scope of the conference and we expect

 --to review the military progress be make in the field

 --to examine how the other nation present can well support all these effort and

 --to explore the prospect for peaceful settlement of the vietnamese conflict in the light of all the proposal

 much of this effort be consistent with the work at honolulu in february which i consider highly successful at that meeting the government of south vietnam reinforce its determination

 --to move toward a democratic constitution and an elect government

 --to take concrete step to combat inflation

 --to invite vietcong to join they through the open arms program and

 --to multiply effort in health education and agriculture especially in the countryside

 each of these step as you know have produce result since our meeting in honolulu in february and we be very hopeful that they will receive increase support in our discussion in manila

 once aggression have be defeat a common dedication will also be necessary for the rehabilitation and the development of vietnam

 finally i have agree to speak to the national conference of editorial writers in new york city tomorrow on our european policy

 now i will be glad to take any question that you may have to ask

 q. as titular head of the democratic party how do you feel about the candidacy the gubernatorial candidacy of several democrats in the south who be avow segregationist

 the president i think it be very evident that some of these candidate to whom you refer differ with certain of my policy that deal with equal right and equal treatment for all of our citizen

 these gubernatorial candidate that you refer to have not ask i to support they and i have no plan to do so i doubt that the president should get into every race in every state

 q. mr. president be there any possibility you might visit south vietnam while you be in the far east

 the president no consideration have be give at this time to any such program or any such visit

 q. mr. president can you tell we if event of the past few day include your order to stop bomb part of the dmz have move we any close to peace

 the president no i think mr. moyers cover that in his press conference yesterday we be of course hopeful that any action we could take would be reciprocate and would lead in that direction but there be nothing that i could say that would be encouraging to you along that line as a result of that action

 q. mr. president a lot of observer be observe that apprehension over the economy and the so call race question be far outdistance vietnam as issue in this political campaign

 what be your assessment of these and other issue and would you assess for we not your administration 's but the republican opposition 's handling of these issue

 the president i think that every person will draw his own conclusion about the section of the country he be in and the local issue that may exist i have no doubt but what our full employment program our vietnam engagement our domestic problem include our civil right problem will all play a part in some of the campaign i think it will differ from place to place and candidate to candidate

 i think the 89th congress which be make up of both democrats and republicans but predominantly democrats have be a very effective and productive congress in the field of education it have pass 18 far reach educational measure 24 health measure it have pass more educational measure this congress than all the other 88 congresses combine i believe that most of the member of that congress will return home with a very fine record to support they and i think that most of they will be reelect

 q. mr. president the stock market today reach its low for the year i wonder if you could give we your reaction to the rather steady decline of the market in recent month

 the president i think a good many thing have a bearing on market fluctuation i think the high interest rate i think the attractiveness of other security i think some of the uncertainty that exist concern how much money the government itself will be spend next year i think the question of doubt about our tax policy all of those be give weight too but i think most of the people in this country feel like 1966 have be a very good year there have never be a well one and i believe that 1967 will be equally as good

 q. mr. president the united states have recently resume its assistance to indonesia would you tell we what your consideration be in take this action

 the president yes we think the leader of that country be do their good to build a stable government we think that be very important to the people of this world we feel ourselves in a position to be helpful the need be great we carefully evaluate the request and decide it would be in the good interest of our own people as well as the people of indonesia to extend the assistance we do i be glad that we have take that action

 q. mr. president sir monday the house be schedule to vote on the demonstration city bill title ii of that bill which you be urge member i understand to vote for provide incentive or rather bribe to local community to do away with their own school system to have open housing and to create educational park where there would be 25,000 or 35,000 child go to school this would require busing of child long distance and would also bring about a system to correct racial imbalance

 now you be a former schoolteacher i wonder if you would tell we why you think do away with the local school system as have be admit by educator in your administration would happen i wonder why you think this would be well

 the president first i would not concur with your legal analysis of the bill second i be glad of the opportunity that you have give i to state that i believe there be no domestic problem that be more critical than the problem of rebuild our city and give our people who live in the city opportunity to develop as healthy educated productive citizen of our society citizen who have the ability to get and to hold job and to take pride in the place in which they live

 in order to try to get at the root cause of the problem of the city i ask a task force of bipartisan leader of this nation to make a careful study of this measure their recommendation be contain in the demonstration city bill

 hearing have already be hold the senate carefully and thoroughly debate the measure and pass it by an overwhelming majority i do not think they give to it either the interpretation that you place upon it or the fear that you express

 i do hope that the house will take prompt and favorable action early next week

 as i say in the beginning and as i would repeat again i think it be one of the most important piece of legislation for the good of all american mankind that we can act upon this session

 q. mr. president some of your political opposition be say that the great society be suffer badly because of preoccupation with and spend for vietnam what be your reaction to that

 the president well i think the record speak for itself we have recommend approximately 90 bill to this session of congress after have the most productive session the last session in our history

 we have pass through both houses about 75 of those 90 bill i would suspect in the next 10 day we can pass another 10 when you pass 85 bill out of 90 recommend i think that be a pretty good box score

 we pass two measure through the house that have a majority for they in the senate but we could not get they vote on-14(b and the civil right bill

 we regret that but there will be other day and i be sure that in due time a majority will prevail i think all in all we have a very outstanding record this year i be very proud of it i think every member of congress of both party can take pride in it

 q. mr. president some of your critic also be say that your trip be motivate largely by political consideration would you comment on that

 the president no i do not think so i just think you would have to evaluate the critic and judge the circumstance and draw your own conclusion and i would not want anyway to spend all afternoon talk about my critic

 q. mr. president the republican coordinating committee include president eisenhower recently say that public order that is both crime in the street and riot be a problem of great concern to the people of this country

 they also charge that the johnson humphrey administration have do nothing of substance to date to deal with this problem i think that be the way they say it

 i wonder if you could answer this charge and two if you could assess what you think condition be in this country concern public order

 the president as i have say in rhode island indianapolis and before the methodist bishop in the white house last week every citizen in this land must be concern with law and order the voice of reason must drown out the voice of violence

 we have have very serious problem because of the condition in our city the problem that exist there and the protest make by our citizen

 i hope that we can keep violence out of the picture i have do everything that i know how in cooperation with the mayor the chief executive of the city and the chief executive of the states concern

 we be very conscious of the problem we be very concerned about it we be very determined to do everything within our prerogative to see that reason prevail over violence and that law and order always prevail

 we think that the protester themselves have the most to lose by disapproval of some of the action that have take place and while we be not oblivious to the problem that bring forth the protest we be concerned that they be protest without violence and within law and within order

 q. mr. president sir in a broad context on civil right there seem to be a dispute develop between those who feel that the federal government should merely strike down legal barrier to equality and those who feel that the government should play a more positive role in encourage integration in various facet of life

 i wonder if we could get your thinking on these two and where you stand on that argument

 the president yes i think the federal government must be a leader in this field and i have the 3 year i have be president try by word and action to do everything i could to bring about equality among the race in this country and to see that the brown decision affect the integration of our school be carry forward expeditiously and in accordance with the law to see that the civil right act pass in the late fifty and sixty and more recently in my administration be carry out in accordance with the intent of congress that the law be fully adhere to and fully enforce at all time

 i realize that in some instance there have be some harassment some mistake perhaps have be make some people have be enthusiastic and difference have develop

 but where those mistake have be make i think mr. gardner and the commissioner of education have be willing to always listen to any protest that might come and to carry out the law as congress intend it should be

 that will be the policy of our administration to continue to promote and to expedite the observance of the law of the land and to see that all citizen of this country be treat equally without discrimination

 q. former president eisenhower have say that we should use whatever be necessary not exclude nuclear weapon to end the fighting in vietnam what do you think of such a proposal

 the president without pass on the accuracy of your quotation of president eisenhower i would say it be the policy of this government to exercise the good judgment of which we be capable in an attempt to provide the maximum deterrence with a minimum involvement the easy thing we could do be get in a large war with other nation

 we be constantly concern with the danger of that at the same time we have no desire to capitulate or to retreat so it have be the policy of your present administration to provide the strength that general westmoreland feel be necessary to prevent the aggressor from succeed without attempt to either conquer or to invade or to destroy north vietnam

 our purpose be a limited one and that be to permit self determination for the people of south vietnam we be go to be concern with any effort that might take on more far reach objective or implication

 q. mr. president do you have any plan to take along a bipartisan congressional delegation to manila

 the president we have not go into that in any detail at this time if any plan develop along that line i will announce they and give you information on they i have nothing on it now

 q. mr. president the vietcong have recently modify two of its precondition for peace namely they no long seem to be demand that we withdraw before negotiation and they no long seem to be ask that they be the sole representative of the south vietnamese people

 do you feel these change have bring any significant contribution toward peace

 the president no i have not see any development in the recent week that would cause i to hold out hope or to give you any real justification for encouragement

 we pursue every indication that we have that might offer any possibility we always have an open mind and we be very anxious to find any basis for negotiation that would lead to an honorable peace but i can not in frankness be encouraging to you as a result of any specific action of recent week

 q. mr. president could you tell we your hope of what the result will be of this extensive tour of the pacific and asia that you be go to undertake later this month

 the president i would not want to get your hope up and have you disappoint because we do not achieve everything that i would like to see achieve

 i have a great many objective and hope for the people of that area of the world two third of humankind life in asia and we all know i think that their problem be very serious their life expectancy be very short comparatively speak their per capita income be very low

 in vietnam now we have the march of the aggressor 's heel stomp on the boundary of freedom love people

 we have the problem of man be kill there every day in an attempt to establish their right to self determination

 so i would hope that those nation who be commit against aggression in south vietnam could have a complete review of the military effort be make and the result of that effort together with any analysis that our leader might care to make

 i would think the political and the economic problem of that area of the world would also be a very important subject for discussion

 i think that we should thoroughly explore each leader 's idea about how an honorable peace can be reach and what course reconstruction effort follow the peace could very properly take and how we could participate in those effort

 i would expect if afford the opportunity to be call upon to review some of our thought about reconstruction about the development result from the election in south vietnam and the political development to be expect there

 i think generally speak it will give an opportunity for the leader of the man who be commit to battle in vietnam to meet and explore way of find peace for bring an end to the conflict for make that area of the world prosperous and peaceful in the year to come

 the invitation as you know be extend by other country i be sure that they will have some specific plan to suggest

 i want to be a good listener as well as an active participant

 i neglect to mention that mrs. johnson will accompany i on my trip she will join i in most of my official schedule during the conference as time permit she will visit various project and historic site to gather idea for use by her national committee for a more beautiful capital and similar civic group throughout the country

 q. will you give we your itinerary please

 the president i think that will be available for you at the door we will leave washington october 17th we will return via alaska arrive here sometime in the early part of november november 2nd or 3rd

 our first stop will be honolulu we will go nonstop from washington to honolulu we will have some refueling stop en route but our next stop will be new zealand

 as you know and this have be announce several time since i become president i have want very much to return to the scene of my young man day and go back to new zealand and australia where i spend some time in the early forty so i will be visit new zealand on october 19th for 2 day australia october 21st and 22d manila for the conference the 23d through the 27th thailand from october 27th through the 30th malaysia october 30th and 31st korea october 31st through november 2d and then we will return to the united states

 q. mr. president at one of your recent meeting with the governors sir governor scranton emerge and indicate that he feel you would have to ask for a tax increase next year could you give we your assessment of that situation now

 the president i can not add anything to the statement that i make in my message to congress i have succinctly summarize it the situation today be the same as then we be wait to know how much the congress will let we spend this come fiscal year

 there be 8 of the 15 appropriation bill that have not yet pass until they pass we do not know what the bill will be you can not reduce a bill that you have not receive as soon as they be pass we will immediately review those bill determine how much they can be reduce and then make a calculation of our revenue

 in the meantime i be ask secretary mcnamara to make a careful review of our propose expenditure first the expenditure that have already take place for the first quarter from june through september he will be visit with admiral sharp in honolulu he will leave saturday night for a visit with general westmoreland

 i hope by the time that he get back the congress will have send i some of these measure so we can determine how much we can spend what our revenue will be what the vietnam supplemental will be then we will try to make recommendation that will see that our provision be make for revenue to meet whatever deficit we have if that be possible i think that we can not do this until we receive these bill and these estimate

 we all should bear in mind however when the congress vote add ons to the remain eight bill it must be bear in mind that each vote to increase be likely to be a vote to increase the revenue later

 i will be specific with you just as soon as those bill get here and we analyze they we hope we would be able to analyze they so that by the time i would have to act on they i could get some rough estimate

 i be go to take whatever action be necessary to see that we have a sound fiscal policy but i can not take that action until the appropriation bill be vote upon and it be determine

 for instance yesterday in the senate the committee report a bill that provide three fourth of a billion dollar more than the senate ultimately vote so if we have calculate before the vote be take we would have be $ 750 million off

 we will take prompt action as soon as the congress make its recommendation and as soon as i can ascertain from the military what their good guess be as to the expenditure for the immediate future

 thank you mr. president





secretary connor secretary fowler senator mansfield senator mcclellan senator jackson distinguished speaker mccormack chairman dawson congressman holifield mrs. congresswoman dwyer other member of congress lady and gentleman distinguish mayors

 we be deeply grateful for your presence in the east room of the white house today

 in a large measure america 's history be a history of her transportation

 our early city be locate by deep water harbor and inland waterway they be nurture by ocean vessel and by flatboat

 the railroad allow we to move east and west a thousand town and more grow up along the railroad 's gleam rail

 the automobile stretch out over city and create suburbia in america

 trucks and modern highway bring bounty to remote region

 airplane help knit our nation together and knit it together with other nation throughout the world

 and today all americans be really neighbor

 transportation be the big industry we have in this country it involve one out of every five dollar in our economy

 our system of transportation be the great of any country in the world

 but we must face fact we must be realistic we must know and we must have the courage to let our people know that our system be no long adequate

 during the next two decade the demand for transportation in this country be go to more than double but we be already fall far behind with the demand as it be our lifeline be tangle

 today we be confront by traffic jam today we be confront by commuter crisis by crowded airport by crowded air lane by screech airplane by archaic equipment by safety abuse and road that scar our nation 's beauty

 we have come to this historic east room of the white house today to establish and to bring into be a department of transportation the second cabinet office to be add to the president 's cabinet in recent month

 this department of transportation that we be establish will have a mammoth task to untangle to coordinate and to build the national transportation system for america that america be deserve of

 and because the job be great i intend to appoint a strong man to fill it the new secretary will be my principal adviser and my strong right arm on all transportation matter i hope he will be the well equipped man in this country to give leadership to the country to the president to the cabinet to the congress

 among the many duty the new department will have several deserve very special notice

 --to improve the safety in every mean of transportation safety of our automobile our train our plane and our ship

 --to bring new technology to every mode of transportation by support and promote research and development

 --to solve our most pressing transportation problem

 a day will come in america when people and freight will move through this land of ours speedily efficiently safely dependably and cheaply that will be a good day and a great day in america

 our transportation system be build by the genius of free enterprise and as long as i be president it will be sustain by free enterprise

 in a few respect this bill fall short of our original hope it do not include the maritime administration as experience be gain in the department i would hope that the congress could reexamine its decision to leave this key transportation activity alone outside its jurisdiction

 but what be most important i think be that you for the first time in modern history have create and have bring for i to sign a measure give we a new cabinet department it be propose it will be establish and it will be in operation in the same year all of these thing take place in the same year

 it be the second major step in bring our government up to date with the time last year this congress establish the department of housing and urban affairs

 today you bring 31 agency and their bureau go in all direction into a single department of transportation under the guidance and leadership of a secretary of transportation

 i think in fairness candor require i to review that this recommendation be make many year ago by the hoover commission head by the distinguished former president this recommendation be urge upon the congress and the people and recommend many year ago by a most distinguished and popular president president dwight david eisenhower

 this recommendation be make and urge upon the president and the congress many year ago by the senate commerce committee and by dozen and dozen of enlighten intelligent member of both houses of both party

 what we be here today to do be to salute the member of both party the leadership of both party and everyone who contribute to finally bring our performance in line with our promise

 and i do not guess it would be good to say this and i may even be criticize for say it but this in effect be another coonskin on the wall

 thank all of you very much

the president good morning lady and gentleman

 q. mr. president i would like to ask a two part question with respect to negotiation first have you any response to the new british proposal on peace talk and second have you hear from secretary general u thant with respect to your own proposal along that line

 the president we have hear from the british we be delighted to have their view and their suggestion

 we be very agreeable and rather anxious to meet as i have say over the past month anywhere any time that hanoi be willing to come to a conference table

 we appreciate the interest of all peace love nation in arrange a cease fire in attempt to bring the disputing party together and in an effort to work out a conference where various view can be exchange

 america be ready to designate her representative today and will be glad to do so if the other party do likewise

 on the secretary general we have encourage he in every way we can to take leadership and initiative and use the full influence and resource of the united nations to bring about a stop of the violence on both side to bring an end to the total war by both side and any recommendation he make any suggestion he present will be very carefully consider and evaluate insofar as the united states be concern

 we will be glad to meet anyone more than halfway insofar as talk instead of fighting be concern

 q. mr. president what be your reaction to the report by the new york times from north vietnam about the result of our bombing there

 the president well i have follow our activity in vietnam very closely i think the country know and i would like to repeat again that it be the policy of this government to bomb only military target

 we realize that when you do that inevitably and almost invariably there be casualty there be loss of life

 we regret to see those loss we do everything we can to minimize they but they do occur in north vietnam as they do in south vietnam

 there be thousand of civilian who have die this year in south vietnam as a result of detonation of grenade and bomb and every casualty be to be regret

 but only military target have be authorize and i be inform that our man who be responsible for carry out our order have do their very good to execute those order as give

 q. mr. president on this last day of the old year what do you see ahead for the country in 1967

 the president i believe that we will have a good year

 this year have bring we great satisfaction in many field and some disappointment in other but on the whole i believe that generally there be more people work today than have ever work before they be make well wage than they have ever make before

 the farmer 's income be almost at an all time high almost a net income of $ 5,000 per year

 on the domestic front we have make great advance in educate more child in provide well school in improve their health in make deep dent in reduce poverty

 in our foreign affair we have have some disappointment we deeply regret that we have to send substantial force to vietnam in july of 1965 in the 18 month they have be there although we think there have be a decided turn in the military situation we have not be able to arrange a cease fire or to bring the other side to the conference table or to bring peace to the world

 we have diligently work for 18 month in every way we know how but we have not succeed

 that be one of our major regret

 we have do our good to hold nato together and we think we have have some success in that direction

 we think in latin america thing be on the upgrade

 we think in asia as a result of our manila conference and our other effort in that direction thing be go as good as we expect

 we can point in africa to the african development bank and while there be mixed situation in both africa and the middle east we have do our good to live up to our responsibility

 and we think generally speak the american people have much to be thankful for there be many challenge ahead there be many problem yet unsolved but in unity there be strength

 i believe that the new congress and this administration will put the interest of the nation first and do what we can to solve the problem that remain unsolved

 in short i think we have have a generally good year i think most americans believe that they have do reasonably well this year

 we all deeply regret that in 18 month we have not be able to bring peace to the world

 q. mr. president early this week communist china explode its fifth atomic device and the atomic energy commission have evidence that they be work on a nuclear bomb what do you believe these development hold for the future peace of the world

 the president it be our hope that all the nation of the world could reach some agreement in the field of nonproliferation in recent week i have feel encourage about the discussion that have take place i wish that it be possible to say to the american people and to the world that all the nation of the world could reach agreement in this field

 as yet we have not be able to bring that about and even when we bring it about we do not know that all nation will agree we be work to that end we think it be a desirable objective we will hope for the good

 q. mr. president yesterday the stock market close without make its traditional yearend rally and lead economist and businessman have mixed view about the performance expect of the economy in 1967 could you give we your assessment of what you expect of the economy next year

 the president i think it be very difficult to see economic indicator 12 month in advance and conclude just what will happen but i believe we will have a good year in 1967

 i believe we will have good employment good wage good profit and i do not see anything that would make i believe at this stage that we be go to be disappoint in those prediction

 q. mr. president this be a two part question one have you make a decision on the possibility of a tax increase in 1967

 the president no

 q. the other be do you think it be a mistake not to ask for a tax increase this year

 the president the answer be no to both question

 i presume you know we get two increase this year in taxis we take from the economy through administrative and legislative action several billion of dollar

 we think we take an adequate amount from the economy

 we estimate our deficit for this year at $ 6 billion 4 million at the beginning of the year and it turn out to be $ 2 billion 3 million

 we pass and i sign on march 15 the first tax measure which reinstitute some excise taxis accelerate the payment of other increase the withholding both by administrative and legislative action

 in september we submit another program that involve the investment credit provision and by suspend that increase our tax revenue a very minimal amount

 primarily that measure be pass in order to cool the economy most of the economist feel that be desirable and the congress agree

 i do not believe that we could have pass any more tax measure than we pass i think on the two tax measure pass it be desirable that we do so

 in march i meet with leader of business in the country dozen of they i consult with lead economist i ask they at the white house in march how many of they favor a tax increase and there be not a single hand that go up

 i read in the paper in retrospect some people feel very strongly there should have be another tax increase

 but in the light of the development of the economy at this moment i do not think so

 q. mr. president in his report from north vietnam mr. salisbury of the times speak of heavy destruction in residential area around two light industry there a rice mill and a textile plant sir i do not believe that these industry fall within the category of target objective previously announce by the defense department have there be a change in tactic to include such target or have there be some sort of mistake

 the president none whatever there have be no change so far as the evidence that we have at this time there have be no mistake i can only repeat to you what i have say before and what have be say by other department of the government our order be to bomb only military target those be the only order we have issue we believe that our man have carry out those order to the very good of their ability

 there will be civilian casualty in connection with the bombing of military target there be civilian casualty take place every day some this morning in south vietnam i be concern with casualty in both south vietnam and north vietnam and i wish that all of our people would be equally as concern

 i think that the quick we can have a peace conference the quick we can arrange a true cease fire the quick we can stop this total war on both side the well off all of our people will be

 but as long as it go on civilian be go to be kill casualty will occur and i regret every single casualty in both area

 q. mr. president general westmoreland say this week that he estimate the war would last several year do this change our strategy or administration planning on the war

 the president i think that we be make the plan that we believe be in the good interest of this country i do not think anyone can say with any precision when the peace conference will come when a truce can be arrange when a cease fire can be agree upon when agreement can be reach between nation

 we be prepare our people to protect our national interest and our agreement and our commitment lust how long they will be require to do so i be not able to predict if i do predict i would have no doubt but what i would live to regret it

 q. mr. president you begin this year tell the country that it should be able to afford both the military effort in vietnam and the necessary welfare reform measure at home some people insist that the war take too much of your budget even more people be suggest that the war will definitely interfere with the thing that need to be do in the come year

 although you be still weigh some of those decision what be the general outlook be the nation go to be able to afford what you think ought to be do at home

 the president yes i think the nation can afford to continue as we have to fight war on both front

 i do not think there be anyone who feel that we should not supply our man with what they need i would differ with you in that respect

 second i think there be those who feel that as long as we be in vietnam that we should reduce our expenditure every possible way here at home

 i feel that we ought to take all the water that we can out of the budget and i have spend several week try to do that

 but i be not one who feel as i say last january and as i will say again next january that we must neglect the health and the education of our child that we can overlook the need of our city that we must bring progress to a stop

 i think that we must strengthen our people we must continue our effort to reduce poverty we must continue the war against our ancient enemy just as we be continue it in south vietnam until aggression cease and until we can provide each child with all the education that he can take until we can see that our family have a decent income until we can secure the measure that be necessary to improve our city to curb pollution to reduce poverty

 i think this nation with a gross national product of some $ 700 to $ 800 billion can afford what it need to spend and i shall so recommend

 the exact amount i do not know this year 's budget be increase some because of increase need in vietnam

 in 18 month we have send several hundred thousand man there our budget this year will be somewhere between $ 125 and $ 130 billion

 we can not predict what our budget will be next year but as have be state by reliable authority and as have be write on good authority the general figure have be between $ 135 and $ 140 billion some say between $ 137 and $ 140 billion it be highly speculative allow some $ 2 or $ 3 billion one way or the other

 a great many of those decision have not yet be make there be several appeal pende from the military there be several important decision that have not yet be make in the field of health education and poverty

 i expect to return to washington early next week to conclude the meeting in that regard and to have my recommendation ready for the congress at as early a date as possible

 in short i think we can i think we must i think we will continue to do what be necessary at home and send our man abroad what they need to do their job

 q. mr. president there have be a great deal of talk lately about your image some writer discuss what they call a credibility gap the harris and gallup poll have indicate performance rating at the low point since you become president and there have be some unrest in the democratic party among the governors

 do you feel you have be do thing wrong what do you attribute all of this to

 the president well i would not want to make an indictment or review all of your contribution to this matter or all the reason and motivation of the various people who feel that mistake have be make

 in my own judgment we have do the good we could we have work at our job we have make the decision that we think ought to be make

 we realize that we have make some mistake although i know of no major decision that i have make that i would strike from the statute book tomorrow or would rewrite

 i think that some of the decision have not be popular

 i think that there have be criticism of the administration

 and i regret all of that i would hope that the nation would see thing pretty much alike in the day to come

 all i can say be i be go to do the good i can to make the proper decision those that be in the good interest of the country

 and then i think if you do what be good for the country the country will do what be good for we

 q. mr. president can you tell we what the chief factor be that you be now weigh in make your tax decision and when such a decision might come

 the president we be try to decide how much money we will spend next year in the military and civilian field

 we be try to study development in the economy

 we be try to determine the extent of our deficit

 we be try to anticipate as far ahead as we can economic indicator

 we will bring all of these people together the treasury the economic adviser the secretary of labor the secretary of commerce the congressional leadership and then attempt to make the recommendation that we think be justify

 we be work very hard on it but we have not make a decision we be not ready to announce one or make a recommendation today

 q. mr. president when do you expect to announce a decision on the supersonic transport

 the president we do not have any definite date the advisory committee that i have appoint have give great consideration to this general mckee will have an announcement in connection with it shortly just when the decision to move ahead will come on the part of the executive and the legislative i be unable to predict at this moment

 it be still a matter that be receive top consideration in the administration and of course after we make our study and our recommendation i be sure the congress will give it very prompt consideration and high level consideration

 but until we make ours and they conclude we will not know definitely what will happen

 q. mr. president would we consider deal directly with the vietcong in negotiate an end of the war which u thant seem to think be very necessary and also stop the bombing in the north sort of as a forerunner to peace negotiation

 the president we will be very glad to do more than our part in meet hanoi halfway in any possible cease fire or truce or peace conference negotiation

 i would be very interested in what their response be and what they would be agreeable to before irrevocably commit this country

 if you can look at all the decision they make and their reaction i think we would well be able to determine our own

 i have say on a number of occasion that we be ready to talk any time and anywhere that the vietcong will have no difficulty in make their view know to we

 but all the question turn on when be we willing to do it and be we willing to do it the answer to those question be a strong yes but up to this moment we have hear nothing from the other side

 you just can not have a one sided peace conference or a one sided cessation of hostility or ask our own boy not to defend themselves or to tie their hand behind they unless the other side be willing to reciprocate

 now i assure you that we be willing to meet they more than halfway if there be any indication of movement on their part

 q. mr. president in make your budget decision do you expect the deficit to be as low as it be this year

 the president no

 thank you mr. president





mr. speaker mr. vice president distinguished members of the congress

 i share with all of you the grief that you feel at the death today of one of the most beloved respect and effective member of this body the distinguished representative from rhode island mr. fogarty

 i have come here tonight to report to you that this be a time of testing for our nation

 at home the question be whether we will continue work for well opportunity for all americans when most americans be already live well than any people in history

 abroad the question be whether we have the staying power to fight a very costly war when the objective be limited and the danger to we be seemingly remote

 so our test be not whether we shrink from our country 's cause when the danger to we be obvious and dose at hand but rather whether we carry on when they seem obscure and distant and some think that it be safe to lay down our burden

 i have come tonight m ask this congress and this nation to resolve that issue to meet our commitment at home and abroad to continue to build a well america and to reaffirm this nation 's allegiance to freedom

 as president abraham lincoln say we must ask where we be and whither we be tend

 the last 3 year bear witness to our determination to make this a well country

 we have strike down legal barrier to equality

 we have improve the education of 7 million deprived child and this year alone we have enable almost 1 million student to go to college

 we have bring medical care to old people who be unable to afford it three and one half million americans have already receive treatment under medicare since july

 we have build a strong economy that have put almost 3 million more americans on the payroll in the last year alone

 we have include more than 9 million new worker under a high minimum wage

 we have launch new training program to provide job skill for almost 1 million americans

 we have help more than a thousand local community to attack poverty in the neighborhood of the poor we have set out to rebuild our city on a scale that have never be attempt before we have begin to rescue our water from the menace of pollution and to restore the beauty of our land and our countryside our city and our town

 we have give 1 million young americans a chance to earn through the neighborhood youth corps or through head start a chance to learn

 so together we have try to meet the need of our people and we have succeed in create a well life for the many as well as the few now we must answer whether our gain shall be the foundation of further progress or whether they shall be only monument to what might have be abandon now by a people who lack the will to see their great work through

 i believe that our people do not want to quit though the task be great the work hard often frustrating and success be a matter not of day or month but of year and sometimes it may be even decade

 i have come here tonight to discuss with you five way of carry forward the progress of these last 3 year these five way concern program partnership priority prosperity and peace

 first program we must see to it i think that these new program that we have pass work effectively and be administer in the good possible way

 three year ago we set out to create these new instrument of social progress this require trial and error and it have produce both but as we learn through success and failure we be change our strategy and we be try to improve our tactic in the long run these start some rewarding other inadequate and disappointing be crucial to success

 one example be the struggle to make life well for the less fortunate among we

 on a similar occasion at this rostrum in 1949 i hear a great american president harry s. truman declare this the american people have decide that poverty be just as wasteful and just as unnecessary as preventable disease

 many listen to president truman that day here in this chamber but few understand what be require and do anything about it the executive branch and the congress wait 15 long year before ever take any action on that challenge as it do on many other challenge that great president present and when 3 year ago you here in the congress join with i in a declaration of war on poverty then i warn it will not be a short or easy struggle no single weapon will suffice but we shall not rest until that war be win

 and i have come here to renew that pledge tonight

 i recommend that we intensify our effort to give the poor a chance to enjoy and to join in this nation 's progress

 i shall propose certain administrative change suggest by the congress as well as some that we have learn from our own trial and error

 i shall urge special method and special fund to reach the hundred of thousand of americans that be now trap in the ghetto of our big city and through head start to try to reach out to our very young little child the chance to learn be their bright hope and must command our full determination for learning bring skill and skill bring job and job bring responsibility and dignity as well as taxis

 this war like the war in vietnam be not a simple one there be no single battleline which you can plot each day on a chart the enemy be not easy to perceive or to isolate or to destroy there be mistake and there be setback but we be move and our direction be forward

 this be true with other program that be make and break new ground some do not yet have the capacity to absorb well or wisely all the money that could be put into they administrative skill and train manpower be just as vital to their success as dollar and i believe those skill will come but it will take time and patience and hard work success can not be force at a single stroke so we must continue to strengthen the administration of every program if that success be to come as we know it must

 we have do much in the space of two short year work together

 i have recommend and you the congress have approve 10 different reorganization plan combine and consolidate many bureaus of this government and create two entirely new cabinet department

 i have come tonight to propose that we establish a new department a department of business and labor

 by combine the department of commerce with the department of labor and other related agency i think we can create a more economical efficient and streamline instrument that will well serve a grow nation

 this be our goal throughout the entire federal government every program will be thoroughly evaluate grant in aid program will be improve and simplify as desire by many of our local administrator and our governors

 where there have be mistake we will try very hard to correct they

 where there have be progress we will try to build upon it

 our second objective be partnership to create an effective partnership at all level of government and i should treasure nothing more than to have that partnership begin between the executive and the congress

 the 88th and the 89th congresses pass more social and economic legislation than any two single congresses in american history most of you who be member of those congresses vote to pass most of those measure but your effort will come to nothing unless it reach the people

 federal energy be essential but it be not enough only a total work partnership among federal state and local government can succeed the test of that partnership will be the concern of each public organization each private institution and each responsible citizen

 each state county and city need to examine its capacity for government in today 's world as we be examine ours in the executive department and as i see you be examine your some will need to reorganize and reshape their method of administration as we be do other will need to revise their constitution and their law to bring they up to date as we be do above all i think we must work together and find way in which the multitude of small jurisdiction can be bring together more efficiently

 during the past 3 year we have return to state and local government about $ 40 billion in grant in aid this year alone 70 percent of our federal expenditure for domestic program will be distribute through the state and local government with federal assistance state and local government by 1970 will be spend close to $ 110 billion annually these enormous sum must be use wisely honestly and effectively we intend to work closely with the states and the locality to do exactly that

 our third objective be priority to move ahead on the priority that we have establish within the resource that be available

 i wish of course that we could do all that should be do and that we could do it now but the nation have many commitment and responsibility which make heavy demand upon our total resource no administration would more eagerly utilize for these program all the resource they require than the administration that start they

 so let we resolve now to do all that we can with what we have know that it be far far more than we have ever do before and far far less than our problem will ultimately require

 let we create new opportunity for our child and our young americans who need special help

 we should strengthen the head start program begin it for child 3 year old and maintain its educational momentum by follow through in the early year

 we should try new method of child development and care from the early year before it be too late to correct

 and i will propose these measure to the 90th congress

 let we insure that old americans and neglect americans share in their nation 's progress

 we should raise social security payment by an overall average of 20 percent that will add $ 4 billion 100 million to social security payment in the first year i will recommend that each of the 23 million americans now receive payment get an increase of at least 15 percent

 i will ask that you raise the minimum payment by 59 percent from $ 44 to $ 70 a month and to guarantee a minimum benefit of $ 100 a month for those with a total of 25 year of coverage we must raise the limit that retire worker can earn without lose social security income

 we must eliminate by law unjust discrimination in employment because of age

 we should embark upon a major effort to provide self help assistance to the forget in our midst the american indians and the migratory farm worker and we should reach with the hand of understanding to help those who live in rural poverty

 and i will propose these measure to the 90th congress

 so let we keep on improve the quality of life and enlarge the meaning of justice for all of our fellow americans

 we should transform our decaying slum into place of decency through the landmark model cities program i intend to seek for this effort this year the full amount that you in congress authorize last year

 we should call upon the genius of private industry and the most advanced technology to help rebuild our great city

 we should vastly expand the fight for dean air with a total attack on pollution at its source and because air like water do not respect manmade boundary we should set up regional airshed throughout this great land

 we should continue to carry to every corner of the nation our campaign for a beautiful america to dean up our town to make they more beautiful our city our countryside by create more park and more seashore and more open space for our child to play in and for the generation that come after we to enjoy

 we should continue to seek equality and justice for each citizen before a jury in seek a job in exercise his civil right we should find a solution to fair housing so that every american regardless of color have a decent home of his choice

 we should modernize our selective service system the national commission on selective service will shortly submit its report i will send you new recommendation to meet our military manpower need but let we resolve that this be to be the congress that make our draft law as fair and as effective as possible

 we should protect what justice brandeis call the right most value by civilized men"--the right to privacy we should outlaw all wiretapping public and private wherever and whenever it occur except when the security of this nation itself be at stake and only then with the strict governmental safeguard and we should exercise the full reach of our constitutional power to outlaw electronic bugging and snoop

 i hope this congress will try to help i do more for the consumer we should demand that the cost of credit be clearly and honestly express where average citizen can understand it we should immediately take step to prevent massive power failure to safeguard the home against hazardous household product and to assure safety in the pipeline that carry natural gas across our nation

 we should extend medicare benefit that be now deny to 1,300,000 permanently and totally disabled americans under 65 year of age

 we should improve the process of democracy by pass our election reform and financing proposal by tighten our law regulate lobbying and by restore a reasonable franchise to americans who move their residence

 we should develop educational television into a vital public resource to enrich our home educate our family and to provide assistance in our classroom we should insist that the public interest be fully serve through the public 's airwave

 and i will propose these measure to the 90th congress

 now we come to a question that weigh very heavily on all our mind on yours and mine this nation must make an all out effort to combat crime

 the 89th congress give we a new start in the attack on crime by pass the law enforcement assistance act that i recommend we appoint the national crime commission to study crime in america and to recommend the good way to carry that attack forward

 and while we do not have all the answer on the basis of its preliminary recommendation we be ready to move

 this be not a war that washington alone can win the idea of a national police force be repugnant to the american people crime must be root out in local community by local authority our policeman must be well train must be well pay and must be well support by the local citizen that they try to serve and to protect

 the national government can and expect to help

 and so i will recommend to the 90th congress the safe streets and crime control act of 1967 it will enable we to assist those state and city that try to make their street and home safe their police force well their correction system more effective and their court more efficient

 when the congress approve the federal government will be able to provide a substantial percentage of the cost

 --90 percent of the cost of develop the state and local plan master plan to combat crime in their area

 --60 percent of the cost of train new tactical unit develop instant communication and special alarm system and introduce the late equipment and technique so that they can become weapon in the war on crime

 --50 percent of the cost of build crime laboratory and police academy type center so that our citizen can be protect by the well train and serve by the good equip police to be find anywhere we will also recommend new method to prevent juvenile delinquent from become adult delinquent we will seek new partnership with states and city in order to deal with this hideous narcotic problem and we will recommend strict control on the sale of firearm

 at the heart of this attack on crime must be the conviction that a free america as abraham lincoln once say must let reverence for the law become the political religion of the nation

 our country 's law must be respect order must be maintain and i will support with all the constitutional power the president possess our nation 's law enforcement official in their attempt to control the crime and the violence that tear the fabric of our community

 many of these priority proposal will be build on foundation that have already be lay some will necessarily be small at first but every beginning be a consequence if we postpone this urgent work now it will simply have to be do later and later we will pay a much high price

 our fourth objective be prosperity to keep our economy move ahead move ahead steadily and safely

 we have now enjoy 6 year of unprecedented and rewarding prosperity last year in 1966

 --wage be the high in history and the unemployment rate announce yesterday reach the low point in 13 year

 --total after tax income of american family rise nearly 5 percent

 --corporate profit after taxis rise a little more than 5 percent

 --our gross national product advance 5.5 percent to about $ 740 billion

 --income per farm go up 6 percent now we have be greatly concerned because consumer price rise 4.5 percent over the 18 month since we decide to send troop to vietnam this be more than we have expect and the government try to do everything that we know how to do to hold it down yet we be not as successful as we wish to be in the 18 month after we enter world war ii price rise not 4.5 percent but 13.5 percent in the first 18 month after korea after the conflict break out there price rise not 4.5 percent but 11 percent during those two period we have opa price control that the congress give we and war labor board wage control

 since vietnam we have not ask for those control and we have try to avoid impose they we believe that we have do well but we make no pretense of having be successful or do as well as we wish

 our great disappointment in the economy during 1966 be the excessive rise in interest rate and the tightening of credit they impose very severe and very unfair burden on our home buyer and on our home builder and all those associate with the home industry

 last january and again last september i recommend fiscal and moderate tax measure to try to restrain the unbalanced pace of economic expansion legislatively and administratively we take several billion out of the economy with these measure in both instance the congress approve most of the recommendation rather promptly

 as 1966 end price stability be seemingly be restore wholesale price be low tonight than they be in august so be retail food price monetary condition be also ease most interest rate have retreat from their early peak more money now seem to be available

 give the cooperation of the federal reserve system which i so earnestly seek i be confident that this movement can continue i pledge the american people that i will do everything in a president 's power to lower interest rate and to ease money in this country the federal home loan bank board tomorrow morning will announce that it will make immediately available to saving and loan association an additional $ 1 billion and will lower from 6 percent to 5 3/4 percent the interest rate charge on those loan

 we shall continue on a sensible course of fiscal and budgetary policy that we believe will keep our economy grow without new inflationary spiral that will finance responsibly the need of our man in vietnam and the progress of our people at home that will support a significant improvement in our export surplus and will press forward toward easy credit and toward low interest rate

 i recommend to the congress a surcharge of 6 percent on both corporate and individual income taxis to last for 2 year or for so long as the unusual expenditure associate with our effort in vietnam continue i will promptly recommend an early termination date if a reduction in these expenditure permit it this surcharge will raise revenue by some $ 4.5 billion in the first year for example a person whose tax payment the tax he owe be $ 1,000 will pay under this proposal an extra $ 60 over the 12 month period or $ 5 a month the overwhelming majority of americans who pay taxis today be below that figure and they will pay substantially less than $ 5 a month married couple with two child with income up to $ 5,000 per year will be exempt from this tax as will single people with an income of up to $ 1,900 a year

 now if americans today still pay the income and excise tax rate in effect when i come into the presidency in the year 1964 their annual taxis would have be over $ 20 billion more than at present tax rate so this proposal be that while we have this problem and this emergency in vietnam while we be try to meet the need of our people at home your government ask for slightly more than one fourth of that tax cut each year in order to try to hold our budget deficit in fiscal 1968 within prudent limit and to give our country and to give our fighting man the help they need in this hour of trial

 for fiscal 1967 we estimate the budget expenditure to be $ 126.7 billion and revenue of $ 117 billion that will leave we a deficit this year of $ 9.7 billion

 for fiscal 1968 we estimate budget expenditure of $ 135 billion and with the tax measure recommend and a continue strong economy we estimate revenue will be $ 126.9 billion the deficit then will be $ 8.1 billion

 i will very soon forward all of my recommendation to the congress your be the responsibility to discuss and to debate they to approve or modify or reject they

 i welcome your view as i have welcome work with you for 30 year as a colleague and as vice president and president

 i should like to say to the members of the opposition whose number if i be not mistaken seem to have increase somewhat that the genius of the american political system have always be well express through creative debate that offer choice and reasonable alternative throughout our history great republicans and democrats have seem to understand this so let there be light and reason in our relation that be the way to a responsible session and a responsive government

 let we be remember as a president and a congress who try to improve the quality of life for every american not just the rich not just the poor but every man woman and child in this great nation of our

 we all go to school to good school or bad school we all take air into our lung clean air or polluted air we all drink water pure water or polluted water we all face sickness someday and some more often than we wish and old age as well we all have a stake in this great society in its economic growth in reduction of civil strife a great stake in good government

 we just must not arrest the pace of progress we have establish in this country in these year our child 's child will pay the price if we be not wise enough and courageous enough and determine enough to stand up and meet the nation 's need as well as we can in the time allot we

 abroad as at home there be also risk in change but abroad as at home there be a great risk in stand still no part of our foreign policy be so sacred that it ever remain beyond review we shall be flexible where condition in the world change and where man 's effort can change they for the well

 we be in the midst of a great transition a transition from narrow nationalism to international partnership from the harsh spirit of the cold war to the hopeful spirit of common humanity on a troubled and a threatened planet

 in latin america the american chief of state will be meet very shortly to give our hemispheric policy new direction

 we have come a long way in this hemisphere since the inter american effort in economic and social development be launch by the conference at bogota in 1960 under the leadership of president eisenhower the alliance for progress move dramatically forward under president kennedy there be new confidence that the voice of the people be be hear that the dignity of the individual be strong than ever in this hemisphere and we be face up to and meet many of the hemispheric problem together in this hemisphere that reform under democracy can be make to happen because it have happen so together i think we must now move to strike down the barrier to full cooperation among the american nation and to free the energy and the resource of two great continent on behalf of all of our citizen

 africa stand at an early stage of development than latin america it have yet to develop the transportation communication agriculture and above all the train man and woman without which growth be impossible there too the job will well be do if the nation and people of africa cooperate on a regional basis more and more our program for africa be go to be direct toward self help

 the future of africa be shadow by unsolved racial conflict our policy will continue to reflect our basic commitment as a people to support those who be prepared to work towards cooperation and harmony between race and to help those who demand change but reject the fool 's gold of violence

 in the middle east the spirit of good will toward all unfortunately have not yet take hold an already torture peace seem to be constantly threaten we shall try to use our influence to increase the possibility of improve relation among the nation of that region we be work hard at that task

 in the great subcontinent of south asia live more than a sixth of the earth 's population over the year we and other have invest very heavily in capital and food for the economic development of india and pakistan

 we be not prepared to see our assistance waste however in conflict it must strengthen their capacity to help themselves it must help these two nation both our friend to overcome poverty to emerge as self reliant leader and find term for reconciliation and cooperation

 in western europe we shall maintain in nato an integrate common defense but we also look forward to the time when great security can be achieve through measure of arm control and disarmament and through other form of practical agreement

 we be shape a new future of enlarged partnership in nuclear affair in economic and technical cooperation in trade negotiation in political consultation and in work together with the government and people of eastern europe and the soviet union

 the emerge spirit of confidence be precisely what we hope to achieve when we go to work a generation ago to put our shoulder to the wheel and try to help rebuild europe we face new challenge and opportunity then and there and we face also some danger but i believe that the people on both side of the atlantic as well as both side of this chamber want to face they together

 our relation with the soviet union and eastern europe be also in transition we have avoid both the act and the rhetoric of the cold war when we have differ with the soviet union or other nation for that matter i have try to differ quietly and with courtesy and without venom

 our objective be not to continue the cold war but to end it

 we have reach an agreement at the united nations on the peaceful use of outer space

 we have agree to open direct air flight with the soviet union

 we have remove more than 400 nonstrategic item from export control

 we be determined that the export import bank can allow commercial credit to poland hungary bulgaria and czechoslovakia as well as to romania and yugoslavia

 we have enter into a cultural agreement with the soviet union for another 2 year

 we have agree with bulgaria and hungary to upgrade our legation to embassy

 we have start discussion with international agency on way of increase contact with eastern european country

 this administration have take these step even as duty compel we to fulfill and execute alliance and treaty obligation throughout the world that be enter into before i become president

 so tonight i now ask and urge this congress to help our foreign and our commercial trade policy by pass an east west trade bill and by approve our consular convention with the soviet union

 the soviet union have in the past year increase its long range missile capability it have begin to place near moscow a limited antimissile defense my first responsibility to our people be to assure that no nation can ever find it rational to launch a nuclear attack or to use its nuclear power as a credible threat against we or against our ally

 i would emphasize that that be why an important link between russia and the united states be in our common interest in arm control and in disarmament we have the solemn duty to slow down the arm race between we if that be at all possible in both conventional and nuclear weapon and defense i think we be make some progress in that direction the first few month i be in office i realize that any additional race would impose on our people and on all mankind for that matter an additional waste of resource with no gain in security to either side

 i expect in the day ahead to closely consult and seek the advice of the congress about the possibility of international agreement bear directly upon this problem

 next to the pursuit of peace the really great challenge to the human family be the race between food supply and population increase that race tonight be be lose

 the time for rhetoric have clearly pass the time for concerted action be here and we must get on with the job

 we believe that three principle must prevail if our policy be to succeed

 first the develop nation must give high priority to food production include the use of technology and the capital of private enterprise

 second nation with food deficit must put more of their resource into voluntary family planning program

 and third the develop nation must all assist other nation to avoid starvation in the short run and to move rapidly towards the ability to feed themselves

 every member of the world community now bear a direct responsibility to help bring our most basic human account into balance

 i come now finally to southeast asia and to vietnam in particular soon i will submit to the congress a detailed report on that situation tonight i want to just review the essential point as briefly as i can

 we be in vietnam because the united states of america and our ally be commit by the seato treaty to act to meet the common danger of aggression in southeast asia

 we be in vietnam because an international agreement sign by the united states north vietnam and other in 1962 be be systematically violate by the communists that violation threaten the independence of all the small nation in southeast asia and threaten the peace of the entire region and perhaps the world

 we be there because the people of south vietnam have as much right to remain non communist if that be what they choose as north vietnam have to remain communist

 we be there because the congress have pledge by solemn vote to take all necessary measure to prevent further aggression

 no well word could describe our present course than those once speak by the great thomas jefferson

 it be the melancholy law of human society to be compel sometimes to choose a great evil in order to ward off a great

 we have choose to fight a limited war in vietnam in an attempt to prevent a large war a war almost certain to follow i believe if the communists succeed in overrunning and take over south vietnam by aggression and by force i believe and i be support by some authority that if they be not check now the world can expect to pay a great price to check they later

 that be what our statesman say when they debate this treaty and that be why it be ratify 82 to 1 by the senate many year ago

 you will remember that we stand in western europe 20 year ago be there anyone in this chamber tonight who doubt that the course of freedom be not change for the well because of the courage of that stand

 sixteen year ago we and other stop another kind of aggression this time it be in korea imagine how different asia might be today if we have fail to act when the communist army of north korea march south the asia of tomorrow will be far different because we have say in vietnam as we say 16 year ago in korea this far and no far

 i think i reveal no secret when i tell you that we be deal with a stubborn adversary who be commit to the use of force and terror to settle political question

 i wish i could report to you that the conflict be almost over this i can not do we face more cost more loss and more agony for the end be not yet i can not promise you that it will come this year or come next year our adversary still believe i think tonight that he can go on fighting long than we can and long than we and our ally will be prepared to stand up and resist

 our man in that area there be nearly 500,000 now have bear well the burden and the heat of the day their effort have deprive the communist enemy of the victory that he seek and that he expect a year ago we have steadily frustrate his main force general westmoreland report that the enemy can no long succeed on the battlefield

 so i must say to you that our pressure must be sustain and will be sustain until he realize that the war he start be cost he more than he can ever gain

 i know of no strategy more likely to attain that end than the strategy of accumulate slowly but inexorably every kind of material resource"--of laboriously teach troop the very element of their trade that and patience and i mean a great deal of patience

 our south vietnamese ally be also be test tonight because they must provide real security to the people live in the countryside and this mean reduce the terrorism and the armed attack which kidnap and kill 26,900 civilian in the last 32 month to level where they can be successfully control by the regular south vietnamese security force it mean bring to the villager an effective civilian government that they can respect and that they can rely upon and that they can participate in and that they can have a personal stake in we hope that government be now begin to emerge

 while i can not report the desire progress in the pacification effort the very distinguished and able ambassador henry cabot lodge report that south vietnam be turn to this task with a new sense of urgency we can help but only they can win this part of the war their task be to build and protect a new life in each rural province

 one result of our stand in vietnam be already clear

 it be this the people of asia now know that the door to independence be not go to be slam shut they know that it be possible for they to choose their own national destiny without coercion

 the performance of our man in vietnam back by the american people have create a feeling of confidence and unity among the independent nation of asia and the pacific i see it in their face in the 19 day that i spend in their home and in their country fear of external communist conquest in many asian nation be already subside and with this the spirit of hope be rise for the first time in history a common outlook and common institution be already emerge

 this forward movement be root in the ambition and the interest of asian nation themselves it be precisely this movement that we hope to accelerate when i speak at johns hopkins in baltimore in april 1965 and i pledge a much more massive effort to improve the life of man in that part of the world in the hope that we could take some of the fund that we be spend on bullet and bomb and spend it on school and production

 twenty month later our effort have produce a new reality the door of the billion dollar asian development bank that i recommend to the congress and you endorse almost unanimously i be proud to tell you be already open asians be engage tonight in regional effort in a dozen new direction their hope be high their faith be strong their confidence be deep

 and even as the war continue we shall play our part in carry forward this constructive historic development as recommend by the eugene black mission and if other nation will join we i will seek a special authorization from the congress of $ 200 million for east asian regional program

 we be eager to turn our resource to peace our effort in behalf of humanity i think need not be restrict by any parallel or by any boundary line the moment that peace come as i pledge in baltimore i will ask the congress for fund to join in an international program of reconstruction and development for all the people of vietnam and their deserve neighbor who wish our help

 we shall continue to hope for a reconciliation between the people of mainland china and the world community include work together in all the task of arm control security and progress on which the fate of the chinese people like their fellow man elsewhere depend

 we would be the first to welcome a china which decide to respect her neighbor right we would be the first to applaud she be she to apply her great energy and intelligence to improve the welfare of her people and we have no intention of try to deny her legitimate need for security and friendly relation with her neighboring country

 our hope that all of this will someday happen rest on the conviction that we the american people and our ally will and be go to see vietnam through to an honorable peace

 we will support all appropriate initiative by the united nations and other which can bring the several party together for unconditional discussion of peace anywhere any time and we will continue to take every possible initiative ourselves to constantly probe for peace

 until such effort succeed or until the infiltration cease or until the conflict subside i think the course of wisdom for this country be that we just must firmly pursue our present course we will stand firm in vietnam

 i think you know that our fight man there tonight bear the heavy burden of all with their life they serve their nation we must give they nothing less than our full support and we have give they that nothing less than the determination that americans have always give their fighting man whatever our sacrifice here even if it be more than $ 5 a month it be small compare to their own

 how long it will take i can not prophesy i only know that the will of the american people i think be tonight be test

 whether we can fight a war of limited objective over a period of time and keep alive the hope of independence and stability for people other than ourselves whether we can continue to act with restraint when the temptation to get it over with be invite but dangerous whether we can accept the necessity of choose a great evil in order to ward off a great whether we can do these without arouse the hatred and the passion that be ordinarily loose in time of war on all these question so much turn

 the answer will determine not only where we be but whither we be tend

 a time of testing yes and a time of transition the transition be sometimes slow sometimes unpopular almost always very painful and often quite dangerous

 but we have live with danger for a long time before and we shall live with it for a long time yet to come we know that man be bear unto trouble we also know that this nation be not forge and do not survive and grow and prosper without a great deal of sacrifice from a great many man

 for all the disorder that we must deal with and all the frustration that concern we and all the anxiety that we be call upon to resolve for all the issue we must face with the agony that attend they let we remember that those who expect to reap the blessing of freedom must like man undergo the fatigue of support it

 but let we also count not only our burden but our blessing for they be many

 and let we give thank to the one who govern we all

 let we draw encouragement from the sign of hope for they too be many

 let we remember that we have be test before and america have never be find want

 so with your understanding i would hope your confidence and your support we be go to persist and we be go to succeed



 mr. speaker mr. vice president distinguished members of the congress

 i share with all of you the grief that you feel at the death today of one of the most beloved respect and effective member of this body the distinguished representative from rhode island mr. fogarty

 i have come here tonight to report to you that this be a time of testing for our nation

 at home the question be whether we will continue work for well opportunity for all americans when most americans be already live well than any people in history

 abroad the question be whether we have the staying power to fight a very costly war when the objective be limited and the danger to we be seemingly remote

 so our test be not whether we shrink from our country 's cause when the danger to we be obvious and dose at hand but rather whether we carry on when they seem obscure and distant and some think that it be safe to lay down our burden

 i have come tonight m ask this congress and this nation to resolve that issue to meet our commitment at home and abroad to continue to build a well america and to reaffirm this nation 's allegiance to freedom

 as president abraham lincoln say we must ask where we be and whither we be tend

 the last 3 year bear witness to our determination to make this a well country

 we have strike down legal barrier to equality

 we have improve the education of 7 million deprived child and this year alone we have enable almost 1 million student to go to college

 we have bring medical care to old people who be unable to afford it three and one half million americans have already receive treatment under medicare since july

 we have build a strong economy that have put almost 3 million more americans on the payroll in the last year alone

 we have include more than 9 million new worker under a high minimum wage

 we have launch new training program to provide job skill for almost 1 million americans

 we have help more than a thousand local community to attack poverty in the neighborhood of the poor we have set out to rebuild our city on a scale that have never be attempt before we have begin to rescue our water from the menace of pollution and to restore the beauty of our land and our countryside our city and our town

 we have give 1 million young americans a chance to earn through the neighborhood youth corps or through head start a chance to learn

 so together we have try to meet the need of our people and we have succeed in create a well life for the many as well as the few now we must answer whether our gain shall be the foundation of further progress or whether they shall be only monument to what might have be abandon now by a people who lack the will to see their great work through

 i believe that our people do not want to quit though the task be great the work hard often frustrating and success be a matter not of day or month but of year and sometimes it may be even decade

 i have come here tonight to discuss with you five way of carry forward the progress of these last 3 year these five way concern program partnership priority prosperity and peace

 first program we must see to it i think that these new program that we have pass work effectively and be administer in the good possible way

 three year ago we set out to create these new instrument of social progress this require trial and error and it have produce both but as we learn through success and failure we be change our strategy and we be try to improve our tactic in the long run these start some rewarding other inadequate and disappointing be crucial to success

 one example be the struggle to make life well for the less fortunate among we

 on a similar occasion at this rostrum in 1949 i hear a great american president harry s. truman declare this the american people have decide that poverty be just as wasteful and just as unnecessary as preventable disease

 many listen to president truman that day here in this chamber but few understand what be require and do anything about it the executive branch and the congress wait 15 long year before ever take any action on that challenge as it do on many other challenge that great president present and when 3 year ago you here in the congress join with i in a declaration of war on poverty then i warn it will not be a short or easy struggle no single weapon will suffice but we shall not rest until that war be win

 and i have come here to renew that pledge tonight

 i recommend that we intensify our effort to give the poor a chance to enjoy and to join in this nation 's progress

 i shall propose certain administrative change suggest by the congress as well as some that we have learn from our own trial and error

 i shall urge special method and special fund to reach the hundred of thousand of americans that be now trap in the ghetto of our big city and through head start to try to reach out to our very young little child the chance to learn be their bright hope and must command our full determination for learning bring skill and skill bring job and job bring responsibility and dignity as well as taxis

 this war like the war in vietnam be not a simple one there be no single battleline which you can plot each day on a chart the enemy be not easy to perceive or to isolate or to destroy there be mistake and there be setback but we be move and our direction be forward

 this be true with other program that be make and break new ground some do not yet have the capacity to absorb well or wisely all the money that could be put into they administrative skill and train manpower be just as vital to their success as dollar and i believe those skill will come but it will take time and patience and hard work success can not be force at a single stroke so we must continue to strengthen the administration of every program if that success be to come as we know it must

 we have do much in the space of two short year work together

 i have recommend and you the congress have approve 10 different reorganization plan combine and consolidate many bureaus of this government and create two entirely new cabinet department

 i have come tonight to propose that we establish a new department a department of business and labor

 by combine the department of commerce with the department of labor and other related agency i think we can create a more economical efficient and streamline instrument that will well serve a grow nation

 this be our goal throughout the entire federal government every program will be thoroughly evaluate grant in aid program will be improve and simplify as desire by many of our local administrator and our governors

 where there have be mistake we will try very hard to correct they

 where there have be progress we will try to build upon it

 our second objective be partnership to create an effective partnership at all level of government and i should treasure nothing more than to have that partnership begin between the executive and the congress

 the 88th and the 89th congresses pass more social and economic legislation than any two single congresses in american history most of you who be member of those congresses vote to pass most of those measure but your effort will come to nothing unless it reach the people

 federal energy be essential but it be not enough only a total work partnership among federal state and local government can succeed the test of that partnership will be the concern of each public organization each private institution and each responsible citizen

 each state county and city need to examine its capacity for government in today 's world as we be examine ours in the executive department and as i see you be examine your some will need to reorganize and reshape their method of administration as we be do other will need to revise their constitution and their law to bring they up to date as we be do above all i think we must work together and find way in which the multitude of small jurisdiction can be bring together more efficiently

 during the past 3 year we have return to state and local government about $ 40 billion in grant in aid this year alone 70 percent of our federal expenditure for domestic program will be distribute through the state and local government with federal assistance state and local government by 1970 will be spend close to $ 110 billion annually these enormous sum must be use wisely honestly and effectively we intend to work closely with the states and the locality to do exactly that

 our third objective be priority to move ahead on the priority that we have establish within the resource that be available

 i wish of course that we could do all that should be do and that we could do it now but the nation have many commitment and responsibility which make heavy demand upon our total resource no administration would more eagerly utilize for these program all the resource they require than the administration that start they

 so let we resolve now to do all that we can with what we have know that it be far far more than we have ever do before and far far less than our problem will ultimately require

 let we create new opportunity for our child and our young americans who need special help

 we should strengthen the head start program begin it for child 3 year old and maintain its educational momentum by follow through in the early year

 we should try new method of child development and care from the early year before it be too late to correct

 and i will propose these measure to the 90th congress

 let we insure that old americans and neglect americans share in their nation 's progress

 we should raise social security payment by an overall average of 20 percent that will add $ 4 billion 100 million to social security payment in the first year i will recommend that each of the 23 million americans now receive payment get an increase of at least 15 percent

 i will ask that you raise the minimum payment by 59 percent from $ 44 to $ 70 a month and to guarantee a minimum benefit of $ 100 a month for those with a total of 25 year of coverage we must raise the limit that retire worker can earn without lose social security income

 we must eliminate by law unjust discrimination in employment because of age

 we should embark upon a major effort to provide self help assistance to the forget in our midst the american indians and the migratory farm worker and we should reach with the hand of understanding to help those who live in rural poverty

 and i will propose these measure to the 90th congress

 so let we keep on improve the quality of life and enlarge the meaning of justice for all of our fellow americans

 we should transform our decaying slum into place of decency through the landmark model cities program i intend to seek for this effort this year the full amount that you in congress authorize last year

 we should call upon the genius of private industry and the most advanced technology to help rebuild our great city

 we should vastly expand the fight for dean air with a total attack on pollution at its source and because air like water do not respect manmade boundary we should set up regional airshed throughout this great land

 we should continue to carry to every corner of the nation our campaign for a beautiful america to dean up our town to make they more beautiful our city our countryside by create more park and more seashore and more open space for our child to play in and for the generation that come after we to enjoy

 we should continue to seek equality and justice for each citizen before a jury in seek a job in exercise his civil right we should find a solution to fair housing so that every american regardless of color have a decent home of his choice

 we should modernize our selective service system the national commission on selective service will shortly submit its report i will send you new recommendation to meet our military manpower need but let we resolve that this be to be the congress that make our draft law as fair and as effective as possible

 we should protect what justice brandeis call the right most value by civilized men"--the right to privacy we should outlaw all wiretapping public and private wherever and whenever it occur except when the security of this nation itself be at stake and only then with the strict governmental safeguard and we should exercise the full reach of our constitutional power to outlaw electronic bugging and snoop

 i hope this congress will try to help i do more for the consumer we should demand that the cost of credit be clearly and honestly express where average citizen can understand it we should immediately take step to prevent massive power failure to safeguard the home against hazardous household product and to assure safety in the pipeline that carry natural gas across our nation

 we should extend medicare benefit that be now deny to 1,300,000 permanently and totally disabled americans under 65 year of age

 we should improve the process of democracy by pass our election reform and financing proposal by tighten our law regulate lobbying and by restore a reasonable franchise to americans who move their residence

 we should develop educational television into a vital public resource to enrich our home educate our family and to provide assistance in our classroom we should insist that the public interest be fully serve through the public 's airwave

 and i will propose these measure to the 90th congress

 now we come to a question that weigh very heavily on all our mind on yours and mine this nation must make an all out effort to combat crime

 the 89th congress give we a new start in the attack on crime by pass the law enforcement assistance act that i recommend we appoint the national crime commission to study crime in america and to recommend the good way to carry that attack forward

 and while we do not have all the answer on the basis of its preliminary recommendation we be ready to move

 this be not a war that washington alone can win the idea of a national police force be repugnant to the american people crime must be root out in local community by local authority our policeman must be well train must be well pay and must be well support by the local citizen that they try to serve and to protect

 the national government can and expect to help

 and so i will recommend to the 90th congress the safe streets and crime control act of 1967 it will enable we to assist those state and city that try to make their street and home safe their police force well their correction system more effective and their court more efficient

 when the congress approve the federal government will be able to provide a substantial percentage of the cost

 --90 percent of the cost of develop the state and local plan master plan to combat crime in their area

 --60 percent of the cost of train new tactical unit develop instant communication and special alarm system and introduce the late equipment and technique so that they can become weapon in the war on crime

 --50 percent of the cost of build crime laboratory and police academy type center so that our citizen can be protect by the well train and serve by the good equip police to be find anywhere we will also recommend new method to prevent juvenile delinquent from become adult delinquent we will seek new partnership with states and city in order to deal with this hideous narcotic problem and we will recommend strict control on the sale of firearm

 at the heart of this attack on crime must be the conviction that a free america as abraham lincoln once say must let reverence for the law become the political religion of the nation

 our country 's law must be respect order must be maintain and i will support with all the constitutional power the president possess our nation 's law enforcement official in their attempt to control the crime and the violence that tear the fabric of our community

 many of these priority proposal will be build on foundation that have already be lay some will necessarily be small at first but every beginning be a consequence if we postpone this urgent work now it will simply have to be do later and later we will pay a much high price

 our fourth objective be prosperity to keep our economy move ahead move ahead steadily and safely

 we have now enjoy 6 year of unprecedented and rewarding prosperity last year in 1966

 --wage be the high in history and the unemployment rate announce yesterday reach the low point in 13 year

 --total after tax income of american family rise nearly 5 percent

 --corporate profit after taxis rise a little more than 5 percent

 --our gross national product advance 5.5 percent to about $ 740 billion

 --income per farm go up 6 percent now we have be greatly concerned because consumer price rise 4.5 percent over the 18 month since we decide to send troop to vietnam this be more than we have expect and the government try to do everything that we know how to do to hold it down yet we be not as successful as we wish to be in the 18 month after we enter world war ii price rise not 4.5 percent but 13.5 percent in the first 18 month after korea after the conflict break out there price rise not 4.5 percent but 11 percent during those two period we have opa price control that the congress give we and war labor board wage control

 since vietnam we have not ask for those control and we have try to avoid impose they we believe that we have do well but we make no pretense of having be successful or do as well as we wish

 our great disappointment in the economy during 1966 be the excessive rise in interest rate and the tightening of credit they impose very severe and very unfair burden on our home buyer and on our home builder and all those associate with the home industry

 last january and again last september i recommend fiscal and moderate tax measure to try to restrain the unbalanced pace of economic expansion legislatively and administratively we take several billion out of the economy with these measure in both instance the congress approve most of the recommendation rather promptly

 as 1966 end price stability be seemingly be restore wholesale price be low tonight than they be in august so be retail food price monetary condition be also ease most interest rate have retreat from their early peak more money now seem to be available

 give the cooperation of the federal reserve system which i so earnestly seek i be confident that this movement can continue i pledge the american people that i will do everything in a president 's power to lower interest rate and to ease money in this country the federal home loan bank board tomorrow morning will announce that it will make immediately available to saving and loan association an additional $ 1 billion and will lower from 6 percent to 5 3/4 percent the interest rate charge on those loan

 we shall continue on a sensible course of fiscal and budgetary policy that we believe will keep our economy grow without new inflationary spiral that will finance responsibly the need of our man in vietnam and the progress of our people at home that will support a significant improvement in our export surplus and will press forward toward easy credit and toward low interest rate

 i recommend to the congress a surcharge of 6 percent on both corporate and individual income taxis to last for 2 year or for so long as the unusual expenditure associate with our effort in vietnam continue i will promptly recommend an early termination date if a reduction in these expenditure permit it this surcharge will raise revenue by some $ 4.5 billion in the first year for example a person whose tax payment the tax he owe be $ 1,000 will pay under this proposal an extra $ 60 over the 12 month period or $ 5 a month the overwhelming majority of americans who pay taxis today be below that figure and they will pay substantially less than $ 5 a month married couple with two child with income up to $ 5,000 per year will be exempt from this tax as will single people with an income of up to $ 1,900 a year

 now if americans today still pay the income and excise tax rate in effect when i come into the presidency in the year 1964 their annual taxis would have be over $ 20 billion more than at present tax rate so this proposal be that while we have this problem and this emergency in vietnam while we be try to meet the need of our people at home your government ask for slightly more than one fourth of that tax cut each year in order to try to hold our budget deficit in fiscal 1968 within prudent limit and to give our country and to give our fighting man the help they need in this hour of trial

 for fiscal 1967 we estimate the budget expenditure to be $ 126.7 billion and revenue of $ 117 billion that will leave we a deficit this year of $ 9.7 billion

 for fiscal 1968 we estimate budget expenditure of $ 135 billion and with the tax measure recommend and a continue strong economy we estimate revenue will be $ 126.9 billion the deficit then will be $ 8.1 billion

 i will very soon forward all of my recommendation to the congress your be the responsibility to discuss and to debate they to approve or modify or reject they

 i welcome your view as i have welcome work with you for 30 year as a colleague and as vice president and president

 i should like to say to the members of the opposition whose number if i be not mistaken seem to have increase somewhat that the genius of the american political system have always be well express through creative debate that offer choice and reasonable alternative throughout our history great republicans and democrats have seem to understand this so let there be light and reason in our relation that be the way to a responsible session and a responsive government

 let we be remember as a president and a congress who try to improve the quality of life for every american not just the rich not just the poor but every man woman and child in this great nation of our

 we all go to school to good school or bad school we all take air into our lung clean air or polluted air we all drink water pure water or polluted water we all face sickness someday and some more often than we wish and old age as well we all have a stake in this great society in its economic growth in reduction of civil strife a great stake in good government

 we just must not arrest the pace of progress we have establish in this country in these year our child 's child will pay the price if we be not wise enough and courageous enough and determine enough to stand up and meet the nation 's need as well as we can in the time allot we

 abroad as at home there be also risk in change but abroad as at home there be a great risk in stand still no part of our foreign policy be so sacred that it ever remain beyond review we shall be flexible where condition in the world change and where man 's effort can change they for the well

 we be in the midst of a great transition a transition from narrow nationalism to international partnership from the harsh spirit of the cold war to the hopeful spirit of common humanity on a troubled and a threatened planet

 in latin america the american chief of state will be meet very shortly to give our hemispheric policy new direction

 we have come a long way in this hemisphere since the inter american effort in economic and social development be launch by the conference at bogota in 1960 under the leadership of president eisenhower the alliance for progress move dramatically forward under president kennedy there be new confidence that the voice of the people be be hear that the dignity of the individual be strong than ever in this hemisphere and we be face up to and meet many of the hemispheric problem together in this hemisphere that reform under democracy can be make to happen because it have happen so together i think we must now move to strike down the barrier to full cooperation among the american nation and to free the energy and the resource of two great continent on behalf of all of our citizen

 africa stand at an early stage of development than latin america it have yet to develop the transportation communication agriculture and above all the train man and woman without which growth be impossible there too the job will well be do if the nation and people of africa cooperate on a regional basis more and more our program for africa be go to be direct toward self help

 the future of africa be shadow by unsolved racial conflict our policy will continue to reflect our basic commitment as a people to support those who be prepared to work towards cooperation and harmony between race and to help those who demand change but reject the fool 's gold of violence

 in the middle east the spirit of good will toward all unfortunately have not yet take hold an already torture peace seem to be constantly threaten we shall try to use our influence to increase the possibility of improve relation among the nation of that region we be work hard at that task

 in the great subcontinent of south asia live more than a sixth of the earth 's population over the year we and other have invest very heavily in capital and food for the economic development of india and pakistan

 we be not prepared to see our assistance waste however in conflict it must strengthen their capacity to help themselves it must help these two nation both our friend to overcome poverty to emerge as self reliant leader and find term for reconciliation and cooperation

 in western europe we shall maintain in nato an integrate common defense but we also look forward to the time when great security can be achieve through measure of arm control and disarmament and through other form of practical agreement

 we be shape a new future of enlarged partnership in nuclear affair in economic and technical cooperation in trade negotiation in political consultation and in work together with the government and people of eastern europe and the soviet union

 the emerge spirit of confidence be precisely what we hope to achieve when we go to work a generation ago to put our shoulder to the wheel and try to help rebuild europe we face new challenge and opportunity then and there and we face also some danger but i believe that the people on both side of the atlantic as well as both side of this chamber want to face they together

 our relation with the soviet union and eastern europe be also in transition we have avoid both the act and the rhetoric of the cold war when we have differ with the soviet union or other nation for that matter i have try to differ quietly and with courtesy and without venom

 our objective be not to continue the cold war but to end it

 we have reach an agreement at the united nations on the peaceful use of outer space

 we have agree to open direct air flight with the soviet union

 we have remove more than 400 nonstrategic item from export control

 we be determined that the export import bank can allow commercial credit to poland hungary bulgaria and czechoslovakia as well as to romania and yugoslavia

 we have enter into a cultural agreement with the soviet union for another 2 year

 we have agree with bulgaria and hungary to upgrade our legation to embassy

 we have start discussion with international agency on way of increase contact with eastern european country

 this administration have take these step even as duty compel we to fulfill and execute alliance and treaty obligation throughout the world that be enter into before i become president

 so tonight i now ask and urge this congress to help our foreign and our commercial trade policy by pass an east west trade bill and by approve our consular convention with the soviet union

 the soviet union have in the past year increase its long range missile capability it have begin to place near moscow a limited antimissile defense my first responsibility to our people be to assure that no nation can ever find it rational to launch a nuclear attack or to use its nuclear power as a credible threat against we or against our ally

 i would emphasize that that be why an important link between russia and the united states be in our common interest in arm control and in disarmament we have the solemn duty to slow down the arm race between we if that be at all possible in both conventional and nuclear weapon and defense i think we be make some progress in that direction the first few month i be in office i realize that any additional race would impose on our people and on all mankind for that matter an additional waste of resource with no gain in security to either side

 i expect in the day ahead to closely consult and seek the advice of the congress about the possibility of international agreement bear directly upon this problem

 next to the pursuit of peace the really great challenge to the human family be the race between food supply and population increase that race tonight be be lose

 the time for rhetoric have clearly pass the time for concerted action be here and we must get on with the job

 we believe that three principle must prevail if our policy be to succeed

 first the develop nation must give high priority to food production include the use of technology and the capital of private enterprise

 second nation with food deficit must put more of their resource into voluntary family planning program

 and third the develop nation must all assist other nation to avoid starvation in the short run and to move rapidly towards the ability to feed themselves

 every member of the world community now bear a direct responsibility to help bring our most basic human account into balance

 i come now finally to southeast asia and to vietnam in particular soon i will submit to the congress a detailed report on that situation tonight i want to just review the essential point as briefly as i can

 we be in vietnam because the united states of america and our ally be commit by the seato treaty to act to meet the common danger of aggression in southeast asia

 we be in vietnam because an international agreement sign by the united states north vietnam and other in 1962 be be systematically violate by the communists that violation threaten the independence of all the small nation in southeast asia and threaten the peace of the entire region and perhaps the world

 we be there because the people of south vietnam have as much right to remain non communist if that be what they choose as north vietnam have to remain communist

 we be there because the congress have pledge by solemn vote to take all necessary measure to prevent further aggression

 no well word could describe our present course than those once speak by the great thomas jefferson

 it be the melancholy law of human society to be compel sometimes to choose a great evil in order to ward off a great

 we have choose to fight a limited war in vietnam in an attempt to prevent a large war a war almost certain to follow i believe if the communists succeed in overrunning and take over south vietnam by aggression and by force i believe and i be support by some authority that if they be not check now the world can expect to pay a great price to check they later

 that be what our statesman say when they debate this treaty and that be why it be ratify 82 to 1 by the senate many year ago

 you will remember that we stand in western europe 20 year ago be there anyone in this chamber tonight who doubt that the course of freedom be not change for the well because of the courage of that stand

 sixteen year ago we and other stop another kind of aggression this time it be in korea imagine how different asia might be today if we have fail to act when the communist army of north korea march south the asia of tomorrow will be far different because we have say in vietnam as we say 16 year ago in korea this far and no far

 i think i reveal no secret when i tell you that we be deal with a stubborn adversary who be commit to the use of force and terror to settle political question

 i wish i could report to you that the conflict be almost over this i can not do we face more cost more loss and more agony for the end be not yet i can not promise you that it will come this year or come next year our adversary still believe i think tonight that he can go on fighting long than we can and long than we and our ally will be prepared to stand up and resist

 our man in that area there be nearly 500,000 now have bear well the burden and the heat of the day their effort have deprive the communist enemy of the victory that he seek and that he expect a year ago we have steadily frustrate his main force general westmoreland report that the enemy can no long succeed on the battlefield

 so i must say to you that our pressure must be sustain and will be sustain until he realize that the war he start be cost he more than he can ever gain

 i know of no strategy more likely to attain that end than the strategy of accumulate slowly but inexorably every kind of material resource"--of laboriously teach troop the very element of their trade that and patience and i mean a great deal of patience

 our south vietnamese ally be also be test tonight because they must provide real security to the people live in the countryside and this mean reduce the terrorism and the armed attack which kidnap and kill 26,900 civilian in the last 32 month to level where they can be successfully control by the regular south vietnamese security force it mean bring to the villager an effective civilian government that they can respect and that they can rely upon and that they can participate in and that they can have a personal stake in we hope that government be now begin to emerge

 while i can not report the desire progress in the pacification effort the very distinguished and able ambassador henry cabot lodge report that south vietnam be turn to this task with a new sense of urgency we can help but only they can win this part of the war their task be to build and protect a new life in each rural province

 one result of our stand in vietnam be already clear

 it be this the people of asia now know that the door to independence be not go to be slam shut they know that it be possible for they to choose their own national destiny without coercion

 the performance of our man in vietnam back by the american people have create a feeling of confidence and unity among the independent nation of asia and the pacific i see it in their face in the 19 day that i spend in their home and in their country fear of external communist conquest in many asian nation be already subside and with this the spirit of hope be rise for the first time in history a common outlook and common institution be already emerge

 this forward movement be root in the ambition and the interest of asian nation themselves it be precisely this movement that we hope to accelerate when i speak at johns hopkins in baltimore in april 1965 and i pledge a much more massive effort to improve the life of man in that part of the world in the hope that we could take some of the fund that we be spend on bullet and bomb and spend it on school and production

 twenty month later our effort have produce a new reality the door of the billion dollar asian development bank that i recommend to the congress and you endorse almost unanimously i be proud to tell you be already open asians be engage tonight in regional effort in a dozen new direction their hope be high their faith be strong their confidence be deep

 and even as the war continue we shall play our part in carry forward this constructive historic development as recommend by the eugene black mission and if other nation will join we i will seek a special authorization from the congress of $ 200 million for east asian regional program

 we be eager to turn our resource to peace our effort in behalf of humanity i think need not be restrict by any parallel or by any boundary line the moment that peace come as i pledge in baltimore i will ask the congress for fund to join in an international program of reconstruction and development for all the people of vietnam and their deserve neighbor who wish our help

 we shall continue to hope for a reconciliation between the people of mainland china and the world community include work together in all the task of arm control security and progress on which the fate of the chinese people like their fellow man elsewhere depend

 we would be the first to welcome a china which decide to respect her neighbor right we would be the first to applaud she be she to apply her great energy and intelligence to improve the welfare of her people and we have no intention of try to deny her legitimate need for security and friendly relation with her neighboring country

 our hope that all of this will someday happen rest on the conviction that we the american people and our ally will and be go to see vietnam through to an honorable peace

 we will support all appropriate initiative by the united nations and other which can bring the several party together for unconditional discussion of peace anywhere any time and we will continue to take every possible initiative ourselves to constantly probe for peace

 until such effort succeed or until the infiltration cease or until the conflict subside i think the course of wisdom for this country be that we just must firmly pursue our present course we will stand firm in vietnam

 i think you know that our fight man there tonight bear the heavy burden of all with their life they serve their nation we must give they nothing less than our full support and we have give they that nothing less than the determination that americans have always give their fighting man whatever our sacrifice here even if it be more than $ 5 a month it be small compare to their own

 how long it will take i can not prophesy i only know that the will of the american people i think be tonight be test

 whether we can fight a war of limited objective over a period of time and keep alive the hope of independence and stability for people other than ourselves whether we can continue to act with restraint when the temptation to get it over with be invite but dangerous whether we can accept the necessity of choose a great evil in order to ward off a great whether we can do these without arouse the hatred and the passion that be ordinarily loose in time of war on all these question so much turn

 the answer will determine not only where we be but whither we be tend

 a time of testing yes and a time of transition the transition be sometimes slow sometimes unpopular almost always very painful and often quite dangerous

 but we have live with danger for a long time before and we shall live with it for a long time yet to come we know that man be bear unto trouble we also know that this nation be not forge and do not survive and grow and prosper without a great deal of sacrifice from a great many man

 for all the disorder that we must deal with and all the frustration that concern we and all the anxiety that we be call upon to resolve for all the issue we must face with the agony that attend they let we remember that those who expect to reap the blessing of freedom must like man undergo the fatigue of support it

 but let we also count not only our burden but our blessing for they be many

 and let we give thank to the one who govern we all

 let we draw encouragement from the sign of hope for they too be many

 let we remember that we have be test before and america have never be find want

 so with your understanding i would hope your confidence and your support we be go to persist and we be go to succeed



the president good afternoon lady and gentleman

 i have be ask to give a statement about the consular convention that be pende before the united states senate

 i should like to say very briefly that i hope the senate will give its advice and consent to the propose convention with the u.s.s.r. i feel very strongly that the ratification of this treaty be very much in our national interest i feel this way for two principal reason

 first we need this treaty to protect 18,000 american citizen who each year travel from this country to the soviet the convention require immediate notification to we whenever an american be arrest in the soviet union it insure our right to visit that citizen within 4 and as often thereafter as be desirable

 we think that we need these right help to protect american citizen these be right which the soviet citizen already have who travel in this country because guarantee by our constitution

 second the convention do not require the opening of consulate in this country or in the soviet union it do provide that should any such consulate be open the official would have diplomatic immunity

 the secretary of state inform i that no negotiation for consulate be underway and that the most that he can envision in the foreseeable future be the opening of one consulate in each country to be man by from 10 to 15 people

 there be presently 452 soviet official in the united states who have diplomatic immunity if an additional consulate be open and if another 10 be add to the 452 mr. hoover have assure i that this small increment would raise no problem which the fbi can not effectively and efficiently deal with

 in short i think we very much need this convention to protect american interest and to protect american citizen abroad in my judgment it raise no problem with respect to our national security therefore i hope very much that the senate in its wisdom after full debate will see fit to ratify it i will be glad to have any question

 q. we be hear and read and write a good deal lately about diplomacy aim at a vietnam settlement i wonder if you could give we your assessment of the peace front at this time

 the president mr. cormier state a question that i know be on the mind of all the people here today and all the people in this country

 as you know i have underline over and over again the very deep interest of the united states in a prompt and peaceful settlement of all the problem in southeast asia

 i have say many time that we be ready to go more than halfway in achieve this result

 i would remind all of you that we would welcome a conference in southeast asia this might be a geneva conference it could be an all asian conference or any other generally acceptable forum

 we would be glad to see the unconditional discussion to which i refer in my statement of april 1965 at johns hopkins

 we would participate in preliminary discussion which might open the way for formal negotiation

 we be prepare today to talk about mutual step of deescalation

 we would be prepare to talk about such subject as the exchange of prisoner the demilitarization or the demilitarized zone or any other aspect which might take even a small step in the direction of peace

 we would be prepare to discuss any point which the other side wish to bring up along with point which we and our ally very much want to raise ourselves

 or there could be preliminary discussion to see whether there could be an agree set of point which could be the basis for negotiation

 so it be against this background that we study very carefully all of the public statement make which appear from time to time and which bear upon southeast asia and all the view which we receive from or through other government

 it would not be helpful to i and i do not intend to do so to comment on any particular channel or communication at this point but you may be sure that we be diligent in our search for the possibility of peaceful settlement

 in all candor i must say that i be not aware of any serious effort that the other side have make in my judgment to bring the fighting to a stop and to stop the war

 q. mr. president you have be so eloquent in the past about express your desire for peaceful negotiation i would like to ask you whether or not if you think it would speed this war down the road to peace you would be willing personally to participate in negotiation with some of your opposite number such as the leadership in hanoi

 the president we have make clear that if the other side desire to discuss peace at any time we will be very happy to have appropriate arrangement make to see that that be carry out

 where we would talk who would talk what we would talk about be all matter that could be work out between the two government involve

 we have make clear to they and to the world the principle that we believe must govern a peace meeting of this kind and a settlement that we would hope would come out of it the honoring of the geneva accord of 1954 and 1962 the right of self determination for the people of south vietnam to insure that they be free from the threat or use of force

 but we have i must say as of today no indication that the other side be prepare in any way to settle on these limited and decent term

 we hope very much that we can have some signal in that direction but i in candor must say that as of now we do not have

 q. mr. president do your express willingness to negotiate a peaceful settlement imply any willingness to compromise on any of our state objective in that part of the world

 the president i think that any peace agreement will involve understanding on both part and certain concession on both part and certain understanding i do not think that we can determine those before we come together or through any press conference technique

 i can only repeat what i say in the state of the union that i wish that the conflict in vietnam be over

 and i can only repeat what i have say so many time i will do anything i can the part of this government to go more than halfway to bring it to an end

 i must say that we face great cost we face agony we do plan to carry out our effort out there we be go to support our troop in the field we be go to work with our vietnamese ally toward pacification and constitutional government

 while we be do that every hour of every day the spokesman for this government be under instruction to explore every possibility for peace

 but i do not want to disillusion any of you and i do not want any of you to be catch by speculation as of this moment i can not report that there be any serious indication that the other side be ready to stop the war

 q. you have three time now use phrase no serious effort by the other to bring the war to a close

 how would you characterize what have be go on in the last couple of week do you recognize any sign of maneuverability or fluidity in their position

 the president i see almost every day some speculation by some individual or some hope or desire express by some government and i assume that different individual get different impression certainly they have different hope i can only speak for myself john and with the information that i have with the knowledge that be bring to i i must say that i do not interpret any action that i have observe as be a serious effort to either go to a conference table or to bring the war to an end

 q. mr. president could you give we your assessment of how recent event in china may be affect the chance for peace in vietnam

 first of all your assessment of what be happen in china and then how you think that may affect the chance of a peace

 the president i think that there be little i can add to what the general public know about the event in china i think that we all know that they be have very serious problem

 and i would not think that would add anything to the strength of our adversary in that area i think that we can see from some of the problem that we have ourselves from time to time that unity be very important in connection with our operation

 and i do not see that the difference in china be go to contribute anything to the strength of the north vietnamese

 on the other hand i do not want to hold out any hope to you that i do not have myself and i can not say at this moment that the event in china be go to contribute immediately to the end of the war in vietnam

 q. mr. president would you discuss the report that there have be a decline in the infiltration rate to the south to say whether you think the bombing have have any effect on this

 the president i state in my baltimore speech in early 1965 what we expect to come from the bombing

 we feel that it would improve the morale of the people in south vietnam who feel that they have almost lose the war

 we feel that it would make the north vietnamese pay a much heavy price for what they be do

 and we feel that it would make the infiltration more difficult

 we think it have achieve all of those express purpose

 we can not speak with cold assurance on the infiltration and the number each day or each week or each month

 in some quarter of the year our indication be that they increase in other period of the year the next quarter they may go down some

 i know of nothing that i can conclude as highly significant from the guess and the estimate that we have make

 q. mr. president we have say in the past that we would be willing to suspend the bombing of north vietnam in exchange for some suitable step by the other side be you prepared at all to tell we what kind of other step the other side should take for this suspension of bombing

 the president just almost any step

 as far as we can see they have not take any yet

 and we would be glad to explore any reciprocal action that they or any of their spokesman would care to suggest

 we have make one proposal after the other we would like to have a cease fire we would be very glad to stop our bombing as we have on two previous occasion if we could have any indication of reciprocal action

 but as of now they have give none and i assume they be willing to give none until i hear far

 q. mr. president last fall your image be describe in some very harsh term some see it as arrogant and not to be believe but lately these term have switch to something much more sympathetic and you have be see lately by many as an underdog

 you have be president for more than 3 year how do you feel about the job and if you can bear to tell we how do you feel about we in the press

 the president well i have not give a lot of thought to you in the press we have our problem with the press twice a day at our regular briefing i try to meet with they at least twice a month in some manner and almost every day i see a collection of they on one subject or the other about something that interest they

 i think our system require that and i always try to reciprocate their understanding

 now as for be president i can only add to what i say the first day i be in this office i be go to do the very good i can i need all the help that i can get i think the country and the congress and the other nation of the world have be very willing to be reasonable in their relation with i

 i think all in all we have succeed in obtain some of our objective

 i go to bed every night feel that i have fail that day because i could not end the conflict in vietnam

 i do have disappointment and moment of distress as i think every president have have

 but i be not complain

 and if you can endure it in the press i will try to endure it in the presidency

 q. have you be able to take a reading of the new congress be it perceptively more conservative than the last one

 the president yes i think it be quite a different congress i think it be go to be a more partisan congress and i think that it be go to be more difficult to obtain favorable action on administration measure i say after the first congress after the election in 1964 that the president 's mandate rarely last long than 6 month and i hope that we could get most of the pledge we make in our platform enact as soon as possible

 i have never tabulate it but i believe senator mansfield make the statement that the congress have enact about 85 percent of our platform

 we still have some other thing to pass we will win some and we will lose some we will try to work out an area of agreement where we can take some modify language in certain legislation we have to pass

 i do not want to anticipate more difficulty than i need to

 i be go to do with the congress like i be try to do with our adversary in other place in the world i be go to say to the minority party which i do think appear to be able to find fault with almost our every act that i want to meet they halfway and i want their cooperation i want their help because i do not believe it be good for the country to have partisan political in fight all the time we ought to reserve a few week before the election for that and then all of we work for america the rest of the time

 i hope and believe that most member of the congress will feel that way

 q. mr. president for some time you have be talk about build bridge to the country of eastern europe despite the appeal of this government the czechoslovakian government have sentence an american citizen to what we believe to be a rather harsh punishment

 how do this affect your thinking on build these bridge to the communist eastern european country

 the president there be many obstacle that come in the way in our attempt to reach all of our objective i regret very much the incident to which your refer i be very hopeful that the government concern will take appropriate just and fair action

 i be still determined that notwithstanding some difficulty that may arise from time to time that this be in the overall good interest of this country and i be go to continue to try to work toward that goal

 q. mr. president the foreign minister in north vietnam have say that if the united states stop bomb the north

 would you consider a mere willingness to talk peace to be enough of a step on their part to halt bombing or would some military move be necessary

 the president i have see nothing that any of they have say that indicate any seriousness on their part i be await any offer they might care to make

 they know that we be in contact with they i can not speak for they but i be very anxious for they to make any proposal and we will give it very prompt and serious consideration

 q. recently expert have testify at the senate foreign relations committee that the whole threat of communism have change a great deal since world war i and that it be quite a different picture now do you agree that the communist threat be sufficiently different

 the president yes we still have our problem but i think they change from time to time and i think there have be material change in the thinking of various country and their approach to their relation to other nation since world war ii

 i be very hopeful that we can continue to try to evolve a satisfactory formula for get along in this world and i be encourage in that hope every day i see more encouraging sign than i do discourage one along that line

 q. since the election of last november a number of governors and other people have criticize the effort or lack of effort of the democratic party and the national committee

 when mr. staebler leave the white house the other day he say important thing be happen within the national committee

 can you tell we what be happen within the democratic party

 the president i do not see mr. staebler i do not know what he refer to i think he would be a well person to make that reply than i be

 the democratic national committee have a very competent chairman vice chairman chairman of the finance committee and the deputy chairman all of those people be in the committee when i come into the presidency while they have only have one national campaign since that time it be very satisfactory so far as i be concern

 and i think some people have use the committee as a kind of whipping boy some of they that really do not understand the function of the committee i have work on both the national committee as an officer and the congressional committee as an officer for many year

 it have never be the function of the national committee to take over the congressional election we support they we work with they we aid they every way we can in the national committee

 but there be not many congressman that want the democratic national chairman to manage their campaign in their local district and for that reason we have a congressional committee and we have a senatorial committee

 it be my judgment that those committee be well run well operate they do a good job this year and i know the democratic national committee give they more support and more assistance and more effort than we have give in any period in our history

 so i do not know exactly what they be refer to i think if they have a knowledge of the situation they would not feel as badly as they do about the present membership

 thank you mr. president





the president good afternoon lady and gentleman

 i be send a message to the congress this afternoon ask it to act speedily to restore the investment credit and the use of accelerated depreciation for building i be ask that this be make effective as of today

 you will recall that last fall when i sign the legislation temporarily suspend these investment incentive i say then and i should like to quote now

 the legislation which i have sign provide for automatic restoration of these special tax provision in january 1968 if however any early reinstatement would be appropriate i shall recommend prompt legislative action to accomplish that result

 that action be appropriate today and i be so recommend action today

 both the house and senate committee which consider this legislation recognize the need to restore these incentive promptly once the suspension be no long necessary

 it be now clear that the temporary suspension of these investment incentive have do the job that we hope and expect it would do

 interest rate begin to decline last september immediately after this proposal be first submit to the congress since then aid by action of the federal reserve board interest rate have come down as much as 1 1/4 percentage point from their september peak treasury bill rate be down from 5.59 percent in september to 4.34 percent yesterday interest rate on new municipal bond be down from 4.24 percent in september to 3.60 percent now

 last spring and summer saving and loan association have virtually no new money whatever to lend to home builder and home buyer in the past 4 month they have be take in deposit at a normal rate and again have money to lend so we be begin to revive the homebuilding industry

 since the recommendation be make last september the excessive pressure on our machinery industry have we think ease very dramatically

 --after rise 28 percent from september 1965 to september 1966 order backlog for capital good have now already level off and actually decline in january for the first time in more than 3 year

 --last september the machinery producer be operate close to 100 percent of capacity now their operation have move down to a much healthy and much more efficient rate

 --the acute shortage of skilled machinist have now greatly moderated

 --import of capital equipment which have previously be climb on an average of 14 percent a quarter have already level off

 so this evidence of moderation in our economy have now be confirm by the survey of investment plan for 1967 conduct by the department of commerce and the securities and exchange commission which be release to you yesterday and publish this morning

 a moderate increase of 3.9 percent in capital outlay be plan for 1967 accord to these estimate that be a very sharp contrast to the increase of 16 percent and 17 percent in the past 2 year

 so the action that we take last fall with the cooperation of the congress have help to do what we think very much need to be do

 the imbalance in our economy that we be aim at have now be right

 we say that we would restore the tax incentive when appropriate and when the suspension be no long need

 the suspension be no long need i propose that we restore the investment incentive effective today

 i will be glad to take any question

 q. mr. president in view of the recent statement and speech which either differ with your vietnam policy or suggest major change in it be you consider any effort to de escalate these apparent difference with such people as the senators kennedy and people who believe as they do

 the president mr. smith we have help and suggestion from member of the senate and from leader in public life throughout the nation and throughout the world

 i think all of we be very anxious to seek a peaceful settlement in vietnam

 as far as i be concern the soon the well

 we be ready to use any procedure that the other side be willing to engage in

 we have state our position a good many time the machinery of the geneva conference the united nations an all asian conference or any other appropriate forum

 individual have different approach to this matter

 i have the benefit of a worldwide network of train diplomat

 i have the experience of the joint chiefs of staff

 i have the judgment and recommendation of the cabinet the secretary of state and secretary of defense

 i have constant consultation with our ally in the world in particular our ally engage with we in vietnam

 on the basis of that information i must make judgment and i do sometimes those judgment be different from what other people if they be in this position would make

 i have no particular fault to find or criticism to make of other i just must act in the light of the information i have exercise the good judgment i can and do what i think be good for this country that be what i be do without regard to personality or politic

 q. mr. president do you think still that an income tax increase on july i will be necessary

 the president yes we have recommend a 6 percent surcharge we see no reason to change that recommendation

 the ways and means committee be now busy consider legislation involve matter of deep concern to the administration such as the social security bill

 we think by the time they get to hearing on the tax bill the administration will be able to make a very good case base on the economy base on all the factor that that committee must consider

 there be some doubt in congress about the wisdom of it we will have to debate those out

 as of this time i would see no reason why we should change the recommendation we make in our state of the union message

 q. what be your reaction sir to the statement by arthur schlesinger jr. yesterday to the effect that your administration do not really want negotiation concern vietnam at this time

 the president i have try to make it abundantly clear to all the people of this country and all of the people of the world that we be prepared to talk without condition we be prepared to talk about condition or we will talk about a final settlement

 i say to you i think the last time we meet that this government be always willing anxious and eager to go more than halfway but i must call to the attention of you and the american people that i do not think that we can stop half the war while the other side continue to kill our man to lob their mortar into our air basis to seize south vietnam by force

 i just must repeat each day that we be ready to speak unconditionally or conditionally the problem with all of those who love peace and i think most of we do be not with this government we be willing to go to a conference room any day we be ready to go without stop or after stop if they be willing to do likewise or if they be willing to make any concession

 but i do not think it be fair to ask an american commander in chief to say to your man ground your plane tie your hand behind you sit there and watch division after division come across the dmz and do not hit they until they get within a mile or two of you

 i do not think that be fair to american marines or american soldier

 we have talk before while act of war continue we do that in korea we have the blockade on in berlin while we have conference

 so we be willing to talk unconditionally or we be willing to talk conditionally all we ask be equity and fairness and that the other side do likewise we do not think you ought to ask the american boy to do one thing while other folk do nothing

 q. mr. president have the vietnam situation reach a stage where you and your adviser feel that time be now increasingly on our side

 the president i think it be very difficult to speculate and give you a direct reply to that question i think our man have give a very wonderful account of themselves

 i no long see any possibility of a military victory on the part of north vietnam i think they realize it i think they be struggle desperately today to try to get a propaganda victory and to try to bring world opinion and public opinion in this country to permit they to win here what they can not win from our man out there

 q. mr. president there be report that ambassador lodge would like to be relieve of his post and that you be look for a successor be there any truth to these report

 the president no there be no truth that i be look for a successor

 ambassador lodge have talk to i on several occasion that he in due time would leave his post he leave it on one other occasion take a rest and go back and serve a tour of duty

 there be no definite date set at this moment for his departure i do expect to be visit with ambassador lodge and with general westmoreland as we do from time to time

 we will fully explore his future in vietnam or elsewhere if he care to do that

 q. mr. president vice president humphrey have say that he be not happy with what the cia have be do in relation to financing student and other group what he say do that reflect your view

 the president i do not think any of we be happy to see our nation divide and see our country upset about situation such as mr. katzenbach be now study

 i think it would be well for all of we if we be unite and if all of we could agree upon a wise course of action and be free of any mistake any error

 i regret very much some of the intemperate statement and some of the severe criticism that have be make about various government agency include the central intelligence agency i have ask the good people in the government to study everything they have do and to make a report to i i expect to receive that report sometime perhaps by the middle or the 20th of the month

 then i will review it and make such decision as may be indicate

 q. mr. president sir one point that some of your critic on vietnam have discuss in the past week be the question of whether or not what we would ask in return for stop the bombing have change in the past year

 they say that a year ago apparently we would have settle for simply get talk if we stop whereas now you be speak of the need for reciprocal military action could you discuss this

 the president we have talk about reciprocal military action in every pause we have have mr. bailey

 we have have five pause now

 on the first pause of 5 day we make it very clear that we be take this action and we would keep our ear to the receiver and listen intently for any indication from the enemy that he would take reciprocal action

 he turn our letter back to we on the third day of that pause

 later we have a 37 day pause we be tell before we go into that pause by some of the same people who be recommend a pause now or urge a pause now that if we would go into it for 12 day or at the most 20 day we could get reciprocal action

 we make it very clear that we would take the initiative and we would try to see if they be willing to pick up the telephone

 we go 37 day they give we no indication that they be willing to take any reciprocal action

 we have just finish a pause of 6 day during the tet period

 at the beginning of each of these pause we make it clear that we be go to pause ask our man to withhold action and give they an opportunity to agree to come to conditional discussion unconditional discussion any kind of discussion we have just complete that 6 day pause

 so i would respond to your question by say at the beginning of each pause we make it clear that we would take action we would listen intently for action on their part we have we have hear the same story every time

 i see nothing in any evidence that i have that would give i any indication that they have have a change of mind or that they be willing to take any serious action to stop this war

 i be search every day i be follow every lead i can i hope that we will find something at the beginning of every week but i can not give you any assurance now

 q. mr. president sir in view of what mr. kosygin say after the truce end and in view of what mr. podgorny have say as recently as today do you still believe the russians genuinely want peace in vietnam

 the president yes i believe that the russians genuinely want peace i think that most people in the world want peace some want it on different term

 i be hope that the day will come when we can find some area of agreement but i do not think that that day be here yet we will just continue to try

 q. mr. president mr. martin 's term as chairman of the federal reserve board expire at the end of this month can you tell we sir whether you have be pleased with the recent policy of the federal reserve and whether you intend to reappoint mr. martin

 the president i think that it be evident from my statement that first i think it be generally know that i be glad that interest rate have fall and have come down i think it be clear that they have be reduce from one half of a percent in some instance to 1 1/4 percent in other

 i say in my statement today that that be in part due to the action of the federal reserve board

 i be pleased with the action the chairman and other member of the board take that contribute to that

 q. mr. president there have be a public quarrel over the word permanent insofar as the bombing be concern the russians be say not to be use that word and hanoi have be say to insist upon it

 i wonder if you could straighten we out as to whether hanoi be demand a permanent end or simply an unconditional halt in the bombing

 the president i do not want to quarrel with anyone i think it be rather dear to i that they have lay down condition that to i mean that they insist that we agree to permanent cessation of bombing before they might talk

 q. mr. president you and secretary rusk have both talk of a military quid pro quo and reciprocal action in exchange for a halt in the bombing i wonder if you could be specific and say what we would require from the other side as part of this quid pro quo

 the president i think a good general way to express it be what i say at my last press conference just almost any reciprocal action on their part we have say that we would be glad to stop our invasion of north vietnam if they would stop their invasion of south vietnam

 we would be glad to halt our bombing if they would halt their aggression and their infiltration we be prepared to discuss anything that they be willing to discuss but they be not willing to discuss anything as of now

 q. mr. president i know you believe in reciprocity i wonder if you have be able to get the russians to give we any promise we be make so many promise and overture to they with good will and desire for concession

 the president yes we have reach an agreement that be satisfactory to we and in our national interest in a number of field i do not think that i should take your time to enumerate they but the consular agreement be one that be now be debate cultural exchange be another the space agreement be another

 we be work very diligently although we do not know what result will be forthcoming in connection with the nonproliferation treaty discussion will soon begin in connection with offensive and defensive nuclear weapon ambassador thompson will participate in those discussion in moscow

 we have exchange idea and view and reach agreement to the benefit of both country and both people

 q. i wonder if you could deal with two point on the draft your advisory commission suggest that the negro and other minority group be get a poor shake in many area of this country in military policy they also suggest that in addition to the random selection system that you have now endorse that you overhaul the whole selective service procedure

 tell we first whether you think the overhaul be necessary to correct the situation for minority and secondly why the random system seem to be draw so much opposition

 the president well i can not speak for the opposition i can only speak for myself it have be many year since we have a thorough study of the draft such as we have have very recently by two distinguished panel the marshall commission and the general clark commission

 i think they make many good recommendation i think there will be more yet to come that will flow from the debate in the congress unquestionably in the field of the selective service board and the draft machinery as in the general machinery of government at all level there have be discrimination against minority group i will do all i can to see that that be correct i do not believe our people want to see that happen or want to see that continue

 i expect that the system now be work on by general hershey and secretary mcnamara when we issue our executive order will be a fair and impartial random selection

 i realize that there be differ opinion we will hear much of they during the extensive debate but generally speak i agree with the conclusion reach by mr. marshall and his commission i state this in my message to the congress i want to hear the debate on the student deferment matter from both side the commission be divide on that question and then i will reach a decision when the congress have have a chance to act

 q. mr. president ted sorenson contend that it would be break historical precedent for you as a president who succeed to office to seek a second full term

 would you end all this speculation for we and tell we a if you intend to run in 1968 and b if hubert humphrey will be your run mate

 the president i do not know miss means there have be that much speculation about it

 i be not ready to make a decision about my future after january of 1969 at this time i think that down the road several month from now would be the appropriate time for an announcement of my future plan

 i have never know a public servant that i work well with or for whom i have more admiration or who i think be more entitled to the public trust than the vice president i feel that way when i ask the convention in atlantic city to select he i feel even strong about it today

 q. mr. president david lilienthal and robert komer recently report to you on the other war in vietnam as i understand it they say that there be substantial progress in establish a constitutional democracy they report economic progress in fact i gather the only place we be not make any progress be in the propaganda war

 but their report seem to be so different from what we be hear on radio and television i do not know if it be at variance or just exactly how to describe it can you tell we how you appraise the other war and why so little be know about it

 the president well i be not sure that president be objective viewer or listener

 i recall some very distinguished president not many year ago say he be read more and more and like it less and less i guess all president feel that way the long they be in office

 i do think that mr. komer bring back an optimistic appraisal of the situation in vietnam i think that we have make great progress there it have be only 18 month since we send our troop there

 i do not think we can expect any quick overnight success story

 i will be receive a report sometime later this month from both general westmoreland in person and from ambassador lodge and from mr. porter and all of those engage in vietnam

 we meet about every 6 month we will review in some detail our weakness out there and they be legion as well as our strength

 i be very proud of what the united states government have be able to do in the last 18 month in that area

 i be very sure of victory i be very grateful to the man who be make sacrifice to bring it about

 q. mr. president have you make any decision on the west coast strike against 13 shipyard

 the president yes i have order a directive prepare the lawyer be work on it now perhaps the secretary be type it i will send later today a directive to the attorney general to proceed on a taft hartley injunction

 i think as you know the federal mediation and conciliation service over the past 4 month have work rather intensively but they have be unable to resolve this very difficult labor dispute

 the secretaries of defense and labor and the attorney general have recommend that i establish an emergency board

 i understand the attorney general will very likely go to court in san francisco perhaps tomorrow morning on the matter

 q. mr. president two point on vietnam do you think the critic of your policy particularly those critic within your own party be base their criticism on misinformation and second at what point would you activate the pledge that you just reiterate a moment ago of go more than halfway for peace or do you feel you have already go more than halfway

 the president just at any point that i have an opportunity that i have a signal from the other side of what their intention be what they be willing to do

 they have take a rather steadfast position there have be little flexibility in it if i could get any sign from they or any indication from they that they be anxious to stop the war that they be serious about it that they be willing to talk unconditionally or conditionally i would act very promptly

 second so far as the critic of the vietnam situation be concern i must grant to they the same sincerity that i reserve for myself

 now as to the extent of their information i think that vary i think some man have more than other some man have more opportunity to have it than other

 i be just not in a position to know how much information each critic of my policy in vietnam happen to have at the time he make his criticism

 i might say that it seem obvious to i that some of they do need more information sometimes because when they make suggestion follow a course of action that we have just complete it make i wish that all this information be available to everybody who be assume responsibility in the matter

 q. mr. president be ambassador lodge and general westmoreland come here for a conference

 the president no i expect we will meet they in the pacific area somewhere i would expect it would be perhaps sometime this month

 q. mr. president be there any information you have from the space agency sir on whether our goal of land man on the moon in 1970 will be alter because of the apollo tragedy

 the president i have have report from they i think we have a very difficult undertaking i think it have be a very close question since the original target date be set

 i be very hopeful we will be able to keep it i do not think there be any guarantee that we will at all

 q. mr. president some question have arise about lightweight rifle that have be send to neutral singapore on a straight sale basis while our korean ally in vietnam have be urge the united states to provide some

 can you tell we if this have come to your attention

 the president yes our people be always very anxious that every one of our man have the good and most modern equipment available at all time i have scrupulously inquire of general westmoreland if our man be short of any supply or any equipment at any time he have assure i that they have be amply equip and amply take care of

 we have from time to time help other nation some of the equipment we have have have go to they

 whether or not any equipment that have go to they be desperately need in any other theater i would doubt

 i think that we can rely on commander of the stature of general westmoreland i think he be close to the scene i think he know more about it i think he be a well authority

 while i do not question either the purpose or the sincerity of the individual who assume to make suggestion in this area and i will carefully consider they at the present time i be go to rely on general westmoreland 's judgment unless somebody give i something well

 thank you mr. president





lieutenant governor gorrell speaker cummings governor ellington distinguished member of the legislature and my friend

 it be always a very special privilege and pleasure for i to visit tennessee

 for a texan it be like homecoming because much of the courage and the hard work that go into the building of the southwest come from the hill and the field of tennessee it strengthen the sinew of thousand of man at the alamo at san jacinto and at the home of our pioneer people

 this morning i visit the hermitage the historic home of andrew jackson two century have pass since that most american of all americans be bear the world have change a great deal since his day but the quality which sustain man and nation in position of leadership have not change

 in our time as in andrew jackson 's freedom have its price

 in our time as in his history conspire to test the american will

 in our time as in jackson 's time courage and vision and the willingness to sacrifice will sustain the cause of freedom

 this generation of americans be make its imprint on history it be make it in the fierce hill and the swelter jungle of vietnam i think most of our citizen have after a very penetrate debate which be our democratic heritage reach a common understanding on the meaning and on the objective of that struggle

 before i discuss the specific question that remain at issue i should like to review the point of widespread agreement

 it be 2 year ago that we be force to choose force to make a decision between major commitment in defense of south vietnam or retreat the evacuation of more than 25,000 of our troop the collapse of the republic of vietnam in the face of subversion and external assault

 andrew jackson would never have be surprise at the choice we make

 we choose a course in keep with american tradition in keep with the foreign policy of at least three administration with the express will of the congress of the united states with our solemn obligation under the southeast asian treaty and with the interest of 16 million south vietnamese who have no wish to live under communist domination

 as our commitment in vietnam require more man and more equipment some voice be raise in opposition the administration be urge to disengage to find an excuse to abandon the effort

 these cry come despite grow evidence that the defense of vietnam hold the key to the political and economic future of free asia the stake of the struggle grow correspondingly

 it become clear that if we be prepared to stay the course in vietnam we could help to lay the cornerstone for a diverse and independent asia full of promise and resolute in the cause of peaceful economic development for her long suffer people

 but if we falter the force of chaos would scent victory and decade of strife and aggression would stretch endlessly before we

 the choice be clear we would stay the course and we shall stay the course

 i think most americans support this fundamental decision most of we remember the fearful cost of ignore aggression most of we have cast aside the illusion that we can live in an affluent fortress while the world slide into chaos

 i think we have all reach broad agreement on our basic objective in vietnam

 first an honorable peace that will leave the people of south vietnam free to fashion their own political and economic institution without fear of terror or intimidation from the north

 second a southeast asia in which all country include a peaceful north vietnam apply their scarce resource to the real problem of their people combat hunger ignorance and disease

 i have say many many time that nothing would give we great pleasure than to invest our own resource in the constructive work of peace rather than in the futile destruction of war

 third a concrete demonstration that aggression across international frontier or demarcation line be no long an acceptable mean of political change

 there be also i think a general agreement among americans on the thing that we do not want in vietnam

 we do not want permanent basis we will begin with the withdrawal of our troop on a reasonable schedule whenever reciprocal concession be forthcoming from our adversary

 we do not seek to impose our political belief upon south vietnam our republic rest upon a brisk commerce in idea we will be happy to see free competition in the intellectual marketplace whenever north vietnam be willing to shift the conflict from the battlefield to the ballot box

 so these be the broad principle on which most americans agree

 on a less general level however the event and frustration of these past few difficult week have inspire a number of question about our vietnam policy in the mind and heart of a good many of our citizen today here in this historic chamber i want to deal with some of those question that figure most prominently in the press and in some of the letter which reach a president 's desk

 many americans be confuse by the barrage of information about military engagement they long for the capsule summary which have keep tab on our previous war a line on the map that divide friend from foe

 precisely what they ask be our military situation and what be the prospect of victory

 the first answer be that vietnam be aggression in a new guise as far remove from trench warfare as the rifle from the longbow this be a war of infiltration of subversion of ambush pitch battle be very rare and even more rarely be they decisive

 today more than 1 million man from the republic of vietnam and its six ally be engage in the order of battle

 despite continue increase in north vietnam infiltration this strengthening of ally force in 1966 under the brilliant leadership of general westmoreland be instrumental in reverse the whole course of this war

 --we estimate that 55,000 north vietnamese and vietcong be kill in 1966 compare with 35,000 the previous year many more be wound and more than 20,000 defect

 --by contrast 9,500 south vietnamese more than 5,000 americans and 600 from other ally force be kill in action

 --the vietnamese army achieve a 1966 average of two weapon capture from the vietcong to every one lose a dramatic turn around from the previous 2 year

 --allied force have make several successful sweep through territory that be formerly consider vietcong sanctuarie only a short time ago these operation not only cost the enemy large number of man and weapon but be very damaging to his morale

 well what do all of this mean will the north vietnamese change their tactic will there be less infiltration of main unit will there be more of guerrilla warfare

 the actual truth be we just do not know what we do know be that general westmoreland 's strategy be produce result that our military situation have substantially improve that our military success have permit the groundwork to be lay for a pacification program which be the long run key to an independent south vietnam

 since february 1965 our military operation have include selective bombing of military target in north vietnam our purpose be three

 --to back our fight man by deny the enemy a sanctuary

 --to exact a penalty against north vietnam for her flagrant violation of the geneva accord of 1954 and 1962

 --to limit the flow or to substantially increase the cost of infiltration of man and material from north vietnam

 all of our intelligence confirm that we have be successful

 yet some of our people object strongly to this aspect of our policy must we bomb many people ask do it do any military good be it consistent with america 's limited objective be it an inhuman act that be aim at civilian

 on the question of military utility i can only report the firm belief of the secretary of defense the joint chiefs of staff the central intelligence agency general westmoreland and our commander in the field and all the course of information and advice available to the commander in chief and that be that the bombing be cause serious disruption and be bring about add burden to the north vietnamese infiltration effort

 we know for example that half a million people be keep busy just repair damage to bridge road railroad and other strategic facility and in air and coastal defense and repair of powerplant

 i also want to say categorically that it be not the position of the american government that the bombing will be decisive in get hanoi to abandon aggression it have however create very serious problem for they the good indication of how substantial be the fact that they be work so hard every day with all their friend throughout the world to try to get we to stop

 the bombing be entirely consistent with america 's limited objective in south vietnam the strength of communist main force unit in the south be clearly base on their infiltration from the north so i think it be simply unfair to our american soldier sailor and marine and our vietnamese ally to ask they to face increase enemy personnel and firepower without make an effort to try to reduce that infiltration

 now as to bomb civilian i would simply say that we be make an effort that be unprecedented in the history of warfare to be sure that we do not it be our policy to bomb military target only

 we have never deliberately bomb city nor attack any target with the purpose of inflict civilian casualty

 we hasten to add however that we recognize and we regret that some people even after warning be live and work in the vicinity of military target and they have suffer

 we be also too aware that man and machine be not infallible and that some mistake do occur

 but our record on this account be in my opinion highly defensible

 look for a moment at the record of the other side

 any civilian casualty that result from our operation be inadvertent in stark contrast to the calculated vietcong policy of systematic terror

 ten of thousand of innocent vietnamese civilian have be kill torture and kidnap by the vietcong there be no doubt about the deliberate nature of the vietcong program one need only note the frequency with which vietcong victim be village leader teacher health worker and other who be try to carry out constructive program for their people

 yet the deed of the vietcong go largely unnoted in the public debate it be this moral double bookkeeping which make we get sometimes very weary of our critic

 but there be another question that we should answer why do not we stop bomb to make it easy to begin negotiation the answer be a simple one

 --we stop for 5 day and 20 hour in may 1965 representative of hanoi simply return our message in a plain envelope

 --we stop bombing for 36 day and 15 hot rs in december 1965 and january 1966 hanoi only reply a political settlement of the vietnam problem can be envisage only when the united states government have accept the four point stand of the government of the democratic republic of vietnam have prove this by actual deed have stop unconditionally and for good its air raid and all other act of war against the democratic republic of vietnam

 --and only last month we stop bomb for 5 day and 18 hour after many prior week in which we have communicate to they several possible route to peace any one of which america be prepared to take their response as you know deliver to his holiness the pope be this the united states must put an end to their aggression in vietnam end unconditionally and definitively the bombing and all other act of war against the democratic republic of vietnam withdraw from south vietnam all american and satellite troop recognize the south vietnamese national front for liberation and let the vietnamese people settle themselves their own affair that be where we stand today

 they have three time reject a bombing pause as a means to open the way to end the war and go to the negotiate table

 the tragedy of south vietnam be not limit to casualty list

 there be much tragedy in the story of a nation at war for nearly a generation it be the story of economic stagnation it be the story of a generation of young man the flower of the labor force press into military service by one side or the other

 no one deny that the survival of south vietnam be heavily dependent upon early economic progress

 my most recent and my most hopeful report of progress in this area come from an old friend of tennessee of the tennessee valley authority david lilienthal who recently go as my representative to vietnam to begin to work with the vietnamese people on economic planning for that area

 he report and with some surprise i might add that he discover an extraordinary air of confidence among the farmer and the village leader and the trade unionist and the industrialist he conclude that their economic behavior suggest and i quote he that they think that they know how this be all go to come out

 mr. lilienthal also say that the south vietnamese be among the hard work people that he have see in develop country around the world that to have be through 20 year of war and still have this amount of zip almost ensure their long term economic development

 mr. lilienthal will be go with i to guam saturday night to talk with our new leader about the plan that he will try to institute there

 our aid program be support the drive toward this sound economy

 but none of these economic accomplishment will be decisive by itself and no economic achievement can substitute for a strong and free political structure

 we can not build such a structure because only the vietnamese can do that

 and i think they be build it as i be talk to you here a freely elect constituent assembly in saigon be now wrestle with the last detail of a new constitution one which will bring the republic of vietnam to full membership among the democratic nation of the world

 we expect that constitution to be complete this month

 in the midst of war they have be build for peace and justice that be a remarkable accomplishment in the annal of mankind

 ambassador henry cabot lodge who have serve we with such great distinction be come to the end of his second distinguished tour of duty in saigon

 to replace he i be draft as our ambassador to the government of vietnam mr. ellsworth bunker able and devoted full of wisdom and experience acquire on five continent over many year

 as his deputy i be nominate and recall from pakistan mr. eugene locke our young and very vigorous ambassador to pakistan

 to drive forward with a sense of urgency in our work in pacification i be send the president 's special assistant mr. robert komer

 to strengthen general westmoreland in the intense operation that he will be conduct in the month ahead i be assign to he additional topflight military personnel the good that this country have be able to produce

 so you can be confident that in the month ahead we shall have at work in saigon the able the wise the most tenacious and the most experienced team that the united states of america can mount

 in view of these decision and in view of the meeting that will take place this weekend i think it wise to invite the leader of south vietnam to join we in guam for a part of our discussion if it be convenient for they i be gratified to be inform that they have accept our invitation

 i should also like for you to know that the representative of all the country that be contribute troop in vietnam will be come to washington for april 20 and 21 meeting for a general appraisal of the situation that exist

 now this bring i to my final point the peaceful and just world that we all seek

 we have just live through another flurry of rumor of peace feeler

 our year of deal with this problem have teach we that peace will not come easily

 the problem be a very simple one it take two to negotiate at a peace table and hanoi have just simply refuse to consider come to a peace table

 i do not believe that our own position on peace negotiation can be state any more clearly than i have state it many time in the past or than the distinguished secretary of state mr. rusk or ambassador goldberg or any number of other official have state it in every forum that we could find

 i do want to repeat to you this afternoon and through you to the people of america the essential now lest there be any doubt

 --unite states representative be ready at any time for discussion of the vietnam problem or any related matter with any government or government if there be any reason to believe that these discussion will in any way seriously advance the cause of peace

 --we be prepared to go more than halfway and to use any avenue possible to encourage such discussion and we have do that at every opportunity

 we believe that the geneva accord of 1954 and 1962 could serve as the central element of a peaceful settlement these accord provide in essence that both south and north vietnam should be free from external interference while at the same time they would be free independently to determine their position on the question of reunification

 we also stand ready to advance toward a reduction of hostility without prior agreement the road to peace could go from deed to discussion or it could start with discussion and go to deed

 we be ready to take either route we be ready to move on both of they

 but reciprocity must be the fundamental principle of any reduction in hostility the united states can not and will not reduce its activity unless and until there be some reduction on the other side to follow any other rule would be to violate the trust that we undertake when we ask a man to risk his life for his country

 we will negotiate a reduction of the bombing whenever the government of north vietnam be ready and there be almost innumerable avenue of communication by which the government of north vietnam can make their readiness know

 to this date and this hour there have be no sign of that readiness

 yet we must and we will keep on try

 as i speak to you today secretary rusk and our representative throughout the world be on a constant alert hundred and hundred of quiet diplomatic conversation free from the glare of front page headline or of klieg light be be hold and they will be hold on the possibility of bring peace to vietnam

 governor averell harriman with 25 year of experience of troubleshoot on the most difficult international problem that america have ever have be carry out my instruction that every possible lead however slight it may first appear from any source public or private shall be follow up

 let i conclude by say this i so much wish that it be within my power to assure that all those in hanoi could hear one simple message america be commit to the defense of south vietnam until an honorable peace can be negotiate

 if this one communication get through and its rational implication be draw we should be at the table tomorrow it would be none too soon for we then hundred of thousand of americans as brave as any who ever take the field for their country could come back home

 and the man who could lead they back be the man that you train and send from here our own beloved brilliant general westy westmoreland as these hero come back to their home million of vietnamese could begin to make a decent life for themselves and their family without fear of terrorism without fear of war or without fear of communist enslavement

 that be what we be work and what we be fight for we must not we shall not and we will not fail

 thank you

in the early morning today governor romney communicate with attorney general ramsey clark and tell he of the extreme disorder in detroit michigan the attorney general keep i advise throughout the morning
 at 10:56 this morning i receive a wire from governor romney officially request that federal troop be dispatch to michigan this wire have be send at 10:46 a.m.
 at 11:02 a.m. this morning i instruct the secretary of defense mr. mcnamara to initiate the movement of the troop which the governor have request
 at the same time i advise the governor by telegram that the troop would be send to selfridge air base just northeast of detroit and would be available to support and to assist the some 8,000 michigan national guardsmen and the several thousand state and local police under the command of governor romney and the mayor of detroit i inform the governor that these troop would arrive this afternoon
 i also inform the governor that immediately mr. cyrus vance as special assistant to the secretary of defense and other would proceed to detroit for conference with the governor and other appropriate official
 this plan proceed precisely as schedule approximately 5,000 federal troop be on their way by airlift to detroit michigan within a few hour mr. vance general throckmorton and other be in detroit and in conference with governor romney by the middle of this afternoon
 their initial report be that it then appear that the situation might be control without bring the federal troop from the selfridge air force base into downtown detroit they therefore recommend to the president that the troop be maintain on a 30 minute alert and they advise that they would be in continual touch with the situation and with secretary mcnamara and i make periodic report about every 30 minute
 at approximately 10:30 this evening mr. vance and general throckmorton report to i by telephone that it be the then unanimous opinion of all the state and federal official who be in consultation include governor romney mr. vance general throckmorton the mayor and other that the situation have develop in such a way in the few intervene hour as to make the use of federal troop to augment the police and michigan national guard imperative they describe the situation in considerable detail include the violence and death that have occur in the past few hour and submit as the unanimous judgment of all concerned that the situation be totally beyond the control of the local authority
 on the basis of this confirmation of the need for participation by federal troop and pursuant to the official request make by the governor of the state of michigan in which mayor cavanagh of detroit join i forthwith issue the necessary proclamation and executive order as provide by the constitution and the statute
 i advise mr. vance and general throckmorton to proceed immediately with the transportation of the federal troop from selfridge air force base to place of deployment within detroit a movement which they have already provisionally begin pursuant to their authority
 i be sure the american people will realize that i take this action with the great regret and only because of the clear unmistakable and undisputed evidence that governor romney of michigan and the local official in detroit have be unable to bring the situation under control
 law enforcement be a local matter it be the responsibility of local official and the governors of the respective states the federal government should not intervene except in the most extraordinary circumstance
 the fact of the matter however be that law and order have break down in detroit michigan
 pillage looting murder and arson have nothing to do with civil right they be criminal conduct the federal government in the circumstance here present have no alternative but to respond since it be call upon by the governor of the state and since it be present with proof of his inability to restore order in michigan
 we will not tolerate lawlessness we will not endure violence it matter not by whom it be do or under what slogan or banner it will not be tolerate this nation will do whatever it be necessary to do to suppress and to punish those who engage in it
 i know that with few exception the people of detroit and the people of newark and the people of harlem and of all of our american city however troubled they may be deplore and condemn these criminal act i know that the vast majority of negroes and white be shock and outrage by they
 so tonight your president call upon all of our people in all of our city to join in a determined program to maintain law and order to condemn and to combat lawlessness in all of its form and firmly to show by word and by deed that riot looting and public disorder will just not be tolerate
 in particular i call upon the people of the ravage area to return to their home to leave the street and to permit the authority to restore quiet and order without further loss of life or property damage once this be do attention can immediately be turn to the great and urgent problem of repair the damage that have be do
 i appeal to every american in this grave hour to respond to this plea

my fellow americans
 we have endure a week such as no nation should live through a time of violence and tragedy
 for a few minute tonight i want to talk about that tragedy and i want to talk about the deep question it raise for we all
 i be tonight appoint a special advisory commission on civil disorders
 governor otto kerner of illinois have agree to serve as chairman mayor john lindsay of new york will serve as vice chairman its other member will include fred r. harris senator from oklahoma edward w. brooke united states senator from massachusetts james c. corman u.s. representative from california 22d district los angeles william m. mcculloch the u.s. representative from the state of ohio the 4th district i. w. abel the president of the united steel workers charles b. thornton the president director and chairman of the board of litton industries inc. roy wilkins the executive director of the naacp katherine graham peden the commissioner of commerce of the state of kentucky herbert jenkins the chief of police atlanta georgia
 the commission will investigate the origin of the recent disorder in our city it will make recommendation to i to the congress to the state governors and to the mayor for measure to prevent or contain such disaster in the future
 in their work the commission member will have access to the fact that be gather by director edgar hoover and the federal bureau of investigation the fbi will continue to exercise its full authority to investigate these riot in accordance with my standing instruction and continue to search for evidence of conspiracy
 but even before the commission begin its work and even before all the evidence be in there be some thing that we can tell about the outbreak of this summer
 first let there be no mistake about it the looting arson plunder and pillage which have occur be not part of the civil right protest there be no american right to loot store or to burn building or to fire rifle from the rooftop that be crime and crime must be deal with forcefully and swiftly and certainly under law
 innocent people negro and white have be kill damage to property own by negro and white be calamitous bad of all fear and bitterness which have be loose will take long month to erase
 the criminal who commit these act of violence against the people deserve to be punish and they must be punish explanation may be offer but nothing can excuse what they have do
 there will be attempt to interpret the event of the past few day but when violence strike then those in public responsibility have an immediate and a very different job not to analyze but to end disorder
 that they must seek to do with every mean at their command through local police state official and in extraordinary circumstance where local authority have state that they can not maintain order with their own resource then through federal power that we have limited authority to use
 i have direct the secretary of defense to issue new training standard for riot control procedure immediately to national guard unit across the country through the continental army command this expand training will begin immediately the national guard must have the ability to respond effectively quickly and appropriately in condition of disorder and violence
 those charge with the responsibility of law enforcement should and must be respect by all of our people the violence must be stop quickly finally and permanently
 it would compound the tragedy however if we should settle for order that be impose by the muzzle of a gun
 in america we seek more than the uneasy calm of martial law we seek peace that be base on one man 's respect for another man and upon mutual respect for law we seek a public order that be build on steady progress in meet the need of all of our people
 not even the stern police action nor the most effective federal troop can ever create last peace in our city
 the only genuine long range solution for what have happen lie in an attack mount at every level upon the condition that breed despair and violence all of we know what those condition be ignorance discrimination slum poverty disease not enough job we should attack these condition not because we be frighten by conflict but because we be fire by conscience we should attack they because there be simply no other way to achieve a decent and orderly society in america
 in the past 3 1/2 year we have direct the great governmental effort in all of our american history at these ancient enemy the roll call of those law reveal the depth of our concern the model cities act the voters rights act the civil rights act the rent supplement act medicare and medicaid the 24 educational bill head start the job corps the neighborhood youth corps the teacher corps manpower development and training and many many more act too numerous to mention on television tonight
 we will continue to press for law which would protect our citizen from violence like the safe streets and crime control act now under consideration in the congress and the gun control act
 our work have just begin yet there be those who feel that even this beginning be too much there be those who would have we turn back even now at the beginning of this journey
 last week in congress a small but important plan for action in the city be vote down in the house of representatives the member of that body reject my request for $ 20 million to fight the pestilence of rat rat which prowl in dark alley and tenement and attack thousand of city child the passage of this legislation would have mean much to the child of the slum a strong government that have spend million to protect baby calf from worm could surely afford to show as much concern for baby boy and girl
 there be some tonight who feel that we can not afford a model city program they reduce my request for fund this year by two third
 there be some who feel that we can not afford additional good teacher for the child of poverty in urban area or new effort to house those who be most in need of housing or to aid in education to those who need to read and write
 theirs be a strange system of bookkeepe
 i believe we should be count the asset that these measure can bring to america city rich in opportunity city more full of promise city of order progress and happiness instead some be count the seed of bitterness
 this be not a time for angry reaction it be a time for action start with legislative action to improve the life in our city the strength and promise of the law be the sure remedy for tragedy in the street
 but law be only one answer another answer lie in the way our people will respond to these disturbance
 there be a danger that the bad toll of this tragedy will be count in the heart of americans in hatred in insecurity in fear in heated word which will not end the conflict but prolong it
 so let we acknowledge the tragedy but let we not exaggerate it
 let we look about tonight let we look at ourselves we will see these thing
 most americans negro and white be lead decent responsible and productive life
 most americans negro and white seek safety in their neighborhood and harmony with their neighbor
 nothing can destroy good will more than a period of needless strife and suspicion between the race
 let we condemn the violent few but let we remember that it be law abide negro family who have really suffer most at the hand of the rioter it be responsible negro citizen who hope most fervently and need most urgently to share in america 's growth and prosperity
 this be no time to turn away from that goal
 to reach it will require more than law and much more than dollar it will take renew dedication and understanding in the heart of every citizen
 i know there be million of man and woman tonight who be eager to heal the wound that we have suffer who want to get on with the job of teaching and working and build america
 in that spirit at the conclusion of this address i will sign a proclamation tonight call for a day of prayer in our nation throughout all of our states on this sunday july 30 i urge the citizen in every town every city and every home in this land to go into their church to pray for order and reconciliation among man
 i appeal to every governor every mayor every preacher and every teacher and parent to join and give leadership in this national observance
 this spirit of dedication can not be limit to our public leader it must extend to every citizen in this land and the man who speak to break the peace must feel the powerful disapproval of all of his neighbor
 so tonight i call upon every american to search his own heart
 and to those who be tempt by violence i would say this think again who be really the loser when violence come whose neighborhood be make a shamble whose life be threaten most
 if you choose to tear down what other hand have build
 you will not succeed
 you will suffer most from your own crime
 you will learn that there be no victor in the aftermath of violence
 the apostle of violence with their ugly drumbeat of hatred must know that they be now head for ruin and disaster and every man who really want progress or justice or equality must stand against they and their miserable virus of hate
 for other americans especially those in position of public trust i have this message
 your be the duty to bring about a peaceful change in america if your response to these tragic event be only business as usual"—you invite not only disaster but dishonor
 so my fellow citizen let we go about our work let we clear the street of rubble and quench the fire that hatred set let we feed and care for those who have suffer at the rioter hand but let there be no bonus or reward or salute for those who have inflict that suffering
 let we resolve that this violence be go to stop and there will be no bonus to flow from it we can stop it we must stop it we will stop it
 and let we build something much more lasting faith between man and man faith between race and race faith in each other and faith in the promise of beautiful america
 let we pray for the day when mercy and truth be meet together righteousness and peace have kiss each other let we pray and let we work for well job and well housing and well education that so many million of our own fellow americans need so much tonight
 let we then act in the congress in the city hall and in every community so that this great land of our may truly be one nation under god with liberty and justice for all good night and thank you

the president good afternoon lady and gentleman question

 q. mr. president would you give we please your current assessment of the situation in vietnam and the meaning and significance of what seem to be a rather obvious lull in the ground war and an equally obvious stepping up of bombing more specifically do you agree with your army chief of staff general harold k. johnson that 45,000 more troop may be enough to see we through to a solution

 the president the people of vietnam be in the middle of an election campaign to select a president and a vice president and about 60 member of their senate in october they will elect a house of representatives

 from time to time there seem to be from news report and operation report acceleration escalation lull and other various type of description of our activity out there

 our policy in vietnam be the same we be there to deter aggression

 we be there to permit the people of south vietnam to determine for themselves who their leader should be and what kind of government they should have

 it be remarkable that a young country fight a tough war on its own soil have move so far so fast toward a representative government

 since we first go to honolulu we have urge that step be take in this direction first the constituent assembly be elect next a constitution be write

 at guam that constitution be give to we a pledge be make that they would have free and fair election that the people would have a chance to select a president and a vice president and member of the senate

 in the last 2 or 3 day there have be a lull in the air activity that be because of the weather and because those who direct our operation there feel it be necessary to restrain themselves and not to carry out certain target that be available to they

 our activity in the south be determine a great deal by what the enemy there be willing to do more and more here of late we think that because of the loss he have suffer because of the position in which he find himself he be less anxious to engage our troop in combat

 as a consequence last week we have one of the low kill in action rate that we have have in several week

 that be not to indicate that we will not have a bad week next week

 but weather enemy operation local condition all of those determine in some respect what happen between a lull and step up activity

 so far as this government be concern our policy have not change it remain the same we be steadfast in our determination to make our pledge good to keep our commitment and to resist the attempt to take over this little country by brute force

 q. mr. president in this same context what do you think account for fear be express on capitol hill even to the point of a suggestion today that the election possibly be postpone what do you think account for fear up there that maybe the election will not be on the up and up

 the president well i think that that be to be expect in all election

 i have participate in a good many i have never know one where there be not some who question the efficiency of the election the accuracy of the election or the wisdom of the voter expression

 the date for the election have be set the nearer you get to that election date the more charge you will hear concern the individual candidate concern the method they use concern the type of candidate you should select and concern anything they can question or criticize

 we do that in this country you will expect more of it in a young country that be really have its first overall national election under wartime condition

 we hope that whoever win civilian or military leader will work together and will cooperate in the essential work that be ahead of they

 we realize that one of our most difficult period be go to be between now and the early part of september we have realize that all along we have have to adjust a good many thing in this country as long as we have have a constitution

 during the election period we have to forgo a good many thing we have to indulge ourselves the luxury of a great many rash statement and criticism you can expect that to come from south vietnam we be go to do all we can

 it be not our election it be not our government we be not run thing

 it seem to i this be a matter for the vietnamese themselves

 but to the extent that our counsel be seek and our advice be follow we be go to do everything we can to see that we have an orderly free and fair election

 ambassador bunker who be one of our most experienced man tell i that he be hopeful that this will come about

 q. mr. president a number of people be ask more for the city in the way of social welfare but how about the thing that you have already recommend for example sir yesterday the house pass a social security bill close to your recommendation but the rest of your domestic program seem to be founder up on the hill how do you see this

 the president we have almost 100 measure pende in the congress about half of they have be pass at the end of the congress in the last few month of any congress we try to make a maximum effort to clean up all the bill that be leave

 we be very happy at the action that the ways and means committee in the house of representatives take on our social security measure there be some matter that they bring into it that we have hope they would not there be some reduction make that we do not favor

 but generally speak our recommendation be carefully consider the house act in its judgment and pass by that overwhelming vote yesterday a measure that i think the senate can improve i hope it will be send to the president

 we do have a crime control measure that have be act upon by the house we have a civil right measure that have be act upon by the house we have an economic opportunity act it be now pende in the house committee

 we have a model city bill that have be greatly reduce in the house but i expect the senate to act on it this week we have a rent supplement that the house cut out entirely that should be restore in the senate we hope that it will

 we have the urban renewal measure almost a billion dollar some $ 750 million we have the urban mass transit the urban research we have the rat extermination the education bill some 15 or 20 measure that be extremely important to the city

 i have talk to all the leadership about it i have talk to a good many of the individual member about they

 i think there be a general belief that the congress will consider all of these measure and i believe pass most of they we do not expect to get everything that we have recommend but we believe we will get most of it we think it be essential

 as i say in my letter to senator mansfield we have housing legislation we have rent supplement we have model city and we have a good poverty bill i believe congress will in the last few day of this session face up to all of these measure and pass they

 q. mr. president this week a family that lose a young son in vietnam send a letter reject your note of sympathy call the war senseless

 i would be interested to know how this affect you do it upset you how do you respond to that kind of mail

 the president i hear that over the radio i regret of course the feeling of the family but i can understand the feeling of any parent who have lose a child

 when i hear it i just wish that it be possible for i to have enough time to sit down and express the gratitude this nation feel for the service of the young man such as the one who belong to this home and perhaps give they a little well explanation of what we be do there and why

 q. mr. president the south vietnamese chief of state general thieu have say that if he be elect president in the election next month he will ask for a bombing pause and another attempt to get peace talk start

 could you tell we how you feel about a bombing pause after the election

 the president i would be glad to consider and discuss any proposal that would indicate it would lead to productive discussion that might bring about peace in that area of the world

 i be very happy that chief of state thieu and prime minister ky indicate that after the election they be hopeful condition would be such that productive discussion and negotiation could take place

 the united states be very anxious to meet with the representative of the north vietnamese government at any time at a mutually agree place to try to agree on some plan that will resolve these difference

 we have make a number of proposal ourselves as of this moment there have not be communicate to we any change of position any different from that reflect in ho chi minh 's letter of several week ago

 we would of course welcome any indication on the part of the north vietnamese that they would agree to a cease fire that they would agree to negotiation that they would agree that if we have a bombing pause that they would not take advantage of that pause to increase our man kill in action

 q. mr. president on the basis of that lack of indication from hanoi in your opinion base on your information have we reach a stalemate in the vietnam war

 the president no i think there be those who be take a pretty tough drubbing out there who would like for our folk to believe there be a stalemate but i have not be there i can not personally say that i have observe all the action that have take place

 general westmoreland be there i have send general wheeler there within the month

 general johnson the chief of staff of our army have just return from there

 general larsen a very able general who have be in the ii corps now for 2 year have just return from there

 all of these man think that the stalemate charge be nothing more than propaganda

 q. it will come as no surprise to you sir that there be a number of critic of your vietnam policy inside and outside the press but the minneapolis tribune for example have in the past rather consistently support your objective and policy in vietnam

 but on tuesday of this week its lead editorial call your permission to bomb within 10 mile of china a dangerous escalation of the bombing which could lead to war with china

 what would your counsel be to this imply anxiety

 the president first i would like to make it clear that these air strike be not intend as any threat to communist china they do not in fact pose any threat to that country we believe that peking know that the united states do not seek to widen the war in vietnam

 the evidence have be quite clear we think that the strike be make against the major military staging area and line of communication where the enemy have be concentrate his supply and troop the transportation route and bridge over which those troop have be move against our man have be hit

 we think that these target be directly relate to the enemy 's capacity to move material into south vietnam to kill american boy

 the target to we be clearly identifiable they be carefully select they be all within north vietnam

 the strike be make by the most highly train pilot that we have they employ every human and every technical precaution to insure that the ordnance fall on target it do

 while everyone be entitle to his opinion a good many of they express it the tough the go get the more difficult it will be for some to stay with we and go all the way and last it out

 nevertheless we believe that if we be go to be there it be essential to do everything we can to protect the man we have there

 we be go to try to provide the maximum deterrent at the minimum loss

 q. mr. president representative john conyers say he will introduce legislation to allocate $ 30 billion to rebuild the nation 's ghetto would you support such a project

 the president i think that we have pende before the congress some 15 or 20 measure to try to bring about an improvement of living condition in our city they involve many hundred of million of dollar the congress up to now have not see fit to pass the one we have request

 we be go to urge upon they the program that we have recommend we would be glad to consider any other recommendation that may come but i think we will be rather fortunate if we can pass the measure that be now pende before the congress without material reduction in our recommendation

 for instance the model city program be design to improve the ghetto in the city of the land we ask the congress for $ 2 billion 300 million they reduce that to about $ 1 billion almost half

 then we ask for the funding of $ 600 million of that billion for model city this year they have cut that $ 600 million to $ 200 million

 over the long run many year ahead-- i be confident that we will make substantial increase in our expenditure in the dry if we can get the modal city pass this year if we can get the kaiser commission 's recommendation on the pilot project for housing pass if we can get good sound poverty measure if we can get our rent supplement the program that have already be think out and work out i would be very pleased

 in the meantime we have a group in the housing and urban development organization under secretary weaver and secretary wood as well as mr. kaiser 's committee that have take a look at every proposal that have be make with a view to determine what merit they hold and how far we can go in embrace they

 q. out in des moines this week several thousand farmer authorize the leader of their organization to try to increase farm price by withholding product from the market could you give we your view on the appropriateness and the efficacy of this kind of effort by farmer to increase their price

 the president i think that one of the very serious problem we have in this country all of the consumer be try to insure that the farmer who produce the food we eat and the fiber we wear get a fair price for their product i do not think they have get a fair price over the year in line with the earning of the worker in industry

 i talk with some of the farm leader before the des moines meeting the secretary of agriculture bring in some of those leader

 i think that this government should give very serious consideration to evolve some kind of a program that will give the farmer an equity of fairness on the same basis for bargaining for the price of his product as we have for the worker bargaining for the wage they receive for their labor now the particular of that have not be work out i just do not know how we can obtain it

 but i do think that the farmer be on the short end of the stick i do think that people be leave the farm by the thousand and go into the dry i do think that be create a very serious problem for we

 today the farmer get a small percentage of the dollar for the food that he produce for we than in any other period i would very much hope that the administration at some date in the reasonably near future could find some legislation that would give to the farmer a means of bargaining reasonably and collectively as we permit our worker to do

 q. mr. president the constitution do not give you the right to carry on this war without permission from congress i be sure that you realize that more than anybody in view of this misunderstanding that have occur about the gulf of tonkin resolution why do not you dear up this matter with your critic by call for a new vote in congress on this matter

 the president sarah you do not always clear up your critic that easily they will be with you before the vote and they will be with you after the vote that be the way it be in a democratic society

 i have give a lot of concern and attention to attempt to get the agreement of the congress on the course that the government follow in its commitment abroad

 as a young senator i recall very vividly hear senator taft speak on several occasion about president truman 's intervention in korea he frequently say in substance that while he think what the president do be right he do it the wrong way that he should have consult the congress and he should have ask for their opinion

 now under the constitution the congress have the right to declare to declare war it be never intend that the congress would fight the war direct the war take the bomber off the ground put they back on it or ground they but it have the responsibility to declare the war

 senator taft think that president truman before he commit our troop in korea should have ask the congress not necessarily for a declaration but for an opinion for a resolution

 president eisenhower follow that policy in several instance ask the congress for an opinion he discuss it with the leader before he submit the resolution

 back in may and june 1964 before the tonkin gulf we consider what we should do in order to keep the congress inform to keep they in place and to keep they in agreement with what our action should be there in case of contingency there be very active debate in the government as i remember it back as far as may and june of that year then we have the tonkin gulf

 after the tonkin gulf we respond to the action with appropriate measure in the tonkin gulf

 but after that we feel that we should point out that there be likelihood there would be other instance we could see the problem develop in that area so we ask the leadership of the congress to come to the white house

 we review with they senator taft 's statement about korea and the action that president eisenhower have take and ask their judgment about the resolution that would give we the opinion of the congress

 we be inform that a resolution be think desirable so the member of the executive and legislative branch talk about the content of that resolution

 a resolution be draft that be review with the leader on i believe august 4 1964

 i send a message up to the congress shortly afterwards and ask for consideration of a resolution some of the members of the congress feel that they should amend the resolution even after amendment have already be put into it by member to provide that if at any time the congress feel that the authority delegate in the resolution should be withdraw the congress without wait for a recommendation from the president he might differ with they could withdraw that authority by just pass a resolution which do not require the president 's veto they could do it by themselves

 that suggestion be make to i by a prominent senator i readily accept

 so the machinery be there any time the congress desire to withdraw its view on the matter

 we state then and we repeat now we do not think the resolution be necessary to do what we do and what we be do but we think it be desirable we think if we be go to ask they to stay the whole route and if we expect they to be there on the landing we ought to ask they to be there on the takeoff

 so secretary rusk and secretary mcnamara go before the house foreign affairs committee and the armed services committee then they go before the senate foreign relations committee and the senate armed services committee they testify before all four of those committee

 as i say they accept some suggestion by the congressmen and senators and amend the resolution the committee report the resolution i believe the foreign affairs committee of the house report unanimously the armed services committee go along with it

 on the foreign relations committee of the senate i think there be only one vote against it senator morse then it go out to both chambers for debate

 we have state our view in the message and in the measure the leadership too express our view in some of their statement

 on august 5th 6th and 7th during that period there be debate 2 day in the senate i believe on the 6th and 7th i do not recall the date exactly in the house but that resolution be send to we by a vote of over 500 to 2

 i believe that every congressman and most of the senators know what that resolution say that resolution authorize the president and express the congress willingness to go along with the president to do whatever be necessary to deter aggression

 now we be as i say try to provide a maximum deterrent with a minimum loss we think we be well within the ground of our constitutional responsibility we think we be well within the right of what the congress say in its resolution

 the remedy be there if we have act unwisely or improperly

 it be go to be tough as it get along the long the fighting last the more sacrifice be require in man and materiel the more dissent the more difficult it be go to be

 but i do not believe we be act beyond our constitutional responsibility

 q. mr. president what be your idea on the need for early processing of the billion of gallon of oil from oil shale in colorado in the rocky mountains in view of the middle east stoppage of oil shipment

 the president the secretary of the interior since the middle east crisis have have a very special group in his department deal with import and production matter his various advisory committee give he counsel as to emergency measure that could be take and some that have be take to adequately protect our petroleum requirement

 they be reasonably well in hand we think that there be a great future in the oil shale development i would doubt that in this immediate crisis that you could expect any great acceleration

 but if at any time our petroleum supply should be threaten more than it be now the need should become great in any event just as the process develop you can expect further action in that field but i do not think it be imminent now

 q. sir early this week budget director schultze say the administration hope to squeeze out between $ 1 1/2 billion and $ 2 billion from the administrative budget could you share with we your thinking as to where some of these cut might come

 the president yes from the 15 appropriation bill send to the congress two of which have be pass we be examine they now there be little indication that much in the way of saving can come from they

 we have talk to the chairman of the appropriations committee of the house where they originate last week mr. mahon be here early in the morning we have point out the problem we have we have urge the leadership to set a target date for get those appropriation bill to we so they can be examine

 there be about $ 61 billion worth of nondefense expenditure in the budget we would expect to have to get the congress to reduce many hundred of million perhaps several billion in those appropriation if the congress fail to do it we will have to see where it fail what bill contain the money we think can be reduce and that have the low priority and then act

 each department have be instruct to immediately contact the chairman of its subcommittee and urge they to take action on the bill when those reduction be make by the congress if they be not sufficient then the executive be pledge to make further reduction

 we believe we should try to keep our borrowing within 50 percent of the anticipated deficit we hope that we can get a tax bill that will raise about $ 7 billion plus that will amount to about 25 percent of the anticipated deficit

 then we believe by refuse to pass certain measure that have be propose and be pende by take action on other measure that the house have reduce by reduce several billion ourselve the congress and the executive can reduce the anticipated deficit by some 20 or 25 percent in withholding deferment impounding and actual cut

 thank you mr. president





speaker barnes governor hughes governor smith congressman kazen representative graham most distinguished legislator lady and gentleman
 i deeply appreciate this opportunity to appear before an organization whose member contribute every day such important work to the public affair of our state and of our country
 this evening i come here to speak to you about vietnam
 i do not have to tell you that our people be profoundly concerned about that struggle
 there be passionate conviction about the wise course for our nation to follow there be many sincere and patriotic americans who harbor doubt about sustain the commitment that three president and a half a million of our young man have make
 doubt and debate be enlarge because the problem of vietnam be quite complex they be a mixture of political turmoil of poverty of religious and factional strife of ancient servitude and modern longing for freedom vietnam be all of these thing
 vietnam be also the scene of a powerful aggression that be spur by an appetite for conquest
 it be the arena where communist expansionism be most aggressively at work in the world today where it be cross international frontier in violation of international agreement where it be kill and kidnaping where it be ruthlessly attempt to bend free people to its will
 into this mixture of subversion and war of terror and hope america have enter with its material power and with its moral commitment why
 why should three president and the elect representative of our people have choose to defend this asian nation more than 10,000 mile from american shore
 we cherish freedom yes we cherish self determination for all people yes we abhor the political murder of any state by another and the bodily murder of any people by gangster of whatever ideology and for 27 year since the day of lend lease we have seek to strengthen free people against domination by aggressive foreign power
 but the key to all that we have do be really our own security at time of crisis before ask americans to fight and die to resist aggression in a foreign land every american president have finally have to answer this question
 be the aggression a threat not only to the immediate victim but to the united states of america and to the peace and security of the entire world of which we in america be a very vital part
 that be the question which dwight eisenhower and john kennedy and lyndon johnson have to answer in face the issue in vietnam
 that be the question that the senate of the united states answer by a vote of 82 to 1 when it ratify and approve the seato treaty in 1955 and to which the members of the united states congress respond in a resolution that it pass in 1964 by a vote of 504 to 2 the united states be therefore prepare as the president determine to take all necessary step include the use of armed force to assist any member or protocol state of the southeast asia collective defense treaty request assistance in defense of its freedom
 those who tell we now that we should abandon our commitment that secure south vietnam from armed domination be not worth the price we be pay must also answer this question and the test they must meet be this what would be the consequence of let armed aggression against south vietnam succeed what would follow in the time ahead what kind of world be they prepared to live in 5 month or 5 year from tonight
 for those who have bear the responsibility for decision during these past m year the stake to we have seem clear and have seem high
 president dwight eisenhower say in 1959
 strategically south vietnam 's capture by the communists would bring their power several hundred mile into a hitherto free region the remain country in southeast asia would be menace by a great flanking movement the freedom of 12 million people would be lose immediately and that of 150 million in adjacent land would be seriously endanger the loss of south vietnam would set in motion a crumble process that could as it progress have grave consequence for we and for freedom
 and president john f. kennedy say in 1962
 withdrawal in the case of vietnam and the case of thailand might mean a cob lapse of the entire area
 a year later he reaffirm that
 we be not go to withdraw from that effort in my opinion for we to withdraw from that effort would mean a collapse not only of south vietnam but southeast asia so we be go to stay there say president kennedy
 this be not simply an american viewpoint i would have you legislative leader know i be go to call the roll now of those who live in that part of the world in the great arc of asian and pacific nation and who bear the responsibility for lead their people and the responsibility for the fate of their people
 the president of the philippines have this to say
 vietnam be the focus of attention now it may happen to thailand or the philippines or anywhere wherever there be misery disease ignorance for you to renounce your position of leadership in asia be to allow the red chinese to gobble up all of asia
 the foreign minister of thailand say
 the american decision will go down in history as the move that prevent the world from have to face another major conflagration
 the prime minister of australia say
 we be there because while communist aggression persist the whole of southeast asia be threaten
 president park of korea say
 for the first time in our history we decide to dispatch our combat troop overseas because in our belief any aggression against the republic of vietnam represent a direct and grave menace against the security and peace of free asia and therefore directly jeopardize the very security and freedom of our own people
 the prime minister of malaysia warn his people that if the united states pull out of south vietnam it would go to the communists and after that it would be only a matter of time until they move against neighboring state
 the prime minister of new zealand say we can thank god that america at least regard aggression in asia with the same concern as it regard aggression in europe and be prepared to back up its concern with action
 the prime minister of singapore say
 i feel the fate of asia south and southeast asia will be decide in the next few year by what happen in vietnam
 i can not tell you tonight as your president with certainty that a communist conquest of south vietnam would be follow by a communist conquest of southeast asia but i do know there be north vietnamese troop in laos i do know that there be north vietnamese train guerrilla tonight in northeast thailand i do know that there be communist support guerrilla force operate in burma and a communist coup be barely avert in indonesia the fifth large nation in the world
 so your american president can not tell you with certainty that a southeast asia dominate by communist .power would bring a third world war much close to terrible reality one could hope that this would not be so
 but all that we have learn in this tragic century strongly suggest to i that it would be so as president of the united states i be not prepared to gamble on the chance that it be not so i be not prepared to risk the security indeed the survival of this american nation on mere hope and wishful thinking i be convinced that by see this struggle through now we be greatly reduce the chance of a much large war perhaps a nuclear war i would rather stand in vietnam in our time and by meet this danger now and face up to it thereby reduce the danger for our child and for our grandchild
 i want to turn now to the struggle in vietnam itself
 there be question about this difficult war that must trouble every really thoughtful person i be go to put some of these question and i be go to give you the very good answer that i can give you
 first be the vietnamese with our help and that of their other ally really make any progress be there a forward movement the report i see make it clear that there be certainly there be a positive movement toward constitutional government thus far the vietnamese have meet the political schedule that they lay down in january 1966
 the people want an elect responsive government they want it strongly enough to brave a vicious campaign of communist terror and assassination to vote for it it have be say that they kill more civilian in 4 week try to keep they from vote before the election than our american bomber have kill in the big city of north vietnam in bomb military target
 on november 1 subject to the action of course of the constituent assembly an elect government will be inaugurate and an elect senate and legislature will be instal their responsibility be clear to answer the desire of the south vietnamese people for self determination and for peace for an attack on corruption for economic development and for social justice
 there be progress in the war itself steady progress consider the war that we be fight rather dramatic progress consider the situation that actually prevail when we send our troop there in 1965 when we intervene to prevent the dismemberment of the country by the vietcong and the north vietnamese
 the campaign of the last year drive the enemy from many of their major interior basis the military victory almost within hanoi 's grasp in 1965 have now be deny they the grip of the vietcong on the people be be break
 since our commitment of major force in july 1965 the proportion of the population live under communist control have be reduce to well under 20 percent tonight the secure proportion of the population have grow from about 45 percent to 65 percent and in the contest area the tide continue to run with we
 but the struggle remain hard the south vietnamese have suffer severely as have we particularly in the first corps area in the north where the enemy have mount his heavy attack and where his line of communication to north vietnam be shortest our casualty in the war have reach about 13,500 kill in action and about 85,000 wound of those 85,000 wound we thank god that 79,000 of the 85,000 have be return or will return to duty shortly thank to our great american medical science and the helicopter
 i know there be other question on your mind and on the mind of many sincere troubled americans why not negotiate now so many ask i the answer be that we and our south vietnamese ally be wholly prepared to negotiate tonight
 i be ready to talk with ho chi minh and other chief of state concern tomorrow
 i be ready to have secretary rusk meet with their foreign minister tomorrow
 i be ready to send a trust representative of america to any spot on this earth to talk in public or private with a spokesman of hanoi
 we have twice seek to have the issue of vietnam deal with by the united nations and twice hanoi have refuse
 our desire to negotiate peace through the united nations or out have be make very very clear to hanoi directly and many time through third party
 as we have tell hanoi time and time and time again the heart of the matter be really this the united states be willing to stop all aerial and naval bombardment of north vietnam when this will lead promptly to productive discussion we of course assume that while discussion proceed north vietnam would not take advantage of the bombing cessation or limitation
 but hanoi have not accept any of these proposal
 so it be by hanoi 's choice and not ours and not the rest of the world's that the war continue
 why in the face of military and political progress in the south and the burden of our bombing in the north do they insist and persist with the war
 from many source the answer be the same they still hope that the people of the united states will not see this struggle through to the very end as one western diplomat report to i only this week he have just be in hanoi—"they believe their staying power be great than our and that they can not lose a visitor from a communist capital have this to say they expect the war to be long and that the americans in the end will be defeat by a breakdown in morale fatigue and psychological factor the premier of north vietnam say as far back as 1962 americans do not like long inconclusive war thus we be sure to win in the end
 be the north vietnamese right about we
 i think not no i think they be wrong i think it be the common failing of totalitarian regime that they can not really understand the nature of our democracy
 they mistake dissent for disloyalty
 they mistake restlessness for a rejection of policy
 they mistake a few committee for a country
 they misjudge individual speech for public policy
 they be no well suit to judge the strength and perseverance of america than the nazi and the stalinist propagandist be able to judge it it be a tragedy that they must discover these quality in the american people and discover they through a bloody war
 and soon or late they will discover they in the meantime it shall be our policy to continue to seek negotiation confident that reason will some day prevail that hanoi will realize that it just can never win that it will turn away from fighting and start build for its own people
 since world war ii this nation have meet and have master many challenge challenge in greece and turkey in berlin in korea in cuba
 we meet they because brave man be willing to risk their life for their nation 's security and braver man have never live than those who carry our color in vietnam at this very hour
 the price of these effort of course have be heavy but the price of not having make they at all not having see they through in my judgment would have be vastly great
 our goal have be the same in europe in asia in our own hemisphere it have be and it be now peace
 and peace can not be secure by wish peace can not be preserve by noble word and pure intention endure peace franklin d. roosevelt say can not be buy at the cost of other people 's freedom
 the late president kennedy put it precisely in november 1961 when he say we be neither warmonger nor appeaser neither hard nor soft we be americans determined to defend the frontier of freedom by an honorable peace if peace be possible but by arm if arm be use against we
 the true peace keeper in the world tonight be not those who urge we to retire from the field in vietnam who tell we to try to find the quick cheap exit from that torment land no matter what the consequence to we may be
 the true peace keeper be those man who stand out there on the dmz at this very hour take the bad that the enemy can give the true peace keeper be the soldier who be break the terrorist 's grip around the village of vietnam the civilian who be bring medical care and food and education to people who have already suffer a generation of war
 and so i report to you that we be go to continue to press forward two thing we must do two thing we shall do
 first we must not mislead the enemy let he not think that debate and dissent will produce wavering and withdrawal for i can assure you they will not let he not think that protest will produce surrender because they will not let he not think that he will wait we out for he will not
 second we will provide all that our brave man require to do the job that must be do and that job be go to be do
 these gallant man have our prayer have our thank have our heart feel praise and our deep gratitude
 let the world know that the keeper of peace will endure through every trial and that with the full backing of their countryman they be go to prevail

the president good morning lady and gentleman i will be glad to take your question

 q. do you think that at this point our force level in vietnam will begin to level off in authorized strength or do you think more troop may be need in the future

 the president we have previously consider and approve the recommendation of the joint chiefs of staff for the force level

 general westmoreland discuss this at some length with i last night and this morning he anticipate no increase in that level

 q. mr. president we be get close to the end of your 4th year in office you have be subject to a great deal of personal criticism range from a senator in your own party planning to run--

 the president i be generally familiar with that

 q. --to the preacher in williamsburg i wonder how you appraise this personally

 the president it be not a surprise i be aware that this have happen to the 35 president who precede i no public official certainly not one who have be in public life 35 year as i have be would fail to expect criticism

 there be a different type of criticism there be a difference between constructive dissent and storm trooper bullying howling and take the law into your own hand

 i think that the president must expect that those in the other party will frequently find it necessary to find fault and to complain to attempt to picture to the people that the president should be replace

 it be also true in all party that there be division we do not all think alike if we do one man would be do all the thinking

 so you have division in party we have perhaps more than our share sometimes but i be sure the republicans think that too

 when you get into a political year with the help and advice and the abetting that the press can do and the assistance that the oppose party can do because it be to their interest to try to destroy you in order to have a place for themselves and you take the division in your own party and they concentrate then it do seem to mount up and at time occupy a great deal of public attention

 but i do not think it be unusual for a president to be criticize that seem to be one of the thing that go with the job

 not many of we want to say i fail or i make a mistake or we should not have do that or this should not have happen

 it be always easy to say that someone over there be wrong the president be more or less a lightning rod at least i have see that in this country

 i remember to take one or two illustration when president truman very courageously and i think very wisely go into korea

 one of our pollster dash out with a poll dr. gallup and find that that position be approve by about 81 percent six month later when the sacrifice be evident and the problem begin to appear the same pollster talk to the same people find that this have drop from 81 to 26 percent

 now those thing have happen in all of our crisis economic domestic and international a president learn to expect they and learn to live with they

 the important thing for every man who occupy this place be to search as well he can to get the right answer to try to find out what be right and then do it without regard to poll and without regard to criticism

 q. mr. president a good many americans have say that a stop to the bombing be worth try just to see if north vietnam will respond what be your view on this

 the president north vietnam have respond their statement this week in the hanoi newspaper in response to my statement from the enterprise be very clear and very compelling it should answer any person in this country who have ever feel that stop the bombing alone would bring we to the negotiate table

 hanoi make it very clear in response to my appeal from the enterprise that their position in effect be the same as it have always be it be the same as enunciate in ho chi minh 's letter to i which ho chi minh make public

 there be some hopeful people and there be some naive people in this country and there be some political people

 but anyone who really want to know what the position of north vietnam be should read what the spokesman of north vietnam say

 that be well summarize in mr. ho chi minh 's letter to the president that he make public that be on the record that he have never change

 so all of these hope dream and idealistic people go around be misleading and confusing and weaken our position

 q. do you have any evidence that the vietcong might be move toward the position of want to negotiate separate from hanoi and if so what would be your attitude toward negotiate with they

 the president i would prefer to handle our negotiation through diplomatic channel with whomsoever we may negotiate

 i do not think this be the place to do our negotiating we be very anxious to find a solution that will bring an end to the war

 as we have state so many time we be ready to meet and discuss that with the official of hanoi and the vietcong will have no problem in have their voice fully hear and consider

 but i think that it would be well if we would wait until opportunity develop along that line and then do it through our train diplomat

 q. mr. president a minute ago you talk about the job of be president this wednesday you be go to complete 4 year in the office of the president i wonder if you could reflect for a moment on the presidency and what have be your great satisfaction and what be your great disappointment

 the president well i think we have well do that a little later i can not tell all the good thing that have happen or the bad one either in these 4 year in a 30 minute press conference i would be charge with filibustering

 but we primarily want to think of the future and not the past

 it have be almost two century since our revolution and since we win our freedom we have come a long way during that period but we have much farth to go as you can see from our education and health and city statistic and farm statistic

 as long as there be four people out of every ten in the world who can not spell cat or can not write dog we have much to do

 i be particularly proud of what we have do in education from head start to adult education where man and woman past 70 be learn to read and write for the first time

 i be very pleased for instance that we have raise our contribution from the federal government to high education from 16 percent to 24 percent in the last 4 year while the states have remain practically static

 we have make revolutionary stride in education in health in conservation where we be probably take in as much land in the public domain for the first time in year as we be let out

 we feel that we have bring a degree of stability into our international relation to this hemisphere through the alliance for progress and our meeting at punta del este

 work with other nation we have make material advance in help underdeveloped nation in africa

 we be very pleased with what have come out of our meeting with the germans and with the british in connection with our trilateral talk what have come out of our kennedy round meeting the several treaty that we have negotiate with the soviet union and the one that we be work on so hard now the nonproliferation treaty

 we be happy that 9 million more people have good pay job today than have they when i come into this office

 but these be thing of the past and we should accept they be here we want to preserve they

 but the important problem be ahead what be the next century go to be like what be the third century go to be like

 as long as the ancient enemy be rampant in the world illiteracy ignorance disease poverty and war there be much for government to do

 we be work on that now we will be talk more to you about that in the month ahead

 q. mr. president in view of your talk this week with general westmoreland ambassador bunker and other what be your present assessment of our progress and prospect in vietnam

 the president well i will repeat to you their assessment because they be the one who be in the good position to judge thing locally i will give you my evaluation of what they have say

 first i think every american 's heart should swell with pride at the competence and capacity of our leadership in vietnam

 i believe and our allied people believe that we have a superior leadership i think it be the good that the united states of america can produce in experience in judgment in training in general competence

 i have have three meeting with ambassador bunker and three with general westmoreland i have coffee with he at length this morning just before i come here

 our american people when we get in a contest of any kind whether it be in a war an election a football game or whatever it be want it decide and decide quickly get in or get out

 they like that curve to rise like this indicate a sharp rise and they like the opposition to go down like this indicate a sharply decline line

 that be not the kind of war we be fight in vietnam

 we make our statement to the world of what we would do if we have communist aggression in that part of the world in 1954

 we say we would stand with those people in the face of common danger

 the time come when we have to put up or shut up we put up and we be there we do not march out and have a big battle each day in a guerrilla war it be a new kind of war for we so it do not move that fast

 summarizing and try to be fully responsive to your question in the time allot we be move more like this indicate gradual rise they be move more like this indicate decline instead of straight up and straight down

 we be make progress we be pleased with the result that we be get

 we be inflict great loss than we be take

 amidst the horror of war and more people have be kill try to vote in south vietnam than have be kill by bomb in north vietnam accord to the north vietnam figure in the midst of all the horror of war in guerrilla fighting in south vietnam we have have five election in a period of a little over 14 month

 there be great doubt whether we could have any it take we from 1776 to 1789 -not 13 month but 13 year to get a constitution with our anglo saxon background and all the training we have

 to think that here in the midst of war when the grenade be pop like firecracker all around you that two third or three fourth of the people would register and vote and have 5 election in 13 month and through the democratic process select people at the local level a constituent assembly a house of representative a senate a president and a vice president that be encouraging

 the fact that the population under free control have constantly rise and that under communist control have constantly go down be a very encouraging sign

 the improvement that have be make by the south vietnamese themselves in put in reform in announce other program and in improve their own army be a matter of great satisfaction to ambassador bunker and to general westmoreland

 we have a lot to do yet a great many mistake have be make we take two step forward and we slip back one it be not all perfect by any mean

 there be a good many day when we get a c minus instead of an a plus

 but overall we be make progress we be satisfied with that progress our ally be pleased with that progress every country that i know in that area that be familiar with what be happen think it be absolutely essential that uncle sam keep his word and stay there until we can find an honorable peace

 if they have any doubt about it mr. ho chi minh who read our paper and who listen to our radio who look at our television if he have any doubt about it i want to disillusion he this morning

 we keep our commitment our people be go to support the man who be there the man there be go to bring we an honorable peace

 q. mr. president hanoi may be interpret current public opinion poll to indicate that you will be replace next year how should this affect the campaign in this country

 the president i do not know how it will affect the campaign in this country whatever interpretation hanoi might make that would lead they to believe that uncle sam whoever may be president be go to pull out and it will be easy for they to make an inside deal with another president then they will make a serious misjudgment

 q. be you go to run next year

 the president i will cross that bridge when i get to it as i have tell you so many time

 q. mr. president there be increase statement from capitol hill that say your tax bill be dead for this session of congress be there any plan on the part of your administration to try and revive this before congress leave and secondly if not what plan might you have next year to avert this inflationary trend that we be tell will be come

 the president we want very much to have a tax bill just as quickly as we can get it we think the sound prudent fiscal policy require it we be go to do everything that the president and the administration can do to get that tax bill

 i would be less than frank if i do not tell you that i have no indication whatever that mr. mills or mr. byrnes or the ways and means committee be likely to report a tax bill before they adjourn

 i feel that one of our failure in the administration have be our inability to convince the congress of the wisdom of fiscal responsibility and the necessity of pass a tax bill not only for the effect it will have on the inflationary development but the effect it will have on the huge deficit that we be run

 i think one of the great mistake that the congress will make be that mr. ford and mr. mills have take this position that they can not have any tax bill now they will live to rue the day when they make that decision because it be a dangerous decision it be an unwise decision

 i think that the people of america none of whom want to pay taxis any pollster can walk out and say do you want to pay more tax of course you will say no i do not want to pay tax

 but if you ask he do you want inflation do you want price to increase 5 or 6 percent do you want a deficit of $ 30 or $ 35 billion do you want to spend $ 35 billion more than you be take in i think the average citizen would say no

 here at the height of our prosperity when our gross national product be go to run at $ 850 billion when we look at the precedent of what we have do in past war in korea when president truman ask for a tax increase people support it

 this request have be before the congress since last january they have finish most of the appropriation bill i read the story this morning it look like out of $ 145 billion they will roughly cut a billion dollar in expenditure

 but they will cut several billion from revenue because of inaction because people do not like to stand up and do the unpopular thing of assume responsibility that man in public life be require to do sometime

 i know it do not add to your poll and your popularity to say we have to have additional taxis to fight this war abroad and fight the problem in our city at home but we can do it with the gross national product we have we should do it and i think when the american people and the congress get the full story they will do it

 we have fail up to now to be able to convince they but we be go to continue to try in every way that be proper

 q. senator mccarthy have say he be consider oppose you in the presidential primary because he believe it would be a healthy thing to debate vietnam in the primary for the party and for the country too do you agree with he what effect do you think this would have on your own candidacy

 the president i do not know how i be go to be after all this opposition develop so far as my state of health be concern but i be very healthy today i do not know whether this criticism have contribute to my good health or not

 i do not know what senator mccarthy be go to do i be not sure that he know what he plan to do i think we have well just wait and see until there be something definite there and meet it when it be necessary

 q. why do you think there be so much confusion frustration and difference of opinion in this country about the war in vietnam

 the president there have always be confusion frustration and difference of opinion when there be a war go on

 there be in the revolutionary war when only about a third of the people think that be a wise move a third of they oppose it and a third be on the sideline

 that be true when all of new england come down to secede in madison 's administration in the war of 1812 and stop in baltimore they do not quite make it because andrew jackson 's result in new orleans come in

 they be have a party there that night the next morning they come and tell the president they want to congratulate he that they have think he be right all along although they have come from boston to baltimore in a secessionist move

 that be true in the mexican war when the congress overwhelmingly vote to go in and later pass a resolution that have grave doubt about it some of the most bitter speech be make they be so bitter they could not be publish they have m hold up publication of they for 100 year

 i do not have to remind you of what happen in the civil war people be here in the white house beg lincoln to concede and work out a deal with the confederacy when word come to he of his victory they tell he that pennsylvania be go that illinois have no chance

 those pressure come to a president

 you know what president roosevelt go through and president wilson in world war i. he have some senators from certain area then that give he very serious problem until victory be assure

 now when you look back upon it there be very few people who would think that wilson roosevelt or truman be in error

 we be go to have this criticism we be go to have these difference

 no one like war all people love peace but you can not have freedom without defend it

 q. mr. president the foreign aid authorization have be cut back nearly a third from what you request what be the impact of this economy

 the president at a time when the rich nation in the world be enjoy more prosperity than it have ever have before when we carefully tailor our request to the very minimum that we think be essential the low request that we have have in year and then congress cut it 33 1/3 percent i think it be a mistake it be a serious mistake

 when you consider that $ 1 billion that we be attempt to save there out of the $ 850 billion that we will produce we ought to reconsider that decision because what we be do with that money not only can give great help to underdeveloped nation but that in itself can prevent the thing that cause war where you be require to spend billion to win it

 i would rather have a little preventive medicine every dollar that we spend in our foreign assistance try to help poor people help themselves be money well spend

 i do not think we overdo it i do not think we go too far but i think the congress have in the reduction it have make

 again it be popular to go back home and say look what i do for you i cut out all these foreign expenditure

 but when the trouble develop the people who be starve the people who be ignorant illiterate and diseased and war spring up and we have to go in we will spend much more than we would if we have take an ounce of prevention

 q. mr. president some people on the air and in print accuse you of try to label all criticism of your vietnam policy as unpatriotic could you tell we whether you have guideline in which you be enable to separate conscientious dissent from irresponsible dissension

 the president no i have not call anyone unpatriotic i have not say anything that would indicate that

 i think the wicked fleeth when no one pursueth sometimes

 i do think that some people be irresponsible make untrue statement and ought to be cautious and careful when they be deal with the problem involve their man at the front

 there be a great deal of difference as i say a moment ago between criticism indifference and responsible dissent all of which we insist on and all of which we protect and storm trooper bullying throw yourself down in the road smash window rowdyism and every time a person attempt to speak to try to drown he out

 we believe very strongly in preserve the right to differ in this country and the right to dissent if i have do a good job of anything since i have be president it be to insure that there be plenty of dissenter

 there be not a person in this press corps that can not write what he want to write most of they do write what they want to i say want advisedly i want to protect that our congress want to protect it

 but if i by chance should say now i be not sure that you see all the cable on this and you be exactly right let i explain the other side of it i would hope that you would not say i be lambaste my critic or that i be assail someone

 what i be try to do be to preserve my right to give the other side i do not think one side ought to dominate the whole picture

 so what i would say be let us realize that we be in the midst of a war let us realize that there be 500,000 of our boy out there who be risk their life to win that war let us ask ourselves what it be we can do to help

 if you think you can make a contribution and help they by express your opinion and dissenting then do it

 but then if the secretary of state start to explain his viewpoint do not send out instruction all over the country and say when he start to talk and say mr. chair man stamp your foot when he come to the end of a sentence all of you do this and at the third sentence all of you boo

 i be amazed that the press in this country who insist on the right to live by the first amendment and to be protect by it do not insist that these storm trooper tactic live by the first amendment too and that they be wipe out

 i think the time have come when it would be good for all of we to take a new fresh look at dissent

 we welcome responsible dissent but there be a great deal of difference between responsible dissent and some of the thing that be take place in this country which i consider to be extremely dangerous to our national interest and i consider not very helpful to the man who be fight the war for we

 now everyone must make that judgment for himself

 i have never say anyone be unpatriotic i do not question these people 's motive i do question their judgment

 i can not say that this dissent have contribute much to any victory we have have

 i can not say that these various proposal that range from a senator to a county commissioner to a mayor of a city have really change general westmoreland 's plan much or ambassador bunker 's approach the paper be fill with it every day

 so i think you have to consider it for what you think it be worth and make your own judgment

 that be the theory of the first amendment

 we do not stop the publication of any paper we do not fine anyone for something they say we just appeal to they to remember that they do not have the privilege at the moment of be out there fight

 please count to 10 before you say something that hurt instead of help

 we know that most people 's intention be good we do not question their motive we have never say they be unpatriotic although they say some pretty ugly thing about we

 people who live in glass house should not be too anxious to throw stone

 q. mr. president be your aim in vietnam to win the war or to seek a compromise negotiate solution

 the president i think our aim in vietnam have be very clear from the beginning they be consistent with the seato treaty with the atlantic charter and with the many many statement that we have make to the congress in connection with the tonkin gulf resolution the secretary of state have make this clear dozen and dozen of time and i make it enough that i think even all the preacher in the country have hear about it

 that be namely to protect the security of the united states we think the security of the united states be definitely tie in with the security of southeast asia

 secondly to resist aggression when we be a party to a treaty that say we will do it then we carry it out

 i think if you see a little child in this room who be try to waddle across the floor and some big bully come along and grab it by the hair and start stomp it i think you would do something about it

 i think that we think we make a mistake when we see hitler move across the landscape of europe the concession that be make by the man carry umbrella at that time i think in retrospect we think that be a mistake

 so as a consequence in 1954 under the leadership of president eisenhower and secretary dulles we have a seato treaty

 it be debate it be consider and it be go into very thoroughly by the senate the man who present that treaty then say this be dangerous the time may come when we may have to put up or shut up

 but we ought to serve notice in asia now as we refuse to serve notice in europe a few year ago that we will resist aggression that we will stand against someone who seek to gobble up little country if those little country call upon we for our help so we do that

 i do not vote for that treaty i be in the hospital senator kennedy do not vote for it the late president he be in the hospital senator dirksen do not vote for it but 82 senators do vote for it they know what be in that treaty

 the time come when we have to decide whether we mean what we say when we say our security be tie in to their security and that we would stand in unison in the face of common danger

 now we be do that we be do it against whoever combine out there to promote aggression we be go to do whatever we think be necessary to protect the security of south vietnam and let those people determine for themselves what kind of a government they have

 we think they be move along very quickly in that direction to develop a democratic procedure

 third we be go to do whatever it be necessary to do to see that the aggressor do not succeed

 those be our purpose those be our goal we be go to get a lot of advice to do this or to do that we be go to consider it all but for year west point have be turn out the good military man produce anywhere in the world

 for year we have have in our foreign service train and specialized people we have in 110 capital today the good brain we can select

 under our constitutional arrangement the president must look to his secretary of state to his foreign policy to his ambassador to the cable and view that they express to his leader like the joint chiefs of staff and to general westmoreland and other and carefully consider everything they say and then do what he think be right

 that be not always go to please a county commissioner or a mayor or a member of a legislature it never have in any war we have ever be in be a favorite of the senate

 the leader on the military committee and the leader in other post have frequently oppose it

 champ clark the speaker of the house oppose the draft in woodrow wilson 's administration the chairman of the foreign relations committee with the exception of senator vandenberg almost invariably have find a great deal wrong with the executive in the field of foreign policy

 there be a division there and there be some frustration there

 those man express it and they have a right to they have a duty to do it

 but it be also the president 's duty to look and see what substance they have present how much they think it out what information they have how much knowledge they have receive from general westmoreland or ambassador bunker whoever it be how familiar they be with what be go on and whether you really think you ought to follow their judgment or follow the judgment of the other people

 i do that every day some day i have to say to our people let we try this plan that senator x have suggest and we do

 we be do that with the united nations resolution we have try several time to get the united nations to play a part in try to bring peace in vietnam

 the senate think that this be the way to do it more than 50 of they have sign a resolution

 the senate foreign relations committee have a big day yesterday they report two resolution in one day

 i have my view i have my view about really what those resolution will achieve but i also have an obligation to seriously and carefully consider the judgment of the other branch of the government and we be go to do it

 even though we may have some doubt about what will be accomplish that they think may be accomplish if it be a close question we will bend to try to meet their view because we think that be important

 we have already try the united nations before but we may try it again because they have hope and they believe that this be the answer we will do everything that we can to make it the answer

 i do not want to hurt its chance by give any prediction at this moment

 we will consider the view that everyone suggest

 thank you mr. president





mr. rather mr. president i think any american seat in this car tonight would want to ask you about peace do you have any fresh new idea about get peace in vietnam or be we stick with as i think secretary rusk have put it wait for some sign from the other side

 the president peace be the number 1 subject in the mind of every leader in the government we be search for it a part of every day

 we think that the people of south vietnam have demonstrate that they want to be govern on the basis of one man one vote and people who be prepared to live under that kind of an arrangement could live under that kind of arrangement

 the thing that we must recognize about peace be that it be much more than just wish for it you can not get it just because you want it if that be true we would have have it a long time ago because there be no people in the world who want peace more than the president the cabinet and the people of the united states

 but if we be to find the solution of unite the people of south vietnam and solve the problem in south vietnam it must be do not by some senator or congressman ryan or senator hartke or senator fulbright or some of our well intentione people who want peace this peace be go to be find by the leadership of south vietnam the people of south vietnam in south vietnam

 we be encourage that we be go to continue to do our dead level good to see this constitutional government where 70 percent of their people register and 60 percent of their people vote develop some kind of a plan that we think will ultimately unite south vietnam and bring peace to that area

 this will take time this will take patience this will take understanding

 the great problem we have be not mislead the enemy and let he think because of some of the statement he hear come from we that the way be cheap or that it be easy or that we be go to falter

 mr scherer mr. president there seem to be a grow impression throughout the world that the united states will settle for nothing less than military victory in vietnam what be your view on that

 the president i have just explain what i think would be a fair solution i will repeat it as briefly and as succinctly as i can

 the demilitarized zone must be respect as the 1954 agreement require the unity of vietnam as a whole must be a matter for peaceful adjustment and negotiation

 the north vietnamese force must get out of laos and stop infiltrate laos that be what the 1962 agreement require and it must be respect

 the overwhelming majority of the people of south vietnam want a one man one vote constitutional government

 about 70 percent of all the citizen who might have vote in south vietnam register in the election and 60 percent of they vote

 the 20 percent or so of the population now under vietcong control must live under a one man one vote constitutional system if there be to be peace

 president thieu have say that the south vietnamese government be not prepared to recognize the nlf as a government and it know well that nlf 's control be by hanoi and so do we

 but he also have say that he be prepare for informal talk with member of the nlf and that these could bring good result

 i think that be a statesmanlike position and i hope the other side will respond that be why or statement in early december say we believe that the south vietnamese must work out their own future act through electoral process of the kind carry forward in the last 2 year

 the political future of south vietnam mr. scherer must be work out in south vietnam by the people of south vietnam

 it be our judgment that this war could be end in a matter of week if the other side would face these five simple fact and if some of our own people here in this country would encourage that that be do instead of broadcasting alarm that may give false signal both to hanoi and to the vietcong

 mr rather mr. president be we willing to accept communists in a coalition government if the south vietnamese government and the nlf get together to negotiate be we willing to accept communists in a coalition government

 the president i think that the thing we must bear in mind that what happen in south vietnam be up to the people of south vietnam not to north vietnam not to china the soviet union or the united states but the people of south vietnam

 we be prepared to have every man in south vietnam under their constitutional government one man one vote for those people themselves to determine the kind of government they want we think we know what that determination would be from the 70 percent who be register and the 60 percent who have vote it be a matter for they to determine

 i think that we might add one other thing here when mr. reynolds say what be the minimum condition for this or that we do not want to get spar with each other

 but i can say that so far as the united states be concern we be ready to stop fight tonight if they be ready to stop fight but we be not ready to stop our side of the war only to encourage they to escalate their side of the war

 we will reciprocate and meet any move that they make but we be not go to be so softheaded and pudding head as to say that we will stop our half of the war and hope and pray that they stop theirs

 now we have try that in some instance we have lean over backwards every time we have they have escalate their effort and they have kill our soldier we have get no result from it a burn child dread the fire

 but if you want we to stop our bombing you have to ask they to stop their bombing stop their hand grenade stop their mortar

 at san antonio i lay out the formula and i say we will stop bomb immediately provide you will have prompt and productive discussion

 now that be about as far as anyone can go that be as far as anyone should go that be as far as we be go

 mr scherer mr. president be it your feeling that you have now make our proposition and the next move be up to they

 the president well it be my feeling that our position in the world be very clearly know if it be not i have try to repeat it enough tonight that the people can understand it

 mr reynolds mr. president what be your assessment of hanoi 's attitude at this point in the war do you believe they be count sir on your defeat next november

 the president i think that hanoi feel that if they can hold out long enough that they will not win a military victory against general westmoreland they have not do that they can not point to one single victory they win from our marines or from our air or from our navy or from our army

 they think though that they can repeat what happen to they with the french that if their will be strong and they continue to remain firm that they will develop enough sympathy and understanding in this country and hatred for war in this country that their will will outlast our will

 i do not think that be true i think in due time if our people will understand and recognize what be happen i think they will help i prove it be not true

 mr scherer mr. president just to make this abundantly clear what you seem to be say here tonight be a that peace in vietnam be principally up to the saigon government rather than the united states and b that the saigon government can have useful talk with the vietcong without recognize they

 the president yes i have say that i think the war could be stop in a matter of day if president thieu 's suggestion that he informally talk with member of the nlf be carry out and if they would agree to what they have already agree to in the 1954 accord and the 1962 accord and the other point that i mention this morning like one man one vote under the present constitutional government

 i think that would be a useful starting point and i think the result could be that we could find a way to stop the war

 mr rather mr. president i think what bother some people though be that president thieu and the south vietnamese government as it be now constitute say that they do not recognize the vietcong they do not recognize the nlf how be they go to have negotiation with they if they do not recognize they

 the president they could have informal talk with they dan i say that the president have make clear that he would not recognize nlf but we have make dear for many many month that their view can be hear and we can respond to they their recommendation can be receive and we can react to they

 president thieu himself in a very statesmanlike manner have say that he would be agreeable to have informal talk with their representative we would hope that out of that some understanding could be reach

 i believe if it could be reach the war could be bring to a close

 mr scherer mr. president much have be make of your 1964 campaign statement about not send american boy to fight in an asian war as you look back on that now be that a pledge a hope or be it simply a statement of principle in a large context

 the president well it be one of many statement if you will look back upon it as a part of a policy namely our policy then and now be to keep our hand out for negotiation and for discussion and for peace and our guard up that would support the south vietnamese to keep they from be envelop

 we make clear all through that campaign and in this speech which you have extract one little single sentence out of that we feel that the south vietnamese ought to pledge every resource they have their man their material all of their resource to defend themselves that we would never supplant they but we would supplement they to the extent that it be necessary

 we do not plan to go into asia and to fight an asian war that asians ought to be fight for themselves but if asians be fight it for themselves and be use all the resource that they have in south vietnam there be no pledge no commitment or no implication that we would not supplement they and support they as we be do and as we agree to do many year before in the seato treaty and as we have agree to do in the gulf of tonkin resolution before that statement

 mr rather mr. president if the south---

 the president that have just be a part of the politician gambit of pick out one sentence before you get to the but in it and say we be not go to take over all the fighting and do it ourselves we be not go to do what asian boy in south vietnam should do

 they be do it they have over 700,000 man there out of 17 million population and they be raise another 65,000 compare to the additional 40,000 odd that we be send

 so we do not plan to supplant they at all but we do plan to supplement they to whatever be necessary to keep the communist conspiracy from gobble up that nation

 mr rather mr. president if the south vietnamese be as dedicate to freedom as you say and as many who have be there say why be it that they do not fight as well motivated or at least seemingly as the vietcong and the communist north vietnamese

 to put it more bluntly why do not our south vietnamese fight as well as theirs

 the president i do not think that all people do everything alike i know some television broadcaster be well than other i know some president that can perform in a conversation well than other

 general abrams who be give leadership to the south vietnamese people think that their army be develop very well

 now that be not to say that they be equal to the good troop of every other nation but they have make great improvement they be work at their job they still have some problem to correct in leadership that be what really determine what kind of a fight force you have but they be get at it and they be get result

 it be mighty easy to blame someone else that be what we do i do not think we get much out of blame our ally or talk about how much well we be than they

 most of the people out there tell we that they believe that the south vietnamese army at this time be equal to the korean troop in 1954 if they be i do not think we will have to apologize too much for they they be take up their position on the dmz now

 they have be give very good result from their action general abrams think they be do all right i would prefer his judgment to anybody 's judgment and i know

 mr reynolds mr. president you have always credit the russians with a sincere desire for peace in vietnam do you still hold to that view if they really want peace why do not they stop supply the north vietnamese

 the president without go into your statement as to my view i would say this we be not sure just at this point of all that motivate the chinese or the russians or any of the other communists who be support the north vietnamese

 i do not think i could honestly tell you just what their motivation be we have always hope that they would like to see this war bring to an end that have be their indication to we whether that would work out in the long run i do not know

 mr scherer mr. president that bring we back to glassboro and your conversation this summer how much of factor in the restraint that we and the russians seem to show in the middle east crisis be a product of the dialogue that you establish with mr. kosygin at glassboro

 the president i think that the glassboro conference be a very useful conference i be not sure that it really solve any of the problem of the middle east i think the situation in the middle east be a very dangerous one

 i think we have make clear our viewpoint in my statement of june 19th the five condition that ought to enter into bring about peace in that area we stress those to mr. kosygin at glassboro he understand they he do not agree with they but i think that the soviet union understand that we feel very strongly about this matter that we do have definite view

 i think ambassador goldberg at the united nations have make our position very clear as a result of the action of the united nations in send ambassador jarring there as a mediator we be hopeful that the condition i outline on june 19th can be work out and that a permanent solution can be find to that very difficult problem

 i would say it be one of our most dangerous situation and one that be go to require the good tact judgment patience and willingness on the part of all to find a solution

 mr rather mr. president do you consider that this country have the same kind of unwavering commitment to defend israel against invasion as we have in south vietnam

 the president we do not have a seato treaty if that be what you be ask we have make clear our very definite interest in israel and our desire to preserve peace in that area of the world by many mean but we do not have a mutual security treaty with they as we do in southeast asia

 mr reynolds mr. president if we might come back for just a moment to the question of our relation with the soviet union it be often say that one of the most tragic consequence of the war in south vietnam be the setback in american soviet relation do you agree with that do you think we be make progress in get along

 the president well there be a good many thing say mr. reynolds that people have to take with a grain of salt first they ought to look at the source of these statement

 i have try to analyze our position in the world with other nation we do regret that we do not see everything alike with the soviet union or other nation we hope that there would not be this tension and these strain that frequently be in evidence now we do not say that everything be 100 percent all right because we have very definite and very strong difference of opinion and philosophy

 but if you be ask i if the tension exist today that exist when the berlin wall go up the answer be no

 now we can understand the soviet union 's inhibition and the problem they have as long as vietnam be take place they be call upon to support their communist brother and they be support he in a limited way with some equipment we wish that be not so

 we would hope that they would exercise their duty and their responsibility as cochairman and take some leadership and try to bring this war to an end

 but we do not think that thing be as tense or as serious or as dangerous as they be when the berlin wall go up in the cuban missile crisis or follow mr. kennedy 's visit with mr. khrushchev at vienna

 mr scherer mr. president move now to europe what about the complaint of europe that our preoccupation with vietnam have cause united states relation with europe to take a back seat

 the president i do not find that complaint in europe i find it in georgetown among a few columnist generally

 the european leader we be have very frequent exchange with they generally prime minister wilson will be here early in february he have be here several time

 we have be to germany and mr. kiesinger and ahead of he mr. erhard and ahead of he mr. adenauer have be here

 many of the scandinavian leader have come here

 the dutch leader have come here

 this year in europe we have have a very long agenda that have produce what we think be very excellent result we have just conclude an agreement on the kennedy round which involve very far reach trade concession we think it will stand as a monument to the relationship of the people of europe and the people of the united states and very much to both of their advantage

 we have a challenge of nato and general de gaulle ask we to get out of france we sit down with the other 14 member of nato the other european nation and we look at our problem we decide that we would go to belgium thirteen of those nation join the united states and 14 of we go there

 nato be now intact as solid as it can be unify secretary rusk have just return from very successful meeting with they

 so the challenge to nato have be rebuff the difficulty of the kennedy round have be solve the frequent prediction that the germans would reduce their troop strength 60,000 and we would bring our division back from europe those matter have be work out

 we be work feverishly every day try to bring about a nonproliferation agreement and we be make headway

 so i think if you take the result of this year 's effort in europe that most european statesman who have be engage in those effort would think we have be quite successful and probably more successful than any other period and i do not see that we have either ignore they or neglect they

 mr reynolds mr. president i wonder if we might turn to matter at home sir

 the civil right movement in this country be found and thrive on the principle of nonviolence now all that seem to be change there be people openly advocate violence we have violence last summer what be your explanation for these riot sir what happen

 the president i would say that not all of it be change i would say that all through our history as these change occur there have be violence connect with they

 we find that true in world war i. we find that true in world war ii we have a riot in detroit during president roosevelt 's administration where he have to send out troop that compare very much to the same one we have there this year

 we have this unrest we have this uncertainty we have this desire of people who have be hold down all these year to rise up and try to acquire quickly what have be deny they so unjustly so long

 we have more violence than we want and more than we should have more than we be go to be able to tolerate but i do not think that represent all the country at all i think that represent a very small minority

 i think our big problem be to get at the cause of these riot i think that some of the cause be the hope of the people themselves they do not have job they want job so we be go to have to provide job

 there be some half million unemployed hard core unemployed in our principal city we just have to go and find job for they

 i be go to call in the businessman of america and say one of two thing have to happen you have to help i go out here and find job for these people or we be go to have to find job in the government for they and offer every one of they a job i think that be one thing that could be do i think that will have to be do as expensive as it be

 second i think we will have to do something about the housing situation people live in filth in dilapidated house more new housing ought to be build and have to be build we have to find place to build that housing

 i have try to pass legislation that i think would be helpful such as the open housing bill i have try to encourage the congress to take action on model city and on rent supplement we have make progress although not as much as we would like so we be go to have to accelerate and step up rebuild our city so we can have decent housing

 in the field of education education have be deny to the poor on an equal basis for many year the poor child have not have the advantage because of lack of transportation because of the economic situation in their family because of a lot of reason their own health condition

 so they have not have the education and because of discrimination they have not have the educational opportunity that the other child have have

 so we be fast correct those we have triple our education program in 3 year and the poor have be the primary beneficiary we be spend three time as much on health today as we be 4 year ago and the poor be the primary beneficiary of medicare and medicaid they can have their hospital bill pay now they can have their doctor pay now

 as a result our infant mortality rate be go down as a result our death rate be go down we have make great progress with health and education they be important thing

 so i would say job health education and housing be all contribute to this general dissatisfaction that result in violence on occasion and we have to accelerate our effort there we have to appeal to these people to keep their feeling within bound and keep they lawful because every person in this country must obey the law of this country and there be no situation that justify your violate the law

 mr rather mr. president for those americans especially negroes who live in crowded area live in poverty with no education no job and seemingly no help why not follow an extremist why not revolt

 the president i tell you the reason why because revolting and violence be unlawful it be not go to be allow it do not solve the problem it be not the answer to the condition that exist

 the answer be job the answer be education the answer be health now if we refuse to give those answer people be go to lose hope and when they do it be pretty difficult to get they to be as reasonable as we think they should be

 but there be every reason why they should not violence be not go to produce more job violence be not go to produce more education violate the law and take the law into your own hand be not go to produce well health or well housing it be go to produce anarchy and that can not be tolerate

 mr rather some of these extremist mr. president say though that anarchy be exactly what we need that they want to tear down the fabric of this society

 the president i do not agree with the extremist and i hope you do not

 mr scherer mr. president what be your administration do now to see that we do not have another riot this summer

 the president i have outline that job housing education health all of these thing try to get at these problem we think that if we can have a program for the city like model city we think if we can have job like neighborhood youth training and the job program we be work out if we can find employment for all the hard core we think that this will answer some of the cause of the riot

 mr reynolds mr. president in the ghetto i think they say that be just talk white man 's talk what be your reaction to that

 the president you know what my reaction to it be

 mr reynolds be not there this sense of despair this grow estrangement between white and nonwhite

 the president what be your answer to it frank

 mr reynolds well i would hope that i do not know that my answer be necessarily the one sir that we want

 the president what be your answer though frank

 mr reynolds my answer be that it be not talk and that there will be an attempt make but can it come in time i be think of these young--

 the president if not what what be your solution what do you recommend

 mr reynolds what do you think you should do sir

 the president you be not go to answer it now you be not go to give we your recommendation or your thought

 mr reynolds my recommendation be to get go as fast as we possibly can on all the program that you have just mention

 the president that be what we be do we accept your recommendation and we will carry it out

 mr reynolds thank you sir

 mr scherer mr. president if this situation be as serious as we all think it be people say we be spend $ 30 billion a year in vietnam and why can not we spend $ 30 billion a year at home if you can not get program such as you be talk about through in this congress how will you get they through in the future how do we get a sense of urgency about it

 the president we hope that the congress will as these thing develop see the need of they we think we have make progress we could not get the model city program authorize and fund 2 year ago but we do this year we could not get rent supplement authorize and fund but we have this year we could not get the housing program that we have underway now authorize and fund 2 year ago but we have this year

 we be make progress we can not correct it overnight you can not take the error of 100 year and solve they in 100 day

 we would like to do as much as we can i be recommend a good deal more than the congress be willing to do

 in the poverty field i recommend and urge and ask every cabinet member to join we in do so we urge the congress to provide $ 2.2 billion in fund for poverty they cut it several hundred million dollar

 we have make recommendation for 40,000 rent supplement unit $ 40 million they cut it to $ 10 million i regret it if i could issue an executive order and vitiate it and put nay own program into effect i would do it

 but we be move in that direction and we be go to do all we can to accelerate it and to escalate it

 mr rather mr. president if i may let us turn to the subject of youth i think everyone expect youth to rebel and to be restless but there seem to be an unusually large number of american youth at this particular point in history who feel alienated to the traditional american idea of god patriotism and family do you sense this alienation what can be do about it

 the president yes i sense it i think we have that condition and we be try to meet it as well we know how i have see it several time in my lifetime

 i remember the day of the zoot suiter in world war ii i remember the doubter who think all of our youth be go to the dog because of the sit down movement in some of the plant in our country at certain period of our country i remember the doubt express about our ability in world war ii to take a bunch of beardless boy and resist hitler 's legion

 there have be some disappointment but i have visit the campus of this country my cabinet have go and meet with the young people of this country we deal with young folk every day in the peace corps in the poverty program in the vista program and in the job camp

 and i think it be a very small percentage that have give up who have lose faith who have deep question about the future of the country and of themselves

 we have more than 3 million young people serve in uniform i hear from about 100 of they every day they do not get the attention that you television people give these exhibitionist they do not have anyone to make sign for they and parade get their picture in the paper they be just there from daylight to dark fight for freedom and liberty and willing to die for it they be a pretty large number comparatively speak

 i doubt that there be anything like that many hippie or i doubt that there be that many disillusioned people if you add they all up and put they in one unit i think that they would make a very small percentage

 and i think anyone who think the youth of the country be go to the dog or imply it well take another look at it i have just go through two wedding this year and i have be associate with a lot of young people and the kind of young people i see whom i hear who write i be not the little group that you all can ferret out up here at some park or some place that have nothing to do but carry a sign around on their shoulder and try to obstruct someone else from get to a place or try to howl they down after they get there

 i think we have young people who be terribly upset at what be go on i know they hate war we all hate war but i think there be a very small percent who be go to take these extreme mean and go to employ these extreme way to express this lack of confidence in their future and in their country

 mr scherer mr. president how much of an inhibition do it give you as you go about the country to have to face these dissenter and demonstrator do you feel you can go where you want to go

 the president yes and do

 mr scherer do you think that will be true all through next year

 the president yes i think there have be a very subtle effort make by a few politician to suggest that it would be difficult for the president to travel it would be very dangerous probably the wish be father to the thought i think there have be some indication that certain organized group would try to bring embarrassment to the secretary of state by not let he talk or to the vice president by interrupt his talk

 but every time that have happen and it have be encourage some by some of the political group because we have follow they and have see that that have happen the people have be resound in their disapproval

 while we all recognize dissent and we expect it and we treat it respectfully we listen to it we do not think that dissent should be turn into hooliganism and we do not think because a person have a right to dissent that as a great justice one time say you have a right to holier fire in a crowded theater or that you have the right to tear a speaker 's necktie off or to put your hand over his mouth and prevent he from speak

 we think the dissent should be within the law and within the constitution we respect it when it be

 but if they be go to use storm trooper tactic it will be deal with and will be deal with properly

 if they be go to encourage folk to bring bodily harm to a president or to any other official that be sink very low and we do not think the people want to hear much like that either over the television in the form of suggestion or by some who be send to these campus to incite folk

 mr reynolds mr. president who be these people who be encourage this sort of thing do you see an element of subversion in it

 the president you see they on every campus on your television every night they be representative of various group i do not want to get personal and i do not want to give they advertisement but if you be interested just turn on abc tonight and look at the newscast a good part of every newscast you have will have some of these folk who be encourage the dissent appeal to they they will be parade they will have their sign they will be charge we with murder and this and that because we be try to carry out our obligation and our treaty commitment and protect that flag

 mr reynolds you feel sir apparently that the press the television radio the whole work give a disproportionate share of attention to this

 the president no i do not say that i say they report it and if you want to see it it be there for you to see it i do not say anything about disproportionate

 mr reynolds do you think we do sir

 the president well i think that be a matter for your judgment i do not think it be up to the president to be make up your newscast

 mr rather mr. president you have say i think mr. president that you welcome responsible dissent for those americans who do strongly dissent from your war policy but who want to be responsible and yet want to be effective what can you recommend what can they do

 the president well in the first place i be not in the business of recommend their program for they i have enough problem with my own program

 but we do have a way of people in this country express their viewpoint give out interview make speech have picketing i would say generally speak mr. rather be lawful abide by the law of the land do whatever the law will permit they to do

 i do not think you have to be a law violator in the name of the first amendment i do not think you be justify in be a law violator in order to have your right of free speech

 i think that the people who ought to want to follow the law and the constitution the most be the dissenter themselves because it be that law and that constitution which give they their right to dissent and protect that right

 i be amazed that some of these so call liberal folk who reserve for themselves the right to speak long loud and freely but when the opposition view be express they try to drown it out with catcall egg or tomato

 i do not understand that kind of behavior

 mr rather some of these dissenter say that the only way they can get your attention be to do something unlawful

 the president i be not familiar with that who say that

 mr rather there be mr. dellinger for one who lead the march on the pentagon who say there be no way to get the attention of the establishment that is the government

 the president i do not think that be correct at all we read the paper we see the television we read our correspondence we spend a good deal more time on that than we do out view what he be say or do at the pentagon

 mr scherer mr. president 1968 will soon be upon we i be wonder as you sit here in your rock chair whether you could tell we when you sit down to make your decision about run again what be the factor you be go to weigh

 the president i have not do that ray i think in due time i will cross that bridge until then i do not want to speculate about it

 mr scherer not even the factor

 the president until i do that i be not go to speculate about it

 mr reynolds mr. president you often say that the president have plenty of advice regardless of when you intend to leave this office and we know you be not go to tell we that what advice would you give to the man who do succeed you

 the president well i will do that when i leave it

 mr rather mr. president i know that with the campaign come up you do not want to get into politic too much but i would be remiss in my duty as a reporter if i do not ask you regardless of who the democratic candidate be in 1968 what effect do you think the candidacy of senator mccarthy and the position of senator robert kennedy will have on the democratic party

 the president i just do not know i do not know what the effect of the kennedy mccarthy movement be have in the country i be not a reporter i have not follow it i be not privileged to all the conversation that may have take place

 i just observe they have have some meeting and some discussion i do know of the interest of both of they in the presidency and the ambition of both of they i see that reflect from time to time

 but just what they be prepared to do how they be go to do it whether they be go to do it in concert or what will be the effect upon the american people of these maneuvering i be not prepared to say

 mr rather mr. president french president de gaulle in light of his picking at nato his attack on the dollar and now even training of russian troop do you consider he a friend or an enemy of this country

 the president i believe that the french people have an understanding an interest and affection for the american people and i think it be greatly reciprocate

 i be sorry that the relationship between the president and mr. de gaulle be not a close one and that we do not see matter alike any more often than we do we have try to do everything that we know to do to minimize the difference that exist in the leadership of the two government we strongly feel that the people of the two country have a long history of friendship and we be determined to preserve that

 we be also determined to minimize our difference and from my part to do nothing to unjustly or unduly provoke the french government

 mr rather to get precisely to the point about general de gaulle as apart from the french people--

 the president i get precisely to the point i do not want to do anything to accentuate aggravate or contribute to emphasize the difference that we have and strain the relation

 i think basically our people be friendly and i be go to do all i can to keep they friendly

 mr scherer mr. president the other day one of the elder statesman in our business give it as his view that unless you regain the trust of the people i think that be the way he put it you could not effectively govern how do that proposition strike you

 the president i think you must have the trust of the people i feel we do have the trust of the people i do think we have the support of the people the people in every election have have a chance to express themselves in a national election and have give we a majority vote

 in 1964 the last election we get 61 percent of the vote the high percentage any president ever obtain i be not talk about some individual poll in the last congressional election we have a majority in both house and senate

 now we lose some of our majority we lose some of our support i do not think there be any question about that in a preelection year you will always do that

 we look ahead of 1964 when they be have the san francisco convention i think a great many people toy with the idea of join or vote in the opposition party until they have the result of the convention until they see what would happen if you elect a republican and who would be bring into office the kind of government you would have and the kind of policy you would have

 i think there be some uncertainty in the country i think there be some division in the country i do not think that the opposition be in the majority and i do not think they will be on election day but i do not discount it and i do not ignore it

 mr scherer as you look ahead to the world that your grandson be go to grow up in what kind of a world would you like that to be

 the president i would hope that it would be a more knowledgeable world and a well educate world there be four people out of every 10 today who can not read cat who can not spell dog who can not recognize the print word mother i would like to see every boy and girl who be bear in the world have all the education that he or she can take

 we be make great gain in that direction in this country i would like to see other nation make great gain i would like to see an enlightened program of family planning available to all the people of the world

 i would like to see the problem of food production face up to and nation take the necessary step to try to provide the food that they be go to need to support their population

 i would like to see the miracle of health extend to all the people of the world as they be to the fellow who be operate on with the heart change the other day

 i know that the infant mortality rate be go down i should like to see it reflect in all the 110 nation

 in short i believe that our ancient enemy be ignorance and illiteracy be disease and bigotry i would like to see my descendant grow up in a world that be as educate as possible as healthy as science will permit as prepare to feed itself and which certainly have sufficient conservation force to permit enjoyable leisure for the people who work long and late

 and i think we be move to that end

 mr rather mr. president what do your expert tell you and what be your good estimate on the performance of the economy over the next few month consider that you do not get the tax increase that you once call absolutely essential to the health of the economy

 the president it be very hard to predict what be ahead the secretary of the treasury and the council of economic advisers and the budget director have make the good statement that they could to the ways and means committee

 we think the business activity be go to pick up we think there be go to be increase production we think it be very essential that we have a tax bill

 we look forward to continue prosperity we have have 82 month of unparalleled prosperity in this country long than any other period uninterrupted and we want to keep thing that way

 we think the most important thing to we from a domestic standpoint be to provide more job and we have add six million job in the last few year we think that those job ought to have good pay but that we should not increase our wage or our profit or our dividend beyond what the increase productivity justifie so that we can maintain some restraint on price

 and while we be not satisfied with the job we have do we have do a well job than any other country and we be urge both business and labor to take that into consideration in their negotiation with each other

 mr scherer mr. president what about china many people as they peer off into the midst of the future see our future problem with china if you could sit down with the ruler of china what would you tell they about america 's intention toward they

 the president i have say to they in several public statement that we hope that they can conduct themselves in such a way as will permit they to join the family of nation and that we can learn to live in harmony with each other

 we have no desire to be enemy of any nation in the world we believe that it be possible over the year for they to develop a well understanding of the world in which they live

 we think there be some very important thing take place right in china today that will contribute to we hope a well understanding and a more moderate approach to their neighbor in the world

 we have observe their failure in africa and in latin america and in southeast asia where they have undertake aggressive step that have result in failure for they and we hope they will profit by these experience we believe they will

 we do not know all that we would like to know about what be go on in china it be a rather close society and we do not have all the information that we would like to have but we be hopeful and we believe that over a period of time that the opportunity exist for they to gain a well understanding of the other people of the world and thus be able to live more harmoniously with they

 mr reynolds mr. president there be quite a dust up in this town recently perhaps more here than elsewhere about the resignation of secretary mcnamara be there anything more you can tell we about it

 the president no i can only repeat what secretary mcnamara say and what i have say

 secretary mcnamara have be secretary of defense long than any other man i think he have be the good secretary of defense that we have ever have i hate to see he leave as secretary of defense

 i take great satisfaction in the contribution that mr. mcnamara have make to the government he be only on sabbatical leave he be not go to be very far away from here and on anything that be remotely connect with the good interest of the world that the world bank be interested in we will be work very close together

 i do not consider that i have lose his service or the world have lose his talent or that i have lose a friend in any way i think that instead of build a great machine at the pentagon for the purpose of defend liberty and freedom that he will be busy at the world bank in the constructive purpose of build the economy and better humanity in these very nation that we be try to defend and i take forward with a great deal of pleasure to work very closely with he

 mr rather mr. president look ahead to next year this will be the final year of this term of your presidency what be your priority particularly in regard to congress can you get through do you feel any more of your great society program any more welfare program

 the president we will have detailed recommendation in our state of the union in connection with the problem the nation face there be many unresolved problem

 there will be substantial recommendation to the next congress there have be substantial achievement in this one

 we do not get everything we want at all we never have but we have a good congress we do not have as good a congress as we have in the 89th congress we do not pass as many substantive measure and they do not reach as far as the other they be curtail some because that be the mood of the congress and on a good many measure they be able to reduce our proposal

 they do not destroy model city they cripple it they cut it by several hundred million they do not destroy rent supplement but they cut it from $ 40 million to $ 10 million they do not destroy the rat bill they knock it out for a while and stagger it but after the senate work on it we approve it they do not recommit a good many of the bill but they reduce they

 they do not wipe out poverty but they reduce it from $ 2.2 billion several hundred million to $ 1.7 billion something

 so those be the thing that you have to face up to i be not say ugly thing about the individual those man think they be right they do not want to take some of these new program they do not want to fund model city rent supplement or face up to the urban requirement and what i think be 20th century requirement

 and i understand their philosophy i have understand it for 35 year they frequently be the preserver of stagnation and they want to keep thing as they be they do not want to move forward

 now i come into the executive branch with a man who say let us get the country move again now we have the country move again and we want to keep it move we be go to keep it move if we can get the congress support

 and while we do not get they to support we every time we want to we do move forward and we hope the next session will be a productive one too

 i be go to appeal to every republican in an election year to come in and do what be good for his country and if he do that without regard to how it might cripple the president without regard to the politic of the year then i think we will have a good congress

 i be go to do what i think be good for my country at home and abroad without regard to what effect it have on my future and if they will do the same thing we will have a good government a good country and then we can let the election take care of itself and i think we will have a good election

 thank you mr. president







 mr. speaker mr. president members of the congress and my fellow americans

 i be think as i be walk down the aisle tonight of what sam rayburn tell i many year ago the congress always extend a very warm welcome to the president as he come in

 thank all of you very very much

 i have come once again to this chamber the home of our democracy to give you as the constitution require information of the state of the union

 i report to you that our country be challenge at home and abroad

 --that it be our will that be be try not our strength our sense of purpose not our ability to achieve a well america

 --that we have the strength to meet our every challenge the physical strength to hold the course of decency and compassion at home and the moral strength to support the cause of peace in the world

 and i report to you that i believe with abide conviction that this people nurture by their deep faith tutor by their hard lesson move by their high aspiration have the will to meet the trial that these time impose

 since i report to you last january

 --three election have be hold in vietnam in the midst of war and under the constant threat of violence

 --a president a vice president a house and senate and village official have be choose by popular contested ballot

 --the enemy have be defeat in battle after battle

 --the number of south vietnamese live in area under government protection tonight have grow by more than a million since january of last year

 these be all mark of progress yet

 --the enemy continue to pour man and material across frontier and into battle despite his continuous heavy loss

 --he continue to hope that america 's will to persevere can be break well he be wrong america will persevere our patience and our perseverance will match our power aggression will never prevail

 but our goal be peace and peace at the early possible moment

 right now we be explore the meaning of hanoi 's recent statement there be no mystery about the question which must be answer before the bombing be stop

 we believe that any talk should follow the san antonio formula that i state last september which say

 --the bombing would stop immediately if talk would take place promptly and with reasonable hope that they would be productive

 --and the other side must not take advantage of our restraint as they have in the past this nation simply can not accept anything less without jeopardize the life of our man and of our ally

 if a basis for peace talk can be establish on the san antonio foundation and it be my hope and my prayer that they can we would consult with our ally and with the other side to see if a complete cessation of hostility a really true cease fire could be make the first order of business i will report at the early possible moment the result of these exploration to the american people

 i have just recently return from a very fruitful visit and talk with his holiness the pope and i share his hope as he express it early today that both side will extend themselves in an effort to bring an end to the war in vietnam i have today assure he that we and our ally will do our full part to bring this about

 since i speak to you last january other event have occur that have major consequence for world peace

 --the kennedy round achieve the great reduction in tariff barrier in all the history of trade negotiation

 --the nation of latin america at punta del este resolve to move toward economic integration

 --in asia the nation from korea and japan to indonesia and singapore work behind america 's shield to strengthen their economy and to broaden their political cooperation

 --in africa from which the distinguished vice president have just return he report to i that there be a spirit of regional cooperation that be begin to take hold in very practical way

 these event we all welcome yet since i last report to you we and the world have be confront by a number of crisis

 --dure the arab israeli war last june the hot line between washington and moscow be use for the first time in our history a cease fire be achieve without a major power confrontation

 now the nation of the middle east have the opportunity to cooperate with ambassador jarring 's u.n. mission and they have the responsibility to find the term of live together in stable peace and dignity and we shall do all in our power to help they achieve that result

 --not far from this scene of conflict a crisis flare on cyprus involve two people who be america 's friend greece and turkey our very able representative mr. cyrus vance and other help to ease this tension

 --turmoil continue on the mainland of china after a year of violent disruption the radical extremism of their government have isolate the chinese people behind their own border the united states however remain willing to permit the travel of journalist to both our country to undertake cultural and educational exchange and to talk about the exchange of basic food crop material

 since i speak to you last the united states and the soviet union have take several important step toward the goal of international cooperation

 as you will remember i meet with chairman kosygin at glassboro and we achieve if not accord at least a clear understanding of our respective position after 2 day of meeting

 because we believe the nuclear danger must be narrow we have work with the soviet union and with other nation to reach an agreement that will halt the spread of nuclear weapon on the basis of communication from ambassador fisher in geneva this afternoon i be encourage to believe that a draft treaty can be lay before the conference in geneva in the very near future i hope to be able to present that treaty to the senate this year for the senate 's approval

 we achieve in 1967 a consular treaty with the soviets the first commercial air agreement between the two country and a treaty ban weapon in outer space we shall sign and submit to the senate shortly a new treaty with the soviets and with other for the protection of astronaut

 serious difference still remain between we yet in these relation we have make some progress since vienna the berlin wall and the cuban missile crisis

 but despite this progress we must maintain a military force that be capable of deter any threat to this nation 's security whatever the mode of aggression our choice must not be confine to total war or to total acquiescence

 we have such a military force today we shall maintain it

 i wish with all of my heart that the expenditure that be necessary to build and to protect our power could all be devoted to the program of peace but until world condition permit and until peace be assure america 's might and america 's brave son who wear our nation 's uniform must continue to stand guard for all of we as they gallantly do tonight in vietnam and other place in the world

 yet neither great weapon nor individual courage can provide the condition of peace

 for two decade america have commit itself against the tyranny of want and ignorance in the world that threaten the peace we shall sustain that commitment this year i shall propose

 --that we launch with other nation an exploration of the ocean depth to tap its wealth and its energy and its abundance

 --that we contribute our fair share to a major expansion of the international development association and to increase the resource of the asian development bank

 --that we adopt a prudent aid program root in the principle of self help

 --that we renew and extend the food for freedom program

 our food program have already help million avoid the horror of famine

 but unless the rapid growth of population in develop country be slow the gap between rich and poor will widen steadily

 government in the develop country must take such fact into consideration we in the united states be prepared to help assist they in those effort

 but we must also improve the life of child already bear in the village and town and city on this earth they can be teach by great teacher through space communication and the miracle of satellite television and we be go to bring to bear every resource of mind and technology to help make this dream come true

 let i speak now about some matter here at home

 tonight our nation be accomplish more for its people than have ever be accomplish before americans be prosperous as man have never be in record history yet there be in the land a certain restlessness a questioning

 the total of our nation 's annual production be now above $ 800 billion for 83 month this nation have be on a steady upward trend of growth

 all about they most american family can see the evidence of grow abundance high paycheck hum factory new car move down new highway more and more family own their own home equip with more than 70 million television set

 a new college be found every week today more than half of the high school graduate go on to college

 there be hundred of thousand of father and mother who never complete grammar school who will see their child graduate from college

 why then this restlessness

 because when a great ship cut through the sea the water be always stir and trouble

 and our ship be move it be move through troubled and new water it be move toward new and well shore

 we ask now not how can we achieve abundance?--but how shall we use our abundance not be there abundance enough for all?--but how can all share in our abundance

 while we have accomplish much much remain for we to meet and much remain for we to master

 --in some area the jobless rate be still three or four time the national average

 --violence have show its face in some of our city

 --crime increase on our street

 --income for farm worker remain far behind that for urban worker and parity for our farmer who produce our food be still just a hope not an achievement

 --new housing construction be far less than we need to assure decent shelter for every family

 --hospital and medical cost be high and they be rise

 --many river and the air in many city remain badly polluted and our citizen suffer from breathe that air

 we have live with condition like these for many many year but much that we once accept as inevitable we now find absolutely intolerable

 in our city last summer we see how wide be the gulf for some americans between the promise and the reality of our society

 we know that we can not change all of this in a day it represent the bitter consequence of more than three century

 but the issue be not whether we can change this the issue be whether we will change this

 well i know we can and i believe we will

 this then be the work we should do in the month that be ahead of we in this congress

 the first essential be more job useful job for ten of thousand who can become productive and can pay their own way

 our economy have create 7 1/2 million new job in the past 4 year it be add more than a million and a half new job this year

 through program pass by the congress job training be be give tonight to more than a million americans in this country

 this year the time have come when we must get to those who be last in line the hard core unemployed the hard to reach

 employment official estimate that 500,000 of these person be now unemployed in the major city of america our objective be to place these 500,000 in private industry job within the next 3 year

 to do this i propose a $ 2 1 billion manpower program in the come fiscal year a 25 percent increase over the current year most of this increase will be use to start a new partnership between government and private industry to train and to hire the hard core unemployed person i know of no task before we of more importance to we to the country or to our future

 another essential be to rebuild our city

 last year the congress authorize $ 662 million for the model cities program i request the full amount of that authorization to help meet the crisis in the city of america but the congress appropriate only $ 312 million less than half

 this year i urge the congress to honor my request for model city fund to rebuild the center of american city by grant we the full amount that you in the congress authorized--$1 billion

 the next essential be more housing and more housing now

 surely a nation that can go to the moon can place a decent home within the reach of its family

 therefore we must call together the resource of industry and labor to start build 300,000 housing unit for low- and middle income family next year that be three time more than this year we must make it possible for thousand of family to become homeowner not rent payer

 i propose for the consideration of this congress a 10 year campaign to build 6 million new housing unit for low and middle income family six million unit in the next 10 year we have build 530,000 the last 10 year

 well health for our child all of our child be essential if we be to have a well america

 last year medicare medicaid and other new program that you pass in the congress bring well health to more than 25 million americans

 american medicine with the very strong support and cooperation of public resource have produce a phenomenal decline in the death rate from many of the dread disease

 but it be a shocking fact that in save the life of baby america rank 15th among the nation of the world and among child crippling defect be often discover too late for any corrective action this be a tragedy that americans can and americans should prevent

 i shall therefore propose to the congress a child health program to provide over the next 5 year for family unable to afford it access to health service from prenatal care of the mother through the child 's first year

 when we do that you will find it be the good investment we ever make because we will get these disease in their infancy and we will find a cure in a great many instance that we can never find by overcrowd our hospital when they be grow

 now when we act to advance the consumer 's cause i think we help every american

 last year with very little fanfare the congress and the executive branch move in that field

 we enact the wholesome meat act the flammable fabrics act the product safety commission and a law to improve clinical laboratory

 and now i think the time have come to complete our unfinished work the senate have already pass the truth in lending bill the fire safety bill and the pipeline safety law

 tonight i plead with the house to immediately act upon these measure and i hope take favorable action upon all of they i call upon the congress to enact without delay the remainder of the 12 vital consumer protection law that i submit to the congress last year

 i also urge final action on a measure that be already pass by the house to guard against fraud and manipulation in the nation 's commodity exchange market

 these measure be a pledge to our people to keep they safe in their home and at work and to give they a fair deal in the marketplace

 and i think we must do more i propose

 --new power for the federal trade commission to stop those who defraud and who swindle our public

 --new safeguard to insure the quality of fish and poultry and the safety of our community water supply

 --a major study of automobile insurance

 --protection against hazardous radiation from television set and other electronic equipment

 and to give the consumer a strong voice i plan to appoint a consumer counsel in the justice department a lawyer for the american consumer to work directly under the attorney general to serve the president 's special assistant for consumer affairs and to serve the consumer of this land

 this congress democrats and republicans can earn the thank of history we can make this truly a new day for the american consumer and by give he this protection we can live in history as the consumer conscious congress

 so let we get on with the work let we act soon

 we at every level of the government state local federal know that the american people have have enough of rise crime and lawlessness in this country

 they recognize that law enforcement be first the duty of local police and local government

 they recognize that the frontline headquarters against crime be in the home the church the city hall and the county courthouse and the statehouse not in the far remove national capital of washington

 but the people also recognize that the national government can and the national government should help the city and the states in their war on crime to the full extent of its resource and its constitutional authority and this we shall do

 this do not mean a national police force it do mean help and financial support

 --to develop state and local master plan to combat crime

 --to provide well training and well pay for police and

 --to bring the most advanced technology to the war on crime in every city and every county in america

 there be no more urgent business before this congress than to pass the safe streets act this year that i propose last year that law will provide these require fund they be so critically need that i have double my request under this act to $ 100 million in fiscal 1969

 and i urge the congress to stop the trade in mail order murder to stop it this year by adopt a proper gun control law

 this year i will propose a drug control act to provide strict penalty for those who traffic in lsd and other dangerous drug with our people

 i will ask for more vigorous enforcement of all of our drug law by increase the number of federal drug and narcotic control official by more than 30 percent the time have come to stop the sale of slavery to the young i also request you to give we fund to add immediately 100 assistant united states attorney throughout the land to help prosecute our criminal law we have increase our judiciary by 40 percent and we have increase our prosecutor by 16 percent the docket be full of case because we do not have assistant district attorney to go before the federal judge and handle they we start these young lawyer at $ 8,200 a year and the docket be clog because we do not have authority to hire more of they

 i ask the congress for authority to hire 100 more these young man will give special attention to this drug abuse too

 finally i ask you to add 100 fbi agent to strengthen law enforcement in the nation and to protect the individual right of every citizen

 a moment ago i speak of despair and frustrated hope in the city where the fire of disorder burn last summer we can and in time we will change that despair into confidence and change those frustration into achievement but violence will never bring progress

 we can make progress only by attack the cause of violence and only where there be civil order found on justice

 today we be help local official improve their capacity to deal promptly with disorder

 those who preach disorder and those who preach violence must know that local authority be able to resist they swiftly to resist they sternly and to resist they decisively

 i shall recommend other action

 --to raise the farmer income by establish a security commodity reserve that will protect the market from price depress stock and protect the consumer from food scarcity

 --i shall recommend program to help farmer bargain more effectively for fair price

 --i shall recommend program for new air safety measure

 --measure to stem the rise cost of medical care

 --legislation to encourage our return veteran to devote themselves to career in community service such as teaching and be fireman and join our police force and our law enforcement official

 --i shall recommend program to strengthen and finance our anti pollution effort

 --fully fund all of the $ 2.18 billion poverty program that you in the congress have just authorize in order to bring opportunity to those who have be leave far behind

 --i shall recommend an educational opportunity act to speed up our drive to break down the financial barrier that be separate our young people from college

 i shall also urge the congress to act on several other vital pende bill especially the civil right measure fair jury trial protection of federal right enforcement of equal employment opportunity and fair housing

 the unfinished work of the first session must be complete the higher education act the juvenile delinquency act conservation measure to save the redwood of california and to preserve the wonder of our scenic river the highway beautification act and all the other measure for a clean and for a well and for a more beautiful america

 next month we will begin our 8th year of uninterrupted prosperity the economic outlook for this year be one of steady growth if we be vigilant

 true there be some cloud on the horizon price be rise interest rate have pass the peak of 1966 and if there be continue inaction on the tax bill they will climb even higher

 i warn the congress and the nation tonight that this failure to act on the tax bill will sweep we into an accelerate spiral of price increase a slump in homebuilding and a continue erosion of the american dollar

 this would be a tragedy for every american family and i predict that if this happen they will all let we know about it

 we those of we in the executive branch in the congress and the leader of labor and business must do everything we can to prevent that kind of misfortune

 under the new budget the expenditure for 1969 will increase by $ 10.4 billion receipt will increase by $ 22.3 billion include the add tax revenue virtually all of this expenditure increase represent the mandatory cost of our defense effort $ 3 billion increase interest almost $ 1 billion or mandatory payment under law pass by congress such as those provide in the social security act that you pass in 1967 and to medicare and medicaid beneficiary veteran and farmer of about $ 4 1/2 billion and the additional $ 1 billion 600 million next year for the pay increase that you pass in military and civilian pay that make up the $ 10 billion that be add to the budget with few exception very few we be hold the fiscal 1969 budget to last year 's level outside of those mandatory and require increase

 a presidential commission compose of distinguished congressional fiscal leader and other prominent americans recommend this year that we adopt a new budget approach i be carry out their recommendation in this year 's budget this budget therefore for the first time accurately cover all federal expenditure and all federal receipt include for the first time in one budget $ 47 billion from the social security medicare highway and other trust fund

 the fiscal 1969 budget have expenditure of approximately $ 186 billion with total estimate revenue include the tax bill of about $ 178 billion

 if the congress enact the tax increase we will reduce the budget deficit by some $ 12 billion the war in vietnam be cost we about $ 25 billion and we be ask for about $ 12 billion in taxis and if we get that $ 12 billion tax bill we will reduce the deficit from about $ 20 billion in 1968 to about $ 8 billion in 1969

 now this be a tight budget it follow the reduction that i make in cooperation with the congress a reduction make after you have review every appropriation bill and reduce the appropriation by some $ 5 or $ 6 billion and expenditure by $ 1.5 billion we confer together and i recommend to the congress and you subsequently approve take 2 percent from payroll and 10 percent from controllable expenditure we therefore reduce appropriation almost $ 10 billion last session and expenditure over $ 4 billion now that be in the budget last year

 i ask the congress to recognize that there be certain select program that meet the nation 's most urgent need and they have increase we have insist that decrease in very desirable but less urgent program be make before we would approve any increase so i ask the congress tonight

 --to hold its appropriation to the budget request and

 --to act responsibly early this year by enact the tax surcharge which for the average american individual amount to about a penny out of each dollar 's income

 this tax increase would yield about half of the $ 23 billion per year that we return to the people in the tax reduction bill of 1964 and 1965

 this must be a temporary measure which expire in less than 2 year congress can repeal it soon if the need have pass but congress can never repeal inflation

 the leader of american business and the leader of american labor those who really have power over wage and price must act responsibly and in their nation 's interest by keep increase in line with productivity if our recognize leader do not do this they and those for whom they speak and all of we be go to suffer very serious consequence

 on january 1st i outline a program to reduce our balance of payment deficit sharply this year we will ask the congress to help carry out those part of the program which require legislation we must restore equilibrium to our balance of payment

 we must also strengthen the international monetary system we have assure the world that america 's full gold stock stand behind our commitment to maintain the price of gold at $ 35 an ounce we must back this commitment by legislate now to free our gold reserve

 americans travel more than any other people in history take $ 4 billion out of their country last year in travel cost we must try to reduce the travel deficit that we have of more than $ 2 billion we be hope that we can reduce it by $ 500 million without unduly penalize the travel of teacher student business people who have essential and necessary travel or people who have relative abroad whom they want to see even with this reduction of $ 500 million the american people will still be travel more overseas than they do in 1967 1966 or 1965 or any other year in their history

 if we act together as i hope we can i believe we can continue our economic expansion which have already break all past record and i hope that we can continue that expansion in the day ahead

 each of these question i have discuss with you tonight be a question of policy for our people therefore each of they should be and doubtless will be debate by candidate for public office this year

 i hope those debate will be mark by new proposal and by a seriousness that match the gravity of the question themselves

 these be not appropriate subject for narrow partisan oratory they go to the heart of what we americans be all about all of we democrats and republicans

 tonight i have speak of some of the goal i should like to see america reach many of they can be achieve this year other by the time we celebrate our nation 's 200th birthday the bicentennial of our independence

 several of these goal be go to be very hard to reach but the state of our union will be much strong 8 year from now on our 200th birthday if we resolve to reach these goal now they be more important much more important than the identity of the party or the president who will then be in office

 these goal be what the fighting and our alliance be really mean to protect

 can we achieve these goal

 of course we can if we will

 if ever there be a people who seek more than mere abundance it be our people

 if ever there be a nation that be capable of solve its problem it be this nation

 if ever there be a time to know the pride and the excitement and the hope of be an american it be this time

 so this my friend be the state of our union seek building test many time in this past year and always equal to the test

 thank you and good night



 mr. speaker mr. president members of the congress and my fellow americans

 i be think as i be walk down the aisle tonight of what sam rayburn tell i many year ago the congress always extend a very warm welcome to the president as he come in

 thank all of you very very much

 i have come once again to this chamber the home of our democracy to give you as the constitution require information of the state of the union

 i report to you that our country be challenge at home and abroad

 --that it be our will that be be try not our strength our sense of purpose not our ability to achieve a well america

 --that we have the strength to meet our every challenge the physical strength to hold the course of decency and compassion at home and the moral strength to support the cause of peace in the world

 and i report to you that i believe with abide conviction that this people nurture by their deep faith tutor by their hard lesson move by their high aspiration have the will to meet the trial that these time impose

 since i report to you last january

 --three election have be hold in vietnam in the midst of war and under the constant threat of violence

 --a president a vice president a house and senate and village official have be choose by popular contested ballot

 --the enemy have be defeat in battle after battle

 --the number of south vietnamese live in area under government protection tonight have grow by more than a million since january of last year

 these be all mark of progress yet

 --the enemy continue to pour man and material across frontier and into battle despite his continuous heavy loss

 --he continue to hope that america 's will to persevere can be break well he be wrong america will persevere our patience and our perseverance will match our power aggression will never prevail

 but our goal be peace and peace at the early possible moment

 right now we be explore the meaning of hanoi 's recent statement there be no mystery about the question which must be answer before the bombing be stop

 we believe that any talk should follow the san antonio formula that i state last september which say

 --the bombing would stop immediately if talk would take place promptly and with reasonable hope that they would be productive

 --and the other side must not take advantage of our restraint as they have in the past this nation simply can not accept anything less without jeopardize the life of our man and of our ally

 if a basis for peace talk can be establish on the san antonio foundation and it be my hope and my prayer that they can we would consult with our ally and with the other side to see if a complete cessation of hostility a really true cease fire could be make the first order of business i will report at the early possible moment the result of these exploration to the american people

 i have just recently return from a very fruitful visit and talk with his holiness the pope and i share his hope as he express it early today that both side will extend themselves in an effort to bring an end to the war in vietnam i have today assure he that we and our ally will do our full part to bring this about

 since i speak to you last january other event have occur that have major consequence for world peace

 --the kennedy round achieve the great reduction in tariff barrier in all the history of trade negotiation

 --the nation of latin america at punta del este resolve to move toward economic integration

 --in asia the nation from korea and japan to indonesia and singapore work behind america 's shield to strengthen their economy and to broaden their political cooperation

 --in africa from which the distinguished vice president have just return he report to i that there be a spirit of regional cooperation that be begin to take hold in very practical way

 these event we all welcome yet since i last report to you we and the world have be confront by a number of crisis

 --dure the arab israeli war last june the hot line between washington and moscow be use for the first time in our history a cease fire be achieve without a major power confrontation

 now the nation of the middle east have the opportunity to cooperate with ambassador jarring 's u.n. mission and they have the responsibility to find the term of live together in stable peace and dignity and we shall do all in our power to help they achieve that result

 --not far from this scene of conflict a crisis flare on cyprus involve two people who be america 's friend greece and turkey our very able representative mr. cyrus vance and other help to ease this tension

 --turmoil continue on the mainland of china after a year of violent disruption the radical extremism of their government have isolate the chinese people behind their own border the united states however remain willing to permit the travel of journalist to both our country to undertake cultural and educational exchange and to talk about the exchange of basic food crop material

 since i speak to you last the united states and the soviet union have take several important step toward the goal of international cooperation

 as you will remember i meet with chairman kosygin at glassboro and we achieve if not accord at least a clear understanding of our respective position after 2 day of meeting

 because we believe the nuclear danger must be narrow we have work with the soviet union and with other nation to reach an agreement that will halt the spread of nuclear weapon on the basis of communication from ambassador fisher in geneva this afternoon i be encourage to believe that a draft treaty can be lay before the conference in geneva in the very near future i hope to be able to present that treaty to the senate this year for the senate 's approval

 we achieve in 1967 a consular treaty with the soviets the first commercial air agreement between the two country and a treaty ban weapon in outer space we shall sign and submit to the senate shortly a new treaty with the soviets and with other for the protection of astronaut

 serious difference still remain between we yet in these relation we have make some progress since vienna the berlin wall and the cuban missile crisis

 but despite this progress we must maintain a military force that be capable of deter any threat to this nation 's security whatever the mode of aggression our choice must not be confine to total war or to total acquiescence

 we have such a military force today we shall maintain it

 i wish with all of my heart that the expenditure that be necessary to build and to protect our power could all be devoted to the program of peace but until world condition permit and until peace be assure america 's might and america 's brave son who wear our nation 's uniform must continue to stand guard for all of we as they gallantly do tonight in vietnam and other place in the world

 yet neither great weapon nor individual courage can provide the condition of peace

 for two decade america have commit itself against the tyranny of want and ignorance in the world that threaten the peace we shall sustain that commitment this year i shall propose

 --that we launch with other nation an exploration of the ocean depth to tap its wealth and its energy and its abundance

 --that we contribute our fair share to a major expansion of the international development association and to increase the resource of the asian development bank

 --that we adopt a prudent aid program root in the principle of self help

 --that we renew and extend the food for freedom program

 our food program have already help million avoid the horror of famine

 but unless the rapid growth of population in develop country be slow the gap between rich and poor will widen steadily

 government in the develop country must take such fact into consideration we in the united states be prepared to help assist they in those effort

 but we must also improve the life of child already bear in the village and town and city on this earth they can be teach by great teacher through space communication and the miracle of satellite television and we be go to bring to bear every resource of mind and technology to help make this dream come true

 let i speak now about some matter here at home

 tonight our nation be accomplish more for its people than have ever be accomplish before americans be prosperous as man have never be in record history yet there be in the land a certain restlessness a questioning

 the total of our nation 's annual production be now above $ 800 billion for 83 month this nation have be on a steady upward trend of growth

 all about they most american family can see the evidence of grow abundance high paycheck hum factory new car move down new highway more and more family own their own home equip with more than 70 million television set

 a new college be found every week today more than half of the high school graduate go on to college

 there be hundred of thousand of father and mother who never complete grammar school who will see their child graduate from college

 why then this restlessness

 because when a great ship cut through the sea the water be always stir and trouble

 and our ship be move it be move through troubled and new water it be move toward new and well shore

 we ask now not how can we achieve abundance?--but how shall we use our abundance not be there abundance enough for all?--but how can all share in our abundance

 while we have accomplish much much remain for we to meet and much remain for we to master

 --in some area the jobless rate be still three or four time the national average

 --violence have show its face in some of our city

 --crime increase on our street

 --income for farm worker remain far behind that for urban worker and parity for our farmer who produce our food be still just a hope not an achievement

 --new housing construction be far less than we need to assure decent shelter for every family

 --hospital and medical cost be high and they be rise

 --many river and the air in many city remain badly polluted and our citizen suffer from breathe that air

 we have live with condition like these for many many year but much that we once accept as inevitable we now find absolutely intolerable

 in our city last summer we see how wide be the gulf for some americans between the promise and the reality of our society

 we know that we can not change all of this in a day it represent the bitter consequence of more than three century

 but the issue be not whether we can change this the issue be whether we will change this

 well i know we can and i believe we will

 this then be the work we should do in the month that be ahead of we in this congress

 the first essential be more job useful job for ten of thousand who can become productive and can pay their own way

 our economy have create 7 1/2 million new job in the past 4 year it be add more than a million and a half new job this year

 through program pass by the congress job training be be give tonight to more than a million americans in this country

 this year the time have come when we must get to those who be last in line the hard core unemployed the hard to reach

 employment official estimate that 500,000 of these person be now unemployed in the major city of america our objective be to place these 500,000 in private industry job within the next 3 year

 to do this i propose a $ 2 1 billion manpower program in the come fiscal year a 25 percent increase over the current year most of this increase will be use to start a new partnership between government and private industry to train and to hire the hard core unemployed person i know of no task before we of more importance to we to the country or to our future

 another essential be to rebuild our city

 last year the congress authorize $ 662 million for the model cities program i request the full amount of that authorization to help meet the crisis in the city of america but the congress appropriate only $ 312 million less than half

 this year i urge the congress to honor my request for model city fund to rebuild the center of american city by grant we the full amount that you in the congress authorized--$1 billion

 the next essential be more housing and more housing now

 surely a nation that can go to the moon can place a decent home within the reach of its family

 therefore we must call together the resource of industry and labor to start build 300,000 housing unit for low- and middle income family next year that be three time more than this year we must make it possible for thousand of family to become homeowner not rent payer

 i propose for the consideration of this congress a 10 year campaign to build 6 million new housing unit for low and middle income family six million unit in the next 10 year we have build 530,000 the last 10 year

 well health for our child all of our child be essential if we be to have a well america

 last year medicare medicaid and other new program that you pass in the congress bring well health to more than 25 million americans

 american medicine with the very strong support and cooperation of public resource have produce a phenomenal decline in the death rate from many of the dread disease

 but it be a shocking fact that in save the life of baby america rank 15th among the nation of the world and among child crippling defect be often discover too late for any corrective action this be a tragedy that americans can and americans should prevent

 i shall therefore propose to the congress a child health program to provide over the next 5 year for family unable to afford it access to health service from prenatal care of the mother through the child 's first year

 when we do that you will find it be the good investment we ever make because we will get these disease in their infancy and we will find a cure in a great many instance that we can never find by overcrowd our hospital when they be grow

 now when we act to advance the consumer 's cause i think we help every american

 last year with very little fanfare the congress and the executive branch move in that field

 we enact the wholesome meat act the flammable fabrics act the product safety commission and a law to improve clinical laboratory

 and now i think the time have come to complete our unfinished work the senate have already pass the truth in lending bill the fire safety bill and the pipeline safety law

 tonight i plead with the house to immediately act upon these measure and i hope take favorable action upon all of they i call upon the congress to enact without delay the remainder of the 12 vital consumer protection law that i submit to the congress last year

 i also urge final action on a measure that be already pass by the house to guard against fraud and manipulation in the nation 's commodity exchange market

 these measure be a pledge to our people to keep they safe in their home and at work and to give they a fair deal in the marketplace

 and i think we must do more i propose

 --new power for the federal trade commission to stop those who defraud and who swindle our public

 --new safeguard to insure the quality of fish and poultry and the safety of our community water supply

 --a major study of automobile insurance

 --protection against hazardous radiation from television set and other electronic equipment

 and to give the consumer a strong voice i plan to appoint a consumer counsel in the justice department a lawyer for the american consumer to work directly under the attorney general to serve the president 's special assistant for consumer affairs and to serve the consumer of this land

 this congress democrats and republicans can earn the thank of history we can make this truly a new day for the american consumer and by give he this protection we can live in history as the consumer conscious congress

 so let we get on with the work let we act soon

 we at every level of the government state local federal know that the american people have have enough of rise crime and lawlessness in this country

 they recognize that law enforcement be first the duty of local police and local government

 they recognize that the frontline headquarters against crime be in the home the church the city hall and the county courthouse and the statehouse not in the far remove national capital of washington

 but the people also recognize that the national government can and the national government should help the city and the states in their war on crime to the full extent of its resource and its constitutional authority and this we shall do

 this do not mean a national police force it do mean help and financial support

 --to develop state and local master plan to combat crime

 --to provide well training and well pay for police and

 --to bring the most advanced technology to the war on crime in every city and every county in america

 there be no more urgent business before this congress than to pass the safe streets act this year that i propose last year that law will provide these require fund they be so critically need that i have double my request under this act to $ 100 million in fiscal 1969

 and i urge the congress to stop the trade in mail order murder to stop it this year by adopt a proper gun control law

 i ask the congress for authority to hire 100 more these young man will give special attention to this drug abuse too

 finally i ask you to add 100 fbi agent to strengthen law enforcement in the nation and to protect the individual right of every citizen

 a moment ago i speak of despair and frustrated hope in the city where the fire of disorder burn last summer we can and in time we will change that despair into confidence and change those frustration into achievement but violence will never bring progress

 we can make progress only by attack the cause of violence and only where there be civil order found on justice

 today we be help local official improve their capacity to deal promptly with disorder

 those who preach disorder and those who preach violence must know that local authority be able to resist they swiftly to resist they sternly and to resist they decisively

 i shall recommend other action

 the unfinished work of the first session must be complete the higher education act the juvenile delinquency act conservation measure to save the redwood of california and to preserve the wonder of our scenic river the highway beautification act and all the other measure for a clean and for a well and for a more beautiful america

 next month we will begin our 8th year of uninterrupted prosperity the economic outlook for this year be one of steady growth if we be vigilant

 true there be some cloud on the horizon price be rise interest rate have pass the peak of 1966 and if there be continue inaction on the tax bill they will climb even higher

 i warn the congress and the nation tonight that this failure to act on the tax bill will sweep we into an accelerate spiral of price increase a slump in homebuilding and a continue erosion of the american dollar

 this would be a tragedy for every american family and i predict that if this happen they will all let we know about it

 we those of we in the executive branch in the congress and the leader of labor and business must do everything we can to prevent that kind of misfortune

 under the new budget the expenditure for 1969 will increase by $ 10.4 billion receipt will increase by $ 22.3 billion include the add tax revenue virtually all of this expenditure increase represent the mandatory cost of our defense effort $ 3 billion increase interest almost $ 1 billion or mandatory payment under law pass by congress such as those provide in the social security act that you pass in 1967 and to medicare and medicaid beneficiary veteran and farmer of about $ 4 1/2 billion and the additional $ 1 billion 600 million next year for the pay increase that you pass in military and civilian pay that make up the $ 10 billion that be add to the budget with few exception very few we be hold the fiscal 1969 budget to last year 's level outside of those mandatory and require increase

 if the congress enact the tax increase we will reduce the budget deficit by some $ 12 billion the war in vietnam be cost we about $ 25 billion and we be ask for about $ 12 billion in taxis and if we get that $ 12 billion tax bill we will reduce the deficit from about $ 20 billion in 1968 to about $ 8 billion in 1969

 now this be a tight budget it follow the reduction that i make in cooperation with the congress a reduction make after you have review every appropriation bill and reduce the appropriation by some $ 5 or $ 6 billion and expenditure by $ 1.5 billion we confer together and i recommend to the congress and you subsequently approve take 2 percent from payroll and 10 percent from controllable expenditure we therefore reduce appropriation almost $ 10 billion last session and expenditure over $ 4 billion now that be in the budget last year

 i ask the congress to recognize that there be certain select program that meet the nation 's most urgent need and they have increase we have insist that decrease in very desirable but less urgent program be make before we would approve any increase so i ask the congress tonight

 --to hold its appropriation to the budget request and

 --to act responsibly early this year by enact the tax surcharge which for the average american individual amount to about a penny out of each dollar 's income

 this tax increase would yield about half of the $ 23 billion per year that we return to the people in the tax reduction bill of 1964 and 1965

 this must be a temporary measure which expire in less than 2 year congress can repeal it soon if the need have pass but congress can never repeal inflation

 the leader of american business and the leader of american labor those who really have power over wage and price must act responsibly and in their nation 's interest by keep increase in line with productivity if our recognize leader do not do this they and those for whom they speak and all of we be go to suffer very serious consequence

 on january 1st i outline a program to reduce our balance of payment deficit sharply this year we will ask the congress to help carry out those part of the program which require legislation we must restore equilibrium to our balance of payment

 we must also strengthen the international monetary system we have assure the world that america 's full gold stock stand behind our commitment to maintain the price of gold at $ 35 an ounce we must back this commitment by legislate now to free our gold reserve

 americans travel more than any other people in history take $ 4 billion out of their country last year in travel cost we must try to reduce the travel deficit that we have of more than $ 2 billion we be hope that we can reduce it by $ 500 million without unduly penalize the travel of teacher student business people who have essential and necessary travel or people who have relative abroad whom they want to see even with this reduction of $ 500 million the american people will still be travel more overseas than they do in 1967 1966 or 1965 or any other year in their history

 if we act together as i hope we can i believe we can continue our economic expansion which have already break all past record and i hope that we can continue that expansion in the day ahead

 each of these question i have discuss with you tonight be a question of policy for our people therefore each of they should be and doubtless will be debate by candidate for public office this year

 i hope those debate will be mark by new proposal and by a seriousness that match the gravity of the question themselves

 these be not appropriate subject for narrow partisan oratory they go to the heart of what we americans be all about all of we democrats and republicans

 tonight i have speak of some of the goal i should like to see america reach many of they can be achieve this year other by the time we celebrate our nation 's 200th birthday the bicentennial of our independence

 several of these goal be go to be very hard to reach but the state of our union will be much strong 8 year from now on our 200th birthday if we resolve to reach these goal now they be more important much more important than the identity of the party or the president who will then be in office

 these goal be what the fighting and our alliance be really mean to protect

 can we achieve these goal

 of course we can if we will

 if ever there be a people who seek more than mere abundance it be our people

 if ever there be a nation that be capable of solve its problem it be this nation

 if ever there be a time to know the pride and the excitement and the hope of be an american it be this time

 so this my friend be the state of our union seek building test many time in this past year and always equal to the test

 thank you and good night





good evening my fellow americans
 tonight i want to speak to you of peace in vietnam and southeast asia
 no other question so preoccupie our people no other dream so absorb the 250 million human being who live in that part of the world no other goal motivate american policy in southeast asia
 for year representative of our government and other have travel the world seek to find a basis for peace talk
 since last september they have carry the offer that i make public at san antonio that offer be this
 that the united states would stop its bombardment of north vietnam when that would lead promptly to productive discussion and that we would assume that north vietnam would not take military advantage of our restraint
 hanoi denounce this offer both privately and publicly even while the search for peace be go on north vietnam rush their preparation for a savage assault on the people the government and the ally of south vietnam
 their attack during the tet holiday fail to achieve its principal objective
 it do not collapse the elect government of south vietnam or shatter its army as the communists have hope
 it do not produce a general uprising among the people of the city as they have predict
 the communists be unable to maintain control of any of the more than 30 city that they attack and they take very heavy casualty
 but they do compel the south vietnamese and their ally to move certain force from the countryside into the city
 they cause widespread disruption and suffering their attack and the battle that follow make refugee of half a million human being
 the communists may renew their attack any day
 they be it appear try to make 1968 the year of decision in south vietnam the year that bring if not final victory or defeat at least a turning point in the struggle this much be clear
 if they do mount another round of heavy attack they will not succeed in destroy the fighting power of south vietnam and its ally
 but tragically this be also clear many man on both side of the struggle will be lose a nation that have already suffer 20 year of warfare will suffer once again army on both side will take new casualty and the war will go on
 there be no need for this to be so
 there be no need to delay the talk that could bring an end to this long and this bloody war
 tonight i renew the offer i make last august to stop the bombardment of north vietnam we ask that talk begin promptly that they be serious talk on the substance of peace we assume that during those talk hanoi will not take advantage of our restraint
 we be prepared to move immediately toward peace through negotiation
 so tonight in the hope that this action will lead to early talk i be take the first step to deescalate the conflict we be reduce substantially reduce the present level of hostility
 and we be do so unilaterally and at once
 tonight i have order our aircraft and our naval vessel to make no attack on north vietnam except in the area north of the demilitarized zone where the continue enemy buildup directly threatens ally forward position and where the movement of their troop and supply be clearly related to that threat
 the area in which we be stop our attack include almost 90 percent of north vietnam 's population and most of its territory thus there will be no attack around the principal populate area or in the food produce area of north vietnam
 even this very limited bombing of the north could come to an early end if our restraint be match by restraint in hanoi but i can not in good conscience stop all bombing so long as to do so would immediately and directly endanger the life of our man and our ally whether a complete bombing halt become possible in the future will be determine by event
 our purpose in this action be to bring about a reduction in the level of violence that now exist
 it be to save the life of brave man and to save the life of innocent woman and child it be to permit the contend force to move close to a political settlement
 and tonight i call upon the united kingdom and i call upon the soviet union as cochairman of the geneva conferences and as permanent member of the united nations security council to do all they can to move from the unilateral act of deescalation that i have just announce toward genuine peace in southeast asia
 now as in the past the united states be ready to send its representative to any forum at any time to discuss the mean of bring this ugly war to an end
 i be designate one of our most distinguished americans ambassador averell harriman as my personal representative for such talk in addition i have ask ambassador llewellyn thompson who return from moscow for consultation to be available to join ambassador harriman at geneva or any other suitable place just as soon as hanoi agree to a conference
 i call upon president ho chi minh to respond positively and favorably to this new step toward peace
 but if peace do not come now through negotiation it will come when hanoi understand that our common resolve be unshakable and our common strength be invincible
 tonight we and the other allied nation be contribute 600,000 fight man to assist 700,000 south vietnamese troop in defend their little country
 our presence there have always rest on this basic belief the main burden of preserve their freedom must be carry out by they by the south vietnamese themselves
 we and our ally can only help to provide a shield behind which the people of south vietnam can survive and can grow and develop on their effort on their determination and resourcefulness the outcome will ultimately depend
 that small beleaguered nation have suffer terrible punishment for more than 20 year
 i pay tribute once again tonight to the great courage and endurance of its people south vietnam support armed force tonight of almost 700,000 man and i call your attention to the fact that this be the equivalent of more than 10 million in our own population its people maintain their firm determination to be free of domination by the north
 there have be substantial progress i think in build a durable government during these last 3 year the south vietnam of 1965 could not have survive the enemy 's tet offensive of 1968 the elect government of south vietnam survive that attack and be rapidly repair the devastation that it work
 the south vietnamese know that further effort be go to be require
 to expand their own armed force
 to move back into the countryside as quickly as possible
 to increase their taxis
 to select the very good man that they have for civil and military responsibility
 to achieve a new unity within their constitutional government and
 to include in the national effort all those group who wish to preserve south
 vietnam 's control over its own destiny last week president thieu order the mobilization of 135,000 additional south vietnamese he plan to reach as soon as possible a total military strength of more than 800,000 man
 to achieve this the government of south vietnam start the drafting of 19 year old on march 1st on may 1st the government will begin the drafting of 18 year old
 last month 10,000 man volunteer for military service that be two and a half time the number of volunteer during the same month last year since the middle of january more than 48,000 south vietnamese have join the armed force and nearly half of they volunteer to do so
 all man in the south vietnamese armed force have have their tour of duty extend for the duration of the war and reserve be now be call up for immediate active duty
 president thieu tell his people last week we must make great effort and accept more sacrifice because as i have say many time this be our country the existence of our nation be at stake and this be mainly a vietnamese responsibility
 he warn his people that a major national effort be require to root out corruption and incompetence at all level of government
 we applaud this evidence of determination on the part of south vietnam our first priority will be to support their effort
 we shall accelerate the reequipment of south vietnam 's armed force in order to meet the enemy 's increase firepower this will enable they progressively to undertake a large share of combat operation against the communist invader
 on many occasion i have tell the american people that we would send to vietnam those force that be require to accomplish our mission there so with that as our guide we have previously authorize a force level of approximately 525,000
 some week ago to help meet the enemy 's new offensive we send to vietnam about 11,000 additional marine and airborne troop they be deploy by air in 48 hour on an emergency basis but the artillery tank aircraft medical and other unit that be need to work with and to support these infantry troop in combat could not then accompany they by air on that short notice
 in order that these force may reach maximum combat effectiveness the joint chiefs of staff have recommend to i that we should prepare to send during the next 5 month support troop total approximately 13,500 man
 a portion of these man will be make available from our active force the balance will come from reserve component unit which will be call up for service
 the action that we have take since the beginning of the year
 to reequip the south vietnamese force
 to meet our responsibility in korea as well as our responsibility in vietnam
 to meet price increase and the cost of activate and deploy reserve force
 to replace helicopter and provide the other military supply we need all of these action be go to require additional expenditure
 the tentative estimate of those additional expenditure be $ 2.5 billion in this fiscal year and $ 2.6 billion in the next fiscal year
 these project increase in expenditure for our national security will bring into sharp focus the nation 's need for immediate action action to protect the prosperity of the american people and to protect the strength and the stability of our american dollar
 on many occasion i have point out that without a tax bill or decrease expenditure next year 's deficit would again be around $ 20 billion i have emphasize the need to set strict priority in our spending i have stress that failure to act and to act promptly and decisively would raise very strong doubt throughout the world about america 's willingness to keep its financial house in order
 yet congress have not act and tonight we face the sharp financial threat in the postwar era a threat to the dollar 's role as the keystone of international trade and finance in the world
 last week at the monetary conference in stockholm the major industrial country decide to take a big step toward create a new international monetary asset that will strengthen the international monetary system i be very proud of the very able work do by secretary fowler and chairman martin of the federal reserve board
 but to make this system work the united states just must bring its balance of payment to or very close to equilibrium we must have a responsible fiscal policy in this country the passage of a tax bill now together with expenditure control that the congress may desire and dictate be absolutely necessary to protect this nation 's security to continue our prosperity and to meet the need of our people
 what be at stake be 7 year of unparalleled prosperity in those 7 year the real income of the average american after taxis rise by almost 30 percent a gain as large as that of the entire precede 19 year
 so the step that we must take to convince the world be exactly the step we must take to sustain our own economic strength here at home in the past 8 month price and interest rate have rise because of our inaction
 we must therefore now do everything we can to move from debate to action from talk to voting there be i believe i hope there be in both houses of the congress a grow sense of urgency that this situation just must be act upon and must be correct
 my budget in january be we think a tight one it fully reflect our evaluation of most of the demanding need of this nation
 but in these budgetary matter the president do not decide alone the congress have the power and the duty to determine appropriation and taxis
 the congress be now consider our proposal and they be consider reduction in the budget that we submit
 as part of a program of fiscal restraint that include the tax surcharge i shall approve appropriate reduction in the january budget when and if congress so decide that that should be do
 one thing be unmistakably clear however our deficit just must be reduce failure to act could bring on condition that would strike hard at those people that all of we be try so hard to help
 these time call for prudence in this land of plenty i believe that we have the character to provide it and tonight i plead with the congress and with the people to act promptly to serve the national interest and thereby serve all of our people
 now let i give you my estimate of the chance for peace
 the peace that will one day stop the bloodshed in south vietnam
 that will permit all the vietnamese people to rebuild and develop their land
 that will permit we to turn more fully to our own task here at home
 i can not promise that the initiative that i have announce tonight will be completely successful in achieve peace any more than the 30 other that we have undertake and agree to in recent year
 but it be our fervent hope that north vietnam after year of fighting that have leave the issue unresolved will now cease its effort to achieve a military victory and will join with we in move toward the peace table
 and there may come a time when south vietnamese on both side be able to work out a way to settle their own difference by free political choice rather than by war
 as hanoi consider its course it should be in no doubt of our intention it must not miscalculate the pressure within our democracy in this election year
 we have no intention of widen this war
 but the united states will never accept a fake solution to this long and arduous struggle and call it peace
 no one can foretell the precise term of an eventual settlement
 our objective in south vietnam have never be the annihilation of the enemy it have be to bring about a recognition in hanoi that its objective take over the south by force could not be achieve
 we think that peace can be base on the geneva accords of 1954 under political condition that permit the south vietnamese all the south vietnamese to chart their course free of any outside domination or interference from we or from anyone else
 so tonight i reaffirm the pledge that we make at manila that we be prepared to withdraw our force from south vietnam as the other side withdraw its force to the north stop the infiltration and the level of violence thus subside
 our goal of peace and self determination in vietnam be directly relate to the future of all of southeast asia where much have happen to inspire confidence during the past 10 year we have do all that we know how to do to contribute and to help build that confidence
 a number of its nation have show what can be accomplish under condition of security since 1966 indonesia the fifth large nation in all the world with a population of more than 100 million people have have a government that be dedicate to peace with its neighbor and improve condition for its own people political and economic cooperation between nation have grow rapidly
 i think every american can take a great deal of pride in the role that we have play in bring this about in southeast asia we can rightly judge as responsible southeast asians themselves do that the progress of the past 3 year would have be far less likely if not completely impossible if america 's son and other have not make their stand in vietnam
 at johns hopkins university about 3 year ago i announce that the united states would take part in the great work of develop southeast asia include the mekong valley for all the people of that region our determination to help build a well land a well land for man on both side of the present conflict have not diminish in the least indeed the ravage of war i think have make it more urgent than ever
 so i repeat on behalf of the united states again tonight what i say at johns hopkins that north vietnam could take its place in this common effort just as soon as peace come
 over time a wide framework of peace and security in southeast asia may become possible the new cooperation of the nation of the area could be a foundation stone certainly friendship with the nation of such a southeast asia be what the united states seek and that be all that the united states seek
 one day my fellow citizen there will be peace in southeast asia
 it will come because the people of southeast asia want it those whose army be at war tonight and those who though threaten have thus far be spare
 peace will come because asians be willing to work for it and to sacrifice for it and to die by the thousand for it
 but let it never be forget peace will come also because america send her son to help secure it
 it have not be easy far from it during the past 4 year it have be my fate and my responsibility to be commander in chief i have live daily and nightly with the cost of this war i know the pain that it have inflict i know perhaps well than anyone the misgiving that it have arouse
 throughout this entire long period i have be sustain by a single principle that what we be do now in vietnam be vital not only to the security of southeast asia but it be vital to the security of every american
 surely we have treaty which we must respect surely we have commitment that we be go to keep resolution of the congress testify to the need to resist aggression in the world and in southeast asia
 but the heart of our involvement in south vietnam under three different president three separate administration have always be america 's own security
 and the large purpose of our involvement have always be to help the nation of southeast asia become independent and stand alone self sustain as member of a great world community at peace with themselves and at peace with all other
 with such an asia our country and the world will be far more secure than it be tonight
 i believe that a peaceful asia be far near to reality because of what america have do in vietnam i believe that the man who endure the danger of battle fight there for we tonight be help the entire world avoid far great conflict far wide war far more destruction than this one
 the peace that will bring they home someday will come tonight i have offer the first in what i hope will be a series of mutual move toward peace
 i pray that it will not be reject by the leader of north vietnam i pray that they will accept it as a means by which the sacrifice of their own people may be end and i ask your help and your support my fellow citizen for this effort to reach across the battlefield toward an early peace
 finally my fellow americans let i say this
 of those to whom much be give much be ask i can not say and no man could say that no more will be ask of we
 yet i believe that now no less than when the decade begin this generation of americans be willing to pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty
 since those word be speak by john f. kennedy the people of america have keep that compact with mankind 's noble cause
 and we shall continue to keep it
 yet i believe that we must always be mindful of this one thing whatever the trial and the test ahead the ultimate strength of our country and our cause will lie not in powerful weapon or infinite resource or boundless wealth but will lie in the unity of our people
 this i believe very deeply
 throughout my entire public career i have follow the personal philosophy that i be a free man an american a public servant and a member of my party in that order always and only
 for 37 year in the service of our nation first as a congressman as a senator and as vice president and now as your president i have put the unity of the people first i have put it ahead of any divisive partisanship
 and in these time as in time before it be true that a house divide against itself by the spirit of faction of party of region of religion of race be a house that can not stand
 there be division in the american house now there be divisiveness among we all tonight and hold the trust that be mine as president of all the people i can not disregard the peril to the progress of the american people and the hope and the prospect of peace for all people
 so i would ask all americans whatever their personal interest or concern to guard against divisiveness and all its ugly consequence
 fifty two month and 10 day ago in a moment of tragedy and trauma the duty of this office fall upon i i ask then for your help and god 's that we might continue america on its course bind up our wound heal our history move forward in new unity to clear the american agenda and to keep the american commitment for all of our people
 united we have keep that commitment united we have enlarge that commitment
 through all time to come i think america will be a strong nation a more just society and a land of great opportunity and fulfillment because of what we have all do together in these year of unparalleled achievement
 our reward will come in the life of freedom peace and hope that our child will enjoy through age ahead
 what we win when all of our people unite just must not now be lose in suspicion distrust selfishness and politic among any of our people
 believe this as i do i have conclude that i should not permit the presidency to become involved in the partisan division that be develop in this political year
 with america 's son in the field far away with america 's future under challenge right here at home with our hope and the world 's hope for peace in the balance every day i do not believe that i should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan cause or to any duty other than the awesome duty of this office the presidency of your country
 accordingly i shall not seek and i will not accept the nomination of my party for another term as your president
 but let man everywhere know however that a strong a confident and a vigilant america stand ready tonight to seek an honorable peace and stand ready tonight to defend an honored cause whatever the price whatever the burden whatever the sacrifice that duty may require
 thank you for listen good night and god bless all of you

mayor daley mr. wasilewski lady and gentleman

 some of you might have think from what i say last night that i have be take elocution lesson from lowell thomas one of my aide say this morning thing be really get confuse around washington mr. president

 i say how be that

 he say it look to i like you be go to the wrong convention in chicago

 i say well what you overlook be that it be april fool

 once again we be enter the period of national festivity which henry adams call the dance of democracy at its good that can be a time of debate and enlightenment at its bad it can be a period of frenzy but always it be a time when emotion threaten to substitute for reason yet the basic hope of a democracy be that somehow amid all the frenzy and all the emotion in the end reason will prevail reason just must prevail if democracy itself be to survive

 as i say last evening there be very deep and very emotional division in this land that we love today domestic division division over the war in vietnam with all of my heart i just wish this be not so my entire career in public life some 37 year of it have be devote to the art of find an area of agreement because generally speak i have observe that there be so many more thing to unite we americans than there be to divide we

 but somehow or other we have a facility sometimes of emphasize the division and the thing that divide we instead of discuss the thing that unite we sometimes i have be call a seeker of consensus"--more often that have be criticism of my action instead of praise of they but i have never deny it because to heal and to build support to hold people together be something i think be worthy and i believe it be a noble task it be certainly a challenge for all of we in this land and this world where there be restlessness and uncertainty and danger in my region of the country where i have spend my life where brother be once divide against brother my heritage have burn this lesson and it have burn it deep in my memory

 yet along the way i learn somewhere that no leader can pursue public tranquillity as his first and only goal for a president to buy public popularity at the sacrifice of his well judgment be too dear a price to pay this nation can not afford such a price and this nation can not long afford such a leader

 so the thing that divide our country this morning will be discuss throughout the land i be certain that the very great majority of informed americans will act as they have always act to do what be good for their country and what serve the national interest

 but the real problem of inform the people be still with we i think i can speak with some authority about the problem of communication i understand far well than some of my severe and perhaps intolerant critic would admit my own shortcoming as a communicator

 how do a public leader find just the right word or the right way to say no more or no less than he mean to say bear in mind that anything he say may topple government and may involve the life of innocent man

 how do that leader speak the right phrase in the right way under the right condition to suit the accuracy and contingency of the moment when he be discuss question of policy so that he do not stir a thousand misinterpretation and leave the wrong connotation or impression

 how do he reach the immediate audience and how do he communicate with the million of other who be out there listen from afar

 the president who must call his people and summon they to meet their responsibility as citizen in a hard and an endure war often ponder these question and search for the right course

 you man and woman who be master of the broadcast medium surely must know what i be talk about it be a long time ago when a president once say the printing press be the most powerful weapon with which man have ever arm himself in our age the electronic medium have add immeasurably to man 's power you have within your hand the mean to make our nation as intimate and as inform as a new england town meeting

 yet the use of broadcasting have not clear away all of the problem that we still have of communication in some way i think sometimes it have complicate they because it tend to put the leader in a time capsule it require he often to abbreviate what he have to say too often it may catch a random phrase from his rather lengthy discourse and project it as the whole story

 how many man i wonder mayor daley in public life have watch themselves on a tv newscast and then be tempt to exclaim can that really be i

 well there be no deny it you of the broadcast industry have enormous power in your hand you have the power to clarify and you have the power to confuse man in public life can not remotely rival your opportunity clay after day night after night hour after hour on the hour and the half hour sometimes you shape the nation 's dialogue

 the word that you choose hopefully always accurate and hopefully always just be the word that be carry out for all of the people to hear

 the commentary that you provide can give the real meaning to the issue of the day or it can distort they beyond all meaning by your standard of what be news you can cultivate wisdom or you can nurture misguided passion

 your commentary carry an add element of uncertainty unlike the print medium television write on the wind there be no accumulate record which the historian can examine later with a 20 20 vision of hindsight ask these question how fair be he tonight how impartial be he today how honest be he all along

 well i hope the national association of broadcasters with whom i have have a pleasant association for many year will point the way to all of we in develop this kind of a record because history be go to be ask very hard question about our time and the period through which we be pass

 i think that we all owe it to history to complete the record

 but i do not come here this morning to sermonize in matter of fairness and judgment no law or no set of regulation and no word of mine can improve you or dictate your daily responsibility

 all i mean to do and what i be try to do be to remind you where there be great power there must also be great responsibility this be true for broadcaster just as it be true for president and seeker for the presidency

 what we say and what we do now will shape the kind of a world that we pass along to our child and our grandchild i keep this thought constantly in my mind during the long day and the somewhat long night when crisis come at home and abroad

 i take a little of your prime time last night i would not have do that except for a very prime purpose

 i report on the prospect for peace in vietnam i announce that the united states be take a very important unilateral act of de escalation which could and i fervently pray will lead to mutual move to reduce the level of violence and to deescalate the war

 as i sit in my office last evening wait to speak i think of the many time each week when television bring the war into the american home

 no one can say exactly what effect those vivid scene have on american opinion historian must only guess at the effect that television would have have during early conflict on the future of this nation

 --during the korean war for example at that time when our force be push back there to pusan

 --or world war ii the battle of the bulge or when our man be slug it out in europe or when most of our air force be shoot down that day in june 1942 off australia

 but last night television be be use to carry a different message it be a message of peace it occur to i that the medium may be somewhat well suit to convey the action of conflict than to dramatize the word that the leader use in try and hope to end the conflict

 certainly it be more dramatic to show policeman and rioter lock in combat than to show man try to cooperate with one another

 the face of hatred and of bigotry come through much more clearly no matter what its color the face of tolerance i seem to find be rarely newsworthy

 progress whether it be a man be train for a job or million be train or whether it be a child in head start learn to read or an old person of 72 in adult education or be care for in medicare rarely make the news although more than 20 million of they be affect by it

 perhaps this be because tolerance and progress be not dynamic event such as riot and conflict be event

 peace in the news sense be a condition war be an event

 part of your responsibility be simply to understand the consequence of that fact the consequence of your own act and part of that responsibility i think be to try as very good we all can to draw the attention of our people to the real business of society in our system find and secure peace in the world at home and abroad for all that you have do and that you be do and that you will do to this end i thank you and i commend you

 i pray that the message of peace that i try so hard to convey last night will be accept in good faith by the leader of north vietnam

 i pray that one time soon the evening news show will have not another battle in the scarred hill of vietnam but will show man enter a room to talk about peace

 that be the event that i think the american people be yearn and long to see

 president thieu of vietnam and his government be now engage in very urgent political and economic task which i refer to last night and which we regard as very constructive and hopeful we hope the government of south vietnam make great progress in the day ahead

 but some time in the week ahead immediately i hope president thieu will be in a position to accept my invitation to visit the united states so he can come here and see our people too and together we can strengthen and improve our plan to advance the day of peace

 i pray that you and that every american will take to heart my plea that we guard against divisiveness we have win too much we have come too far and we have open too many door of opportunity for these thing now to be lose in a divided country where brother be separate from brother for the time that be allot i i shall do everything in one man 's power to hasten the day when the world be at peace and americans of all race and all creed of all conviction can live together without fear or without suspicion or without distrust in unity and in common purpose

 united we be strong divide we be in great danger

 in speak as i do to the nation last night i be move by the very deep conviction that i entertain about the nature of the office that it be my present privilege to hold the office of the presidency be the only office in this land of all the people whatever may be the personal wish or preference of any man who hold it a president of all the people can afford no thought of self

 at no time and in no way and for no reason can a president allow the integrity or the responsibility or the freedom of the office ever to be compromise or dilute or destroy because when you destroy it you destroy yourself

 i hope and i pray that by not allow the presidency to be involve in division and deep partisanship i shall be able to pass on to my successor a strong office strong enough to guard and defend all the people against all the storm that the future may bring we

 you man and woman who have come here to this great progressive city of chicago lead by this dynamic and great public servant dick daley be yourself charge with a peculiar responsibility you be yourself trustee legally accept trustee and legally select trustee of a great institution on which the freedom of our land utterly depend

member of the congress members of the cabinet distinguished americans and guest
 on an april afternoon in the year 1966 i ask a distinguished group of citizen who be interested in human right to meet i in the cabinet room in the white house in their presence that afternoon i sign a message to the congress that message call for the enactment of the first effective federal law against discrimination in the sale and the rental of housing in the united states of america
 few in the nation and the record will show that very few in that room that afternoon believe that fair housing would in our time become the unchallenged law of this land
 and indeed this bill have have a long and stormy trip
 we do not get it in 1966
 we plead for it again in 1967 but the congress take no action that year
 we ask for it again this year
 and now at long last this afternoon its day have come
 i do not exaggerate when i say that the proud moment of my presidency have be time such as this when i have sign into law the promise of a century
 i shall never forget that it be more than 100 year ago when abraham lincoln issue the emancipation proclamation but it be a proclamation it be not a fact
 in the civil rights act of 1964 we affirm through law that man equal under god be also equal when they seek a job when they go to get a meal in a restaurant or when they seek lodge for the night in any state in the union
 now the negro family no long suffer the humiliation of be turn away because of their race
 in the civil rights act of 1965 we affirm through law for every citizen in this land the most basic right of democracy the right of a citizen to vote in an election in his country in the five states where the act have its great impact negro voter registration have already more than double
 now with this bill the voice of justice speak again
 it proclaim that fair housing for all all human being who live in this country be now a part of the american way of life
 we all know that the root of injustice run deep but violence can not redress a solitary wrong or remedy a single unfairness
 of course all america be outraged at the assassination of an outstanding negro leader who be at that meeting that afternoon in the white house in 1966 and america be also outraged at the looting and the burning that defile our democracy
 we just must put our shoulder together and put a stop to both the time be here action must be now
 so i would appeal to my fellow americans by say the only real road to progress for free people be through the process of law and that be the road that america will travel
 i urge the congress to enact the measure for social justice that i have recommend in some twenty message these message go to the congress in january and february of this year they break a precedent by be complete and deliver and read and print these measure provide more than $ 78 billion that i have urge the congress to enact for major domestic program for all americans in the fiscal 1969 budget
 this afternoon as we gather here in this historic room in the white house i think we can all take some heart that democracy 's work be be do in the civil rights act of 1968 america do move forward and the bell of freedom ring out a little louder
 we have come some of the way not near all of it there be much yet to do if the congress see fit to act upon these twenty message and some fifteen appropriation bill i assure you that what remain to be do will be recommend in ample time for you to do it after you have complete what be already before you
 thank you very much

secretary rusk your excellencies honor member of congress distinguished guest lady and gentleman
 this be a very reassuring and hopeful moment in the relation among nation
 we have come here today to the east room of the white house to sign a treaty which limit the spread of nuclear weapon
 more than 55 nation be here in washington this morning to commit their government to this treaty their representative be also sign today in moscow and in london we hope and expect that virtually all the nation will move in the week and month ahead to accept this treaty which be commend to the world by the overwhelming majority of the member of the united nations general assembly
 the treaty 's purpose be very simple
 to commit the nation of the world which do not now have nuclear weapon not to produce or receive they in the future
 to assure equally that such nation have the full peaceful benefit of the atom and
 to commit the nuclear power to move forward toward effective measure of arm control and disarmament it be just a year ago that chairman kosygin and i agree at glassboro that we would work intensively in the time ahead to try to achieve this result
 after nearly a quarter century of danger and fear reason and sanity have prevail to reduce the danger and to greatly lessen the fear thus all mankind be reassure
 as the moment be reassure so it be even more hopeful and heartening for this treaty be evidence that amid the tension the strife the struggle and the sorrow of these year man of many nation have not lose the way or have not lose the will toward peace the conclusion of this treaty encourage the hope that other step may be take toward a peaceful world
 it be for these reason and in this perspective that i have describe this treaty as the most important international agreement since the beginning of the nuclear age
 it enhance the security of all nation by significantly reduce the danger of nuclear war among nation
 it encourage the peaceful use of nuclear energy by assure safeguard against its destructive use
 but perhaps most significantly the signing of this treaty keep alive and keep active the impulse toward a safe world
 we be inclined to neglect and to overlook what that impulse have bring about in recent year these have be fruitful time for the quiet work of diplomacy after long season of patient and painstaking negotiation we have conclude just within the past 5 year
 the limited test ban treaty
 the outer space treaty and
 the treaty create a nuclear free zone in latin america
 the march of mankind be toward the summit not the chasm we must not we shall not allow that march to be interrupt
 this treaty like the treaty it follow be not the work as secretary rusk say of any one particular nation it be the accomplishment of nation which seek to exercise their responsibility for maintain peace and maintain a stable world order it be my hope and the common will of mankind that all nation will agree that this treaty afford they some add protection we hope they will accept the treaty and thereby contribute far to international peace and security
 as one of the nation have nuclear weapon the united states all through these year have bear an awesome responsibility this treaty increase that rest for we have pledge that we shall use our weapon only in conformity with the charter of the united nations
 furthermore we have make clear to united nations security council what would like to repeat today if a state have accept this treaty do not have weapon and be a victim of aggression or be subject to a threat of aggression involve nuclear weapon the united states shall prepare to ask immediate security council action to provide assistance in accordance with the charter
 in welcome the treaty that prevent the spread of nuclear weapon i should like to repeat the united states commitment to honor all our obligation under exist treaty of mutual security such agreement have add greatly we think to the security of our nation and the nation with which such agreement exist they have create a degree of stability in a sometimes unstable world
 this treaty be a very important security measure but it also lay an indispensable foundation
 for expand cooperation in the peaceful application of nuclear energy
 for additional measure to halt the nuclear arm race
 we will cooperate fully to bring the treaty safeguard into be we shall thus help provide the basis of confidence that be necessary for increase cooperation in the peaceful nuclear field after the treaty have come into force we will permit the international atomic energy agency to apply its safeguard to all nuclear activity in the united states exclude only those with direct national security significance thus the united states be not ask any country to accept any safeguard that we be not willing to accept ourselves
 as the treaty require we shall also engage in the full possible exchange of equipment material and scientific and technological information for the peaceful use of nuclear energy the need of the develop nation will be give especially particular attention
 we shall make readily available to the nonnuclear treaty partner the benefit of nuclear explosion for peaceful purpose and we shall do so without delay and under the treaty 's provision
 now at this moment of achievement and great hope i be gratified to be able to report and announce to the world a significant agreement an agreement that we have actively seek and work for since january 1964
 agreement have be reach between the government of the union of soviet socialist republics and the united states to enter in the near future into discussion on the limitation and the reduction of both offensive strategic nuclear weapon delivery system and system of defense against ballistic missile
 discussion of this most complex subject will not be easy we have no illusion that it will be i know the stubborn patient persistence that it have require to come this far we do not underestimate the difficulty that may lie ahead i know the fear the suspicion and the anxiety that we shall have to overcome but we do believe that the same spirit of accommodation that be reflect in the negotiation of the present treaty can bring we to a good and fruitful result
 man can still shape his destiny in the nuclear age and learn to live as brother
 toward that goal the day when the world move out of the night of war into the light of sanity and security i solemnly pledge the resource the resolve and the unrelenting effort of the people of the united states and their government

good evening my fellow americans

 i speak to you this evening about very important development in our search for peace in vietnam

 we have be engage in discussion with the north vietnamese in paris since last may the discussion begin after i announce on the evening of march 31st in a television speech to the nation that the united states in an effort to get talk start on a settlement of the vietnam war have stop the bombing of north vietnam in the area where 90 percent of the people live

 when our representative ambassador harriman and ambassador vance be send to paris they be instruct to insist throughout the discussion that the legitimate elect government of south vietnam must take its place in any serious negotiation affect the future of south vietnam

 therefore our ambassadors harriman and vance make it abundantly clear to the representative of north vietnam in the beginning that as i have indicate on the evening of march 31st we would stop the bombing of north vietnamese territory entirely when that would lead to prompt and productive talk mean by that talk in which the government of vietnam be free to participate

 our ambassador also stress that we could not stop the bombing so long as by do so we would endanger the life and the safety of our troop

 for a good many week there be no movement in the talk at all the talk appear to really be deadlocke

 then a few week ago they enter a new and a very much more hopeful phase

 as we move ahead i conduct a series of very intensive discussion with our ally and with the senior military and diplomatic officer of the united states government on the prospect for peace the president also brief our congressional leader and all of the presidential candidate

 last sunday evening and throughout monday we begin to get confirmation of the essential understanding that we have be seek with the north vietnamese on the critical issue between we for some time i spend most of all day tuesday review every single detail of this matter with our field commander general abrams whom i have order home and who arrive here at the white house at 2:30 in the morning and go into immediate conference with the president and the appropriate member of his cabinet we receive general abrams judgment and we hear his recommendation at some length

 now as a result of all of these development i have now order that all air naval and artillery bombardment of north vietnam cease as of 8 a.m. washington time friday morning

 i have reach this decision on the basis of the development in the paris talk

 and i have reach it in the belief that this action can lead to progress toward a peaceful settlement of the vietnamese war

 i have already inform the three presidential candidate as well as the congressional leader of both the republican and the democratic parties of the reason that the government have make this decision

 this decision very closely conform to the statement that i have make in the past concern a bombing cessation

 it be on august 19th that the president say this administration do not intend to move far until it have good reason to believe that the other side intend seriously"—seriously—"to join we in deescalate the war and move seriously toward peace

 and then again on september 10th i say the bombing will not stop until we be confident that it will not lead to an increase in american casualty

 the joint chiefs of staff all military man have assure i and general abrams very firmly asserted to i on tuesday in that early 2:30 a.m. meeting that in their military judgment this action should be take now and this action would not result in any increase in american casualty

 a regular session of the paris talk be go to take place next wednesday november 6th at which the representative of the government of south vietnam be free to participate we be inform by the representative of the hanoi government that the representative of the national liberation front will also be present i emphasize that their attendance in no way involve recognition of the national liberation front in any form yet it conform to the statement that we have make many time over the year that the nlf would have no difficulty make its view know

 but what we now expect what we have a right to expect be prompt productive serious and intensive negotiation in an atmosphere that be conducive to progress

 we have reach the stage where productive talk can begin we have make clear to the other side that such talk can not continue if they take military advantage of they we can not have productive talk in an atmosphere where the city be be shell and where the demilitarized zone be be abuse

 i think i should caution you my fellow americans that arrangement of this kind be never foolproof for that matter even formal treaty be never foolproof as we have learn from our experience

 but in the light of the progress that have be make in recent week and after carefully consider and weigh the unanimous military and diplomatic advice and judgment render to the commander in chief i have finally decide to take this step now and to really determine the good faith of those who have assure we that progress will result when bombing cease and to try to ascertain if an early peace be possible the override consideration that govern we at this hour be the chance and the opportunity that we might have to save human life save human life on both side of the conflict therefore i have conclude that we should see if they be act in good faith

 we could be mislead and we be prepare for such a contingency we pray god it do not occur

 but it should be clear to all of we that the new phase of negotiation which open on november 6th do not repeat do not mean that a stable peace have yet come to southeast asia there may well be very hard fighting ahead certainly there be go to be some very hard negotiating because many difficult and critically important issue be still face these negotiator but i hope and i believe that with good will we can solve they we know that negotiation can move swiftly if the common intent of the negotiator be peace in the world

 the world should know that the american people bitterly remember the long agonizing korean negotiation of 1951 through 1953 and that our people will just not accept deliberate delay and prolong procrastination again

 well then how have it come about that now on november 1st we have agree to stop the bombardment of north vietnam

 i would have give all i possess if the condition have permit i to stop it month ago if there have just be any movement in the paris talk that would have justify i in say to you now it can be safely stop

 but i the president of the united states do not control the timing of the event in hanoi the decision in hanoi really determine when and whether it would be possible for we to stop the bombing

 we could not retract our insistence on the participation of the government of south vietnam in serious talk affect the future of their people the people of south vietnam for though we have ally with south vietnam for many year in this struggle we have never assume and we shall never demand the role of dictate the future of the people of south vietnam the very principle for which we be engage in south vietnam the principle of
 self determination require that the south vietnamese people themselves be permit to freely speak for themselves at the paris talk and that the south vietnamese delegation play a lead role in accordance with our agreement with president thieu at honolulu

 it be make just as clear to north vietnam that a total bombing halt must not risk the life of our man

 when i speak last march 31st i say that evening whether a complete bombing halt become possible in the future will be determine by event

 well i can not tell you tonight specifically in all detail why there have be progress in paris but i can tell you that a series of hopeful event have occur in south vietnam

 the government of south vietnam have grow steadily strong

 south vietnam 's armed forces have be substantially increase to the point where a million man be tonight under arm and the effectiveness of these man have steadily improve

 the superb performance of our own man under the brilliant leadership of general westmoreland and general abrams have produce truly remarkable result

 now perhaps some or all of these factor play a part in bring about progress in the talk and when at last progress do come i believe that my responsibility to the brave man our man who bear the burden of battle in south vietnam tonight and my duty to seek an honorable settlement of the war require i to recognize and require i to act without delay i have act tonight

 there have be many long day of wait for new step toward peace day that begin in hope only to end at night in disappointment constancy to our national purpose which be to seek the basis for a durable peace in southeast asia have sustain i in all of these hour when there seem to be no progress whatever in these talk

 but now that progress have come i know that your prayer be join with mine and with those of all humanity that the action i announce tonight will be a major step toward a firm and an honorable peace in southeast asia it can be

 so what be require of we in these new circumstance be exactly that steady determination and patience which have bring we to this more hopeful prospect

 what be require of we be a courage and a steadfastness and a perseverance here at home that will match that of our man who fight for we tonight in vietnam

 so i ask you not only for your prayer but for the courageous and understand support that americans always give their president and their leader in an hour of trial with that understanding and with that support we shall not fail

 seven month ago i say that i would not permit the presidency to become involved in the partisan division that be then develop in this political year accordingly on the night of march 31st i announce that i would not seek nor accept the nomination of my party for another term as president

 i have devote every resource of the presidency to the search for peace in southeast asia throughout the entire summer and fall i have keep all of the presidential candidate fully brief on development in paris as well as in vietnam i have make it abundantly clear that no one candidate would have the advantage over other either in information about those development or in advance notice of the policy the government intend to follow the chief diplomatic and military officer of this government all be instruct to follow the same course

 since that night on march 31st each of the candidate have have differ idea about the government 's policy but generally speak however throughout the campaign we have be able to present a united voice support our government and support our man in vietnam i hope and i believe that this can continue until january 20th of next year when a new president take office because in this critical hour we just simply can not afford more than
 one voice speak for our nation in the search for peace

 i do not know who will be inaugurate as the 37th president of the united states next january but i do know that i shall do all that i can in the next few month to try to lighten his burden as the contribution of the president who precede i have greatly lighten mine i shall do everything in my power to move we toward the peace that the new president as well as this president and i believe every other american so deeply and urgently desire

 thank you for listen good night and god bless all of you



 mr. speaker mr. president members of the congress and my fellow americans

 for the sixth and the last time i present to the congress my assessment of the state of the union

 i shall speak to you tonight about challenge and opportunity and about the commitment that all of we have make together that will if we carry they out give america our good chance to achieve the kind of great society that we all want every president live not only with what be but with what have be and what could be

 most of the great event in his presidency be part of a large sequence extend back through several year and extend back through several other administration

 urban unrest poverty pressure on welfare education of our people law enforcement and law and order the continue crisis in the middle east the conflict in vietnam the danger of nuclear war the great difficulty of deal with the communist power all have this much in common they and their cause the cause that give rise to they all of these have exist with we for many year several president have already seek to try to deal with they one or more president will try to resolve they or try to contain they in the year that be ahead of we

 but if the nation 's problem be continue so be this great nation 's asset

 --our economy

 --the democratic system

 --our sense of exploration symbolize most recently by the wonderful flight of the apollo 8 in which all americans take great pride

 --the good commonsense and sound judgment of the american people and

 --their essential love of justice

 we must not ignore our problem but neither should we ignore our strength those strength be available to sustain a president of either party to support his progressive effort both at home and overseas

 unfortunately the departure of an administration do not mean the end of the problem that this administration have face the effort to meet the problem must go on year after year if the momentum that we have all mount together in these past year be not to be lose

 although the struggle for progressive change be continuous there be time when a watershed be reach when there be if not really a break with the past at least the fulfillment of many of its old hope and a step forth into a new environment to seek new goal i think the past 5 year have be such a time

 we have finish a major part of the old agenda

 some of the law that we write have already in front of our eye take on the flesh of achievement

 medicare that we be unable to pass for so many year be now a part of american life

 vote right and the voting booth that we debate so long back in the riffle and the door to public service be open at last to all americans regardless of their color

 school and school child all over america tonight be receive federal assistance to go to good school

 preschool education head start be already here to stay and i think so be the federal program that tonight be keep more than a million and a half of the cream of our young people in the college and the university of this country

 part of the american earth not only in description on a map but in the reality of our shore our hill our park our forest and our mountain have be permanently set aside for the american public and for their benefit and there be more that will be set aside before this administration end

 five million americans have be train for job in new federal program

 i think it be most important that we all realize tonight that this nation be close to full employment with less unemployment than we have have at any time in almost 20 year that be not in theory that be in fact tonight the unemployment rate be down to 3.3 percent the number of job have grow more than 8 1/2 million in the last 5 year that be more than in all the precede 12 year

 these achievement complete the full cycle from idea to enactment and finally to a place in the life of citizen all across this country

 i wish it be possible to say that everything that this congress and the administration achieve during this period have already complete that cycle but a great deal of what we have commit need additional funding to become a tangible realization

 yet the very existence of these commitment these promise to the american people make by this congress and by the executive branch of the government be achievement in themselves and failure to carry through on our commitment would be a tragedy for this nation

 this much be certain no one man or group of man make these commitment alone congress and the executive branch with their check and balance reason together and finally write they into the law of the land they now have all the moral force that the american political system can summon when it act as one

 they express america 's common determination to achieve goal they imply action

 in most case you have already begin that action but it be not fully complete of course

 let i speak for a moment about these commitment i be go to speak in the language which the congress itself speak when it pass these measure i be go to quote from your word

 in 1966 congress declare that improve the quality of urban life be the most critical domestic problem face the united states two year later it affirm the historic goal of a decent home for every american family that be your language

 now to meet these commitment we must increase our support for the model city program where blueprint of change be already be prepare in more than 150 american city

 to achieve the goal of the housing act of 1968 that you have already pass we should begin this year more than 500,000 home for needy family in the come fiscal year fund be provide in the new budget to do just this this be almost 10 times--10 time the average rate of the past 10 year

 our city and our town be be press for fund to meet the need of their grow population so i believe an urban development bank should be create by the congress this bank could obtain resource through the issuance of taxable bond and it could then lend these resource at reduce rate to the community throughout the land for school hospital park and other public facility

 since we enact the social security act back in 1935 congress have recognize the necessity to make more adequate provision for aged person through maternal and child welfare and public health those be the word of the congress--"more adequate

 the time have come i think to make it more adequate i believe we should increase social security benefit and i be so recommend tonight

 i be suggest that there should be an overall increase in benefit of at least 13 percent those who receive only the minimum of $ 55 should get $ 80 a month

 our nation too be rightfully proud of our medical advance but we should remember that our country rank 15th among the nation of the world in its infant mortality rate

 i think we should assure decent medical care for every expectant mother and for their child during the first year of their life in the united states of america

 i think we should protect our child and their family from the cost of catastrophic illness

 as we pass on from medicine i think nothing be clear to the congress than the commitment that the congress make to end poverty congress express it well i think in 1964 when they say it be the policy of the united states to eliminate the paradox of poverty in the midst of plenty in this nation

 this be the rich nation in the world the antipoverty program have have many achievement it also have some failure but we must not cripple it after only 3 year of try to solve the human problem that have be with we and have be build up among we for generation

 i believe the congress this year will want to improve the administration of the poverty program by reorganize portion of it and transfer they to other agency i believe though it will want to continue until we have break the back of poverty the effort we be now make throughout this land

 i believe and i hope the next administration i believe they believe that the key to success in this effort be job it be work for people who want to work

 in the budget for fiscal 1970 i shall recommend a total of $ 3.5 billion for our job training program and that be five time as much as we spend in 1964 try to prepare americans where they can work to earn their own living

 the nation 's commitment in the field of civil right begin with the declaration of independence they be extend by the 13th 14th and 15th amendment they have be powerfully strengthen by the enactment of three far reach civil right law within the past 5 year that this congress in its wisdom pass

 on january 1 of this year the fair housing act of 1968 cover over 20 million american home and apartment the prohibition against racial discrimination in that act should be remember and it should be vigorously enforce throughout this land

 i believe we should also extend the vital provision of the voting rights act for another 5 year

 in the safe streets act of 1968 congress determine to assist state and local government in reduce the incidence of crime

 this year i be propose that the congress provide the full $ 300 million that the congress last year authorize to do just that

 i hope the congress will put the money where the authorization be

 i believe this be an essential contribution to justice and to public order in the united states i hope these grant can be make to the states and they can be use effectively to reduce the crime rate in this country

 but all of this be only a small part of the total effort that must be make i think chiefly by the local government throughout the nation if we expect to reduce the toll of crime that we all detest

 frankly as i leave the office of the presidency one of my great disappointment be our failure to secure passage of a licensing and registration act for firearm i think if we have pass that act it would have reduce the incidence of crime i believe that the congress should adopt such a law and i hope that it will at a not too distant date

 in order to meet our long stand commitment to make government as efficient as possible i believe that we should reorganize our postal system along the line of the kappel report

 i hope we can all agree that public service should never impose an unreasonable financial sacrifice on able man and woman who want to serve their country

 i believe that the recommendation of the commission on executive legislative and judicial salaries be generally sound later this week i shall submit a special message which i review with the leadership this evening contain a proposal that have be reduce and have modify the commission 's recommendation to some extent on the congressional salary

 for members of congress i will recommend the basic compensation not of the $ 50,000 unanimously recommend by the kappel commission and the other distinguished member but i shall reduce that $ 50,000 to $ 42,500 i will suggest that congress appropriate a very small additional allowance for official expense so that members will not be require to use their salary increase for essential official business

 i would have submit the commission 's recommendation except the advice that i receive from the leadership and you usually be consult about matter that affect the congress be that the congress would not accept the $ 50,000 recommendation and if i expect my recommendation to be seriously consider i should make substantial reduction that be the only reason i do not go along with the kappel report

 in 1967 1 recommend to the congress a fair and impartial random selection system for the draft i submit it again tonight for your most respectful consideration

 i know that all of we recognize that most of the thing we do to meet all of these commitment i talk about will cost money if we maintain the strong rate of growth that we have have in this country for the past 8 year i think we shall generate the resource that we need to meet these commitment

 we have already be able to increase our support for major social program although we have hear a lot about not be able to do anything on the home front because of vietnam but we have be able in the last 5 year to increase our commitment for such thing as health and education from $ 30 billion in 1964 to $ 68 billion in the come fiscal year that be more than double that be more than it have ever be increase in the 188 year of this republic notwithstanding vietnam

 we must continue to budget our resource and budget they responsibly in a way that will preserve our prosperity and will strengthen our dollar

 greater revenue and the reduced federal spending require by congress last year have change the budgetary picture dramatically since last january when we make our estimate at that time you will remember that we estimate we would have a deficit of $ 8 billion well i be glad to report to you tonight that the fiscal year end june 30 1969 this june we be go to have not a deficit but we be go to have a $ 2.4 billion surplus

 you will receive the budget tomorrow the budget for the next fiscal year that begin july 1 -which you will want to examine very carefully in the day ahead will provide a $ 3.4 billion surplus

 this budget anticipate the extension of the surtax that congress enact last year i have communicate with the president elect mr. nixon in connection with this policy of continue the surtax for the time be

 i want to tell you that both of we want to see it remove just as soon as circumstance will permit but the president elect have tell i that he have conclude that until his administration and this congress can examine the appropriation bill and each item in the budget and can ascertain that the fact justify permit the surtax to expire or to be reduce he mr. nixon will support my recommendation that the surtax be continue

 americans i believe be unite in the hope that the paris talk will bring an early peace to vietnam and if our hope for an early settlement of the war be realize then our military expenditure can be reduce and very substantial saving can be make to be use for other desirable purpose as the congress may determine

 in any event i think it be imperative that we do all that we responsibly can to resist inflation while maintain our prosperity i think all americans know that our prosperity be broad and it be deep and it have bring record profit the high in our history and record wage

 our gross national product have grow more in the last 5 year than any other period in our nation 's history our wage have be the high our profit have be the good this prosperity have enable million to escape the poverty that they would have otherwise have the last few year

 i think also you will be very glad to hear that the secretary of the treasury inform i tonight that in 1968 in our balance of payment we have achieve a surplus it appear that we have in fact do well this year than we have do in any year in this regard since the year 1957

 the quest for a durable peace i think have absorb every administration since the end of world war ii it have require we to seek a limitation of arm race not only among the superpower but among the small nation as well we have join in the test ban treaty of 1963 the outer space treaty of 1967 and the treaty against the spread of nuclear weapon in 1968

 this latter agreement the nonproliferation treaty be now pende in the senate and it have be pende there since last july in my opinion delay in ratify it be not go to be helpful to the cause of peace america take the lead in negotiate this treaty and america should now take step to have it approve at the early possible date

 until a way can be find to scale down the level of arm among the superpower mankind can not view the future without fear and great apprehension so i believe that we should resume the talk with the soviet union about limit offensive and defensive missile system i think they would already have be resume except for czechoslovakia and our election this year

 it be more than 20 year ago that we embark on a program of try to aid the develop nation we know then that we could not live in good conscience as a rich enclave on an earth that be seethe in misery

 during these year there have be great advance make under our program particularly against want and hunger although we be disappoint at the appropriation last year we think they be woefully inadequate this year i be ask for adequate fund for economic assistance in the hope that we can further peace throughout the world

 i think we must continue to support effort in regional cooperation among those effort that of western europe have a very special place in america 's concern

 the only course that be go to permit europe to play the great world role that its resource permit be to go forward to unity i think america remain ready to work with a united europe to work as a partner on the basis of equality

 for the future the quest for peace i believe require

 --that we maintain the liberal trade policy that have help we become the lead nation in world trade

 --that we strengthen the international monetary system as an instrument of world prosperity and

 --that we seek area of agreement with the soviet union where the interest of both nation and the interest of world peace be properly serve

 the strained relationship between we and the world 's lead communist power have not end especially in the light of the brutal invasion of czechoslovakia but totalitarianism be no less odious to we because we be able to reach some accommodation that reduce the danger of world catastrophe

 what we do we do in the interest of peace in the world we earnestly hope that time will bring a russia that be less afraid of diversity and individual freedom

 the quest for peace tonight continue in vietnam and in the paris talk

 i regret more than any of you know that it have not be possible to restore peace to south vietnam

 the prospect i think for peace be well today than at any time since north vietnam begin its invasion with its regular force more than 4 year ago

 the free nation of asia know what they be not sure of at that time that america care about their freedom and it also care about america 's own vital interest in asia and throughout the pacific

 the north vietnamese know that they can not achieve their aggressive purpose by force there may be hard fighting before a settlement be reach but i can assure you it will yield no victory to the communist cause

 i can not speak to you tonight about vietnam without pay a very personal tribute to the man who have carry the battle out there for all of we i have be honor to be their commander in chief the nation owe they its unstinting support while the battle continue and its endure gratitude when their service be do

 finally the quest for stable peace in the middle east go on in many capital tonight america fully support the unanimous resolution of the u.n. security council which point the way there must be a settlement of the armed hostility that exist in that region of the world today it be a threat not only to israel and to all the arab states but it be a threat to every one of we and to the entire world as well

 now my friend in congress i want to conclude with a few very personal word to you

 i reject and reject and then finally accept the congressional leadership 's invitation to come here to speak this farewell to you in person tonight

 i do that for two reason one be philosophical i want to give you my judgment as i see it on some of the issue before our nation as i view they before i leave

 the other be just pure sentimental most all of my life as a public official have be spend here in this building for 38 year since i work on that gallery as a doorkeeper in the house of representatives i have know these hall and i have know most of the man pretty well who walk they

 i know the question that you face i know the conflict that you endure i know the ideal that you seek to serve

 i leave here first to become vice president and then to become in a moment of tragedy the president of the united states

 my term of office have be mark by a series of challenge both at home and throughout the world

 in meet some of these challenge the nation have find a new confidence in meet other it know turbulence and doubt and fear and hate

 throughout this time i have be sustain by my faith in representative democracy a faith that i have learn here in this capitol building as an employee and as a congressman and as a senator

 i believe deeply in the ultimate purpose of this nation describe by the constitution temper by history embody in progressive law and give life by man and woman that have be elect to serve their fellow citizen

 now for five most demanding year in the white house i have be strengthen by the counsel and the cooperation of two great former president harry s. truman and dwight david eisenhower i have be guide by the memory of my pleasant and close association with the beloved john f. kennedy and with our great modern legislator speaker sam rayburn

 i have be assist by my friend every step of the way vice president hubert humphrey i be so grateful that i have be support daily by the loyalty of speaker mccormack and majority leader albert

 i have benefit from the wisdom of senator mike mansfield and i be sure that i have avoid many dangerous pitfall by the good commonsense counsel of the president pro tem of the senate senator richard brevard russell

 i have receive the most generous cooperation from the leader of the republican party in the congress of the united states senator dirksen and congressman gerald ford the minority leader

 no president should ask for more although i do upon occasion but few president have ever be bless with so much

 president elect nixon in the day ahead be go to need your understanding just as i do and he be entitle to have it i hope every member will remember that the burden he will bear as our president will be bear for all of we each of we should try not to increase these burden for the sake of narrow personal or partisan advantage

 now it be time to leave i hope it may be say a hundred year from now that by work together we help to make our country more just more just for all of its people as well as to insure and guarantee the blessing of liberty for all of our posterity

 that be what i hope but i believe that at least it will be say that we try



 mr. speaker mr. president members of the congress and my fellow americans

 for the sixth and the last time i present to the congress my assessment of the state of the union

 i shall speak to you tonight about challenge and opportunity and about the commitment that all of we have make together that will if we carry they out give america our good chance to achieve the kind of great society that we all want every president live not only with what be but with what have be and what could be

 most of the great event in his presidency be part of a large sequence extend back through several year and extend back through several other administration

 urban unrest poverty pressure on welfare education of our people law enforcement and law and order the continue crisis in the middle east the conflict in vietnam the danger of nuclear war the great difficulty of deal with the communist power all have this much in common they and their cause the cause that give rise to they all of these have exist with we for many year several president have already seek to try to deal with they one or more president will try to resolve they or try to contain they in the year that be ahead of we

 but if the nation 's problem be continue so be this great nation 's asset

 --our economy

 --the democratic system

 --our sense of exploration symbolize most recently by the wonderful flight of the apollo 8 in which all americans take great pride

 --the good commonsense and sound judgment of the american people and

 --their essential love of justice

 we must not ignore our problem but neither should we ignore our strength those strength be available to sustain a president of either party to support his progressive effort both at home and overseas

 unfortunately the departure of an administration do not mean the end of the problem that this administration have face the effort to meet the problem must go on year after year if the momentum that we have all mount together in these past year be not to be lose

 although the struggle for progressive change be continuous there be time when a watershed be reach when there be if not really a break with the past at least the fulfillment of many of its old hope and a step forth into a new environment to seek new goal i think the past 5 year have be such a time

 we have finish a major part of the old agenda

 some of the law that we write have already in front of our eye take on the flesh of achievement

 medicare that we be unable to pass for so many year be now a part of american life

 vote right and the voting booth that we debate so long back in the riffle and the door to public service be open at last to all americans regardless of their color

 school and school child all over america tonight be receive federal assistance to go to good school

 preschool education head start be already here to stay and i think so be the federal program that tonight be keep more than a million and a half of the cream of our young people in the college and the university of this country

 part of the american earth not only in description on a map but in the reality of our shore our hill our park our forest and our mountain have be permanently set aside for the american public and for their benefit and there be more that will be set aside before this administration end

 five million americans have be train for job in new federal program

 i think it be most important that we all realize tonight that this nation be close to full employment with less unemployment than we have have at any time in almost 20 year that be not in theory that be in fact tonight the unemployment rate be down to 3.3 percent the number of job have grow more than 8 1/2 million in the last 5 year that be more than in all the precede 12 year

 these achievement complete the full cycle from idea to enactment and finally to a place in the life of citizen all across this country

 i wish it be possible to say that everything that this congress and the administration achieve during this period have already complete that cycle but a great deal of what we have commit need additional funding to become a tangible realization

 yet the very existence of these commitment these promise to the american people make by this congress and by the executive branch of the government be achievement in themselves and failure to carry through on our commitment would be a tragedy for this nation

 this much be certain no one man or group of man make these commitment alone congress and the executive branch with their check and balance reason together and finally write they into the law of the land they now have all the moral force that the american political system can summon when it act as one

 they express america 's common determination to achieve goal they imply action

 in most case you have already begin that action but it be not fully complete of course

 let i speak for a moment about these commitment i be go to speak in the language which the congress itself speak when it pass these measure i be go to quote from your word

 in 1966 congress declare that improve the quality of urban life be the most critical domestic problem face the united states two year later it affirm the historic goal of a decent home for every american family that be your language

 now to meet these commitment we must increase our support for the model city program where blueprint of change be already be prepare in more than 150 american city

 to achieve the goal of the housing act of 1968 that you have already pass we should begin this year more than 500,000 home for needy family in the come fiscal year fund be provide in the new budget to do just this this be almost 10 times--10 time the average rate of the past 10 year

 our city and our town be be press for fund to meet the need of their grow population so i believe an urban development bank should be create by the congress this bank could obtain resource through the issuance of taxable bond and it could then lend these resource at reduce rate to the community throughout the land for school hospital park and other public facility

 since we enact the social security act back in 1935 congress have recognize the necessity to make more adequate provision for aged person through maternal and child welfare and public health those be the word of the congress--"more adequate

 the time have come i think to make it more adequate i believe we should increase social security benefit and i be so recommend tonight

 i be suggest that there should be an overall increase in benefit of at least 13 percent those who receive only the minimum of $ 55 should get $ 80 a month

 our nation too be rightfully proud of our medical advance but we should remember that our country rank 15th among the nation of the world in its infant mortality rate

 i think we should assure decent medical care for every expectant mother and for their child during the first year of their life in the united states of america

 i think we should protect our child and their family from the cost of catastrophic illness

 as we pass on from medicine i think nothing be clear to the congress than the commitment that the congress make to end poverty congress express it well i think in 1964 when they say it be the policy of the united states to eliminate the paradox of poverty in the midst of plenty in this nation

 this be the rich nation in the world the antipoverty program have have many achievement it also have some failure but we must not cripple it after only 3 year of try to solve the human problem that have be with we and have be build up among we for generation

 i believe the congress this year will want to improve the administration of the poverty program by reorganize portion of it and transfer they to other agency i believe though it will want to continue until we have break the back of poverty the effort we be now make throughout this land

 i believe and i hope the next administration i believe they believe that the key to success in this effort be job it be work for people who want to work

 in the budget for fiscal 1970 i shall recommend a total of $ 3.5 billion for our job training program and that be five time as much as we spend in 1964 try to prepare americans where they can work to earn their own living

 the nation 's commitment in the field of civil right begin with the declaration of independence they be extend by the 13th 14th and 15th amendment they have be powerfully strengthen by the enactment of three far reach civil right law within the past 5 year that this congress in its wisdom pass

 on january 1 of this year the fair housing act of 1968 cover over 20 million american home and apartment the prohibition against racial discrimination in that act should be remember and it should be vigorously enforce throughout this land

 i believe we should also extend the vital provision of the voting rights act for another 5 year

 in the safe streets act of 1968 congress determine to assist state and local government in reduce the incidence of crime

 this year i be propose that the congress provide the full $ 300 million that the congress last year authorize to do just that

 i hope the congress will put the money where the authorization be

 i believe this be an essential contribution to justice and to public order in the united states i hope these grant can be make to the states and they can be use effectively to reduce the crime rate in this country

 but all of this be only a small part of the total effort that must be make i think chiefly by the local government throughout the nation if we expect to reduce the toll of crime that we all detest

 frankly as i leave the office of the presidency one of my great disappointment be our failure to secure passage of a licensing and registration act for firearm i think if we have pass that act it would have reduce the incidence of crime i believe that the congress should adopt such a law and i hope that it will at a not too distant date

 in order to meet our long stand commitment to make government as efficient as possible i believe that we should reorganize our postal system along the line of the kappel report

 i hope we can all agree that public service should never impose an unreasonable financial sacrifice on able man and woman who want to serve their country

 i believe that the recommendation of the commission on executive legislative and judicial salaries be generally sound later this week i shall submit a special message which i review with the leadership this evening contain a proposal that have be reduce and have modify the commission 's recommendation to some extent on the congressional salary

 for members of congress i will recommend the basic compensation not of the $ 50,000 unanimously recommend by the kappel commission and the other distinguished member but i shall reduce that $ 50,000 to $ 42,500 i will suggest that congress appropriate a very small additional allowance for official expense so that members will not be require to use their salary increase for essential official business

 i would have submit the commission 's recommendation except the advice that i receive from the leadership and you usually be consult about matter that affect the congress be that the congress would not accept the $ 50,000 recommendation and if i expect my recommendation to be seriously consider i should make substantial reduction that be the only reason i do not go along with the kappel report

 in 1967 1 recommend to the congress a fair and impartial random selection system for the draft i submit it again tonight for your most respectful consideration

 i know that all of we recognize that most of the thing we do to meet all of these commitment i talk about will cost money if we maintain the strong rate of growth that we have have in this country for the past 8 year i think we shall generate the resource that we need to meet these commitment

 we have already be able to increase our support for major social program although we have hear a lot about not be able to do anything on the home front because of vietnam but we have be able in the last 5 year to increase our commitment for such thing as health and education from $ 30 billion in 1964 to $ 68 billion in the come fiscal year that be more than double that be more than it have ever be increase in the 188 year of this republic notwithstanding vietnam

 we must continue to budget our resource and budget they responsibly in a way that will preserve our prosperity and will strengthen our dollar

 greater revenue and the reduced federal spending require by congress last year have change the budgetary picture dramatically since last january when we make our estimate at that time you will remember that we estimate we would have a deficit of $ 8 billion well i be glad to report to you tonight that the fiscal year end june 30 1969 this june we be go to have not a deficit but we be go to have a $ 2.4 billion surplus

 you will receive the budget tomorrow the budget for the next fiscal year that begin july 1 -which you will want to examine very carefully in the day ahead will provide a $ 3.4 billion surplus

 this budget anticipate the extension of the surtax that congress enact last year i have communicate with the president elect mr. nixon in connection with this policy of continue the surtax for the time be

 i want to tell you that both of we want to see it remove just as soon as circumstance will permit but the president elect have tell i that he have conclude that until his administration and this congress can examine the appropriation bill and each item in the budget and can ascertain that the fact justify permit the surtax to expire or to be reduce he mr. nixon will support my recommendation that the surtax be continue

 americans i believe be unite in the hope that the paris talk will bring an early peace to vietnam and if our hope for an early settlement of the war be realize then our military expenditure can be reduce and very substantial saving can be make to be use for other desirable purpose as the congress may determine

 in any event i think it be imperative that we do all that we responsibly can to resist inflation while maintain our prosperity i think all americans know that our prosperity be broad and it be deep and it have bring record profit the high in our history and record wage

 our gross national product have grow more in the last 5 year than any other period in our nation 's history our wage have be the high our profit have be the good this prosperity have enable million to escape the poverty that they would have otherwise have the last few year

 i think also you will be very glad to hear that the secretary of the treasury inform i tonight that in 1968 in our balance of payment we have achieve a surplus it appear that we have in fact do well this year than we have do in any year in this regard since the year 1957

 i think we must continue to support effort in regional cooperation among those effort that of western europe have a very special place in america 's concern

 the only course that be go to permit europe to play the great world role that its resource permit be to go forward to unity i think america remain ready to work with a united europe to work as a partner on the basis of equality

 that be what i hope but i believe that at least it will be say that we try





senator dirksen mr. chief justice mr. vice president president johnson vice president humphrey my fellow americans and my fellow citizen of the world community
 i ask you to share with i today the majesty of this moment in the orderly transfer of power we celebrate the unity that keep we free
 each moment in history be a fleeting time precious and unique but some stand out as moment of beginning in which course be set that shape decade or century
 this can be such a moment
 force now be converge that make possible for the first time the hope that many of man 's deep aspiration can at last be realize the spiral pace of change allow we to contemplate within our own lifetime advance that once would have take century
 in throw wide the horizon of space we have discover new horizon on earth
 for the first time because the people of the world want peace and the leader of the world be afraid of war the time be on the side of peace
 eight year from now america will celebrate its 200th anniversary as a nation within the lifetime of most people now live mankind will celebrate that great new year which come only once in a thousand year the beginning of the third millennium
 what kind of nation we will be what kind of world we will live in whether we shape the future in the image of our hope be ours to determine by our action and our choice
 the great honor history can bestow be the title of peacemaker this honor now beckon america the chance to help lead the world at last out of the valley of turmoil and onto that high ground of peace that man have dream of since the dawn of civilization
 if we succeed generation to come will say of we now live that we master our moment that we help make the world safe for mankind
 this be our summon to greatness
 i believe the american people be ready to answer this call
 the second third of this century have be a time of proud achievement we have make enormous stride in science and industry and agriculture we have share our wealth more broadly than ever we have learn at last to manage a modern economy to assure its continued growth
 we have give freedom new reach and we have begin to make its promise real for black as well as for white
 we see the hope of tomorrow in the youth of today i know america 's youth i believe in they we can be proud that they be well educate more committed more passionately drive by conscience than any generation in our history
 no people have ever be so close to the achievement of a just and abundant society or so possessed of the will to achieve it because our strength be so great we can afford to appraise our weakness with candor and to approach they with hope
 stand in this same place a third of a century ago franklin delano roosevelt address a nation ravage by depression and grip in fear he could say in survey the nation 's trouble they concern thank god only material thing
 our crisis today be the reverse
 we have find ourselves rich in good but rag in spirit reach with magnificent precision for the moon but fall into raucous discord on earth
 we be catch in war want peace we be tear by division want unity we see around we empty life want fulfillment we see task that need do wait for hand to do they
 to a crisis of the spirit we need an answer of the spirit
 to find that answer we need only look within ourselves
 when we listen to the well angel of our nature we find that they celebrate the simple thing the basic thing such as goodness decency love kindness
 greatness come in simple trapping
 the simple thing be the one most need today if we be to surmount what divide we and cement what unite we
 to lower our voice would be a simple thing
 in these difficult year america have suffer from a fever of word from inflated rhetoric that promise more than it can deliver from angry rhetoric that fan discontent into hatred from bombastic rhetoric that posture instead of persuade
 we can not learn from one another until we stop shout at one another until we speak quietly enough so that our word can be hear as well as our voice
 for its part government will listen we will strive to listen in new way to the voice of quiet anguish the voice that speak without word the voice of the heart to the injured voice the anxious voice the voice that have despair of be hear
 those who have be leave out we will try to bring in
 those leave behind we will help to catch up
 for all of our people we will set as our goal the decent order that make progress possible and our life secure
 as we reach toward our hope our task be to build on what have go before not turn away from the old but turn toward the new
 in this past third of a century government have pass more law spend more money initiate more program than in all our previous history
 in pursue our goal of full employment well housing excellence in education in rebuild our city and improve our rural area in protect our environment and enhance the quality of life in all these and more we will and must press urgently forward
 we shall plan now for the day when our wealth can be transfer from the destruction of war abroad to the urgent need of our people at home
 the american dream do not come to those who fall asleep
 but we be approach the limit of what government alone can do
 our great need now be to reach beyond government and to enlist the legion of the concerned and the committed
 what have to be do have to be do by government and people together or it will not be do at all the lesson of past agony be that without the people we can do nothing with the people we can do everything
 to match the magnitude of our task we need the energy of our people enlist not only in grand enterprise but more importantly in those small splendid effort that make headline in the neighborhood newspaper instead of the national journal
 with these we can build a great cathedral of the spirit each of we raise it one stone at a time as he reach out to his neighbor help care do
 i do not offer a life of uninspire ease i do not call for a life of grim sacrifice i ask you to join in a high adventure one as rich as humanity itself and as exciting as the time we live in
 the essence of freedom be that each of we share in the shaping of his own destiny
 until he have be part of a cause large than himself no man be truly whole
 the way to fulfillment be in the use of our talent we achieve nobility in the spirit that inspire that use
 as we measure what can be do we shall promise only what we know we can produce but as we chart our goal we shall be lift by our dream
 no man can be fully free while his neighbor be not to go forward at all be to go forward together
 this mean black and white together as one nation not two the law have catch up with our conscience what remain be to give life to what be in the law to ensure at last that as all be bear equal in dignity before god all be bear equal in dignity before man
 as we learn to go forward together at home let we also seek to go forward together with all mankind
 let we take as our goal where peace be unknown make it welcome where peace be fragile make it strong where peace be temporary make it permanent
 after a period of confrontation we be enter an era of negotiation
 let all nation know that during this administration our line of communication will be open
 we seek an open world open to idea open to the exchange of good and people a world in which no people great or small will live in angry isolation
 we can not expect to make everyone our friend but we can try to make no one our enemy
 those who would be our adversary we invite to a peaceful competition not in conquer territory or extend dominion but in enrich the life of man
 as we explore the reach of space let we go to the new world together not as new world to be conquer but as a new adventure to be share
 with those who be willing to join let we cooperate to reduce the burden of arm to strengthen the structure of peace to lift up the poor and the hungry
 but to all those who would be tempt by weakness let we leave no doubt that we will be as strong as we need to be for as long as we need to be
 over the past twenty year since i first come to this capital as a freshman congressman i have visit most of the nation of the world
 i have come to know the leader of the world and the great force the hatred the fear that divide the world
 i know that peace do not come through wish for it that there be no substitute for day and even year of patient and prolonged diplomacy
 i also know the people of the world
 i have see the hunger of a homeless child the pain of a man wound in battle the grief of a mother who have lose her son i know these have no ideology no race
 i know america i know the heart of america be good
 i speak from my own heart and the heart of my country the deep concern we have for those who suffer and those who sorrow
 i have take an oath today in the presence of god and my countryman to uphold and defend the constitution of the united states to that oath i now add this sacred commitment i shall consecrate my office my energy and all the wisdom i can summon to the cause of peace among nation
 let this message be hear by strong and weak alike
 the peace we seek to win be not victory over any other people but the peace that come with healing in its wing with compassion for those who have suffer with understanding for those who have oppose we with the opportunity for all the people of this earth to choose their own destiny
 only a few short week ago we share the glory of man 's first sight of the world as god see it as a single sphere reflect light in the darkness
 as the apollo astronaut fly over the moon 's gray surface on christmas eve they speak to we of the beauty of earth and in that voice so clear across the lunar distance we hear they invoke god 's blessing on its goodness
 in that moment their view from the moon move poet archibald macleish to write
 to see the earth as it truly be small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it float be to see ourselves as rider on the earth together brother on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold brother who know now they be truly brother
 in that moment of surpass technological triumph man turn their thought toward home and humanity see in that far perspective that man 's destiny on earth be not divisible tell we that however far we reach into the cosmo our destiny lie not in the star but on earth itself in our own hand in our own heart
 we have endure a long night of the american spirit but as our eye catch the dimness of the first ray of dawn let we not curse the remain dark let we gather the light
 our destiny offer not the cup of despair but the chalice of opportunity so let we seize it not in fear but in gladness-- and rider on the earth together let we go forward firm in our faith steadfast in our purpose cautious of the danger but sustain by our confidence in the will of god and the promise of man

good evening my fellow americans

 tonight i want to talk to you on a subject of deep concern to all americans and to many people in all part of the world the war in vietnam

 i believe that one of the reason for the deep division about vietnam be that many americans have lose confidence in what their government have tell they about our policy the american people can not and should not be ask to support a policy which involve the override issue of war and peace unless they know the truth about that policy

 tonight therefore i would like to answer some of the question that i know be on the mind of many of you listen to i

 how and why do america get involve in vietnam in the first place

 how have this administration change the policy of the previous administration

 what have really happen in the negotiation in paris and on the battlefront in vietnam

 what choice do we have if we be to end the war

 what be the prospect for peace now let i begin by describe the situation i find when i be inaugurate on january 20

 the war have be go on for 4 year

 31,000 americans have be kill in action

 the training program for the south vietnamese be behind schedule

 540,000 americans be in vietnam with no plan to reduce the number

 no progress have be make at the negotiation in paris and the united states have not put forth a comprehensive peace proposal

 the war be cause deep division at home and criticism from many of our friend as well as our enemy abroad

 in view of these circumstance there be some who urge that i end the war at once by order the immediate withdrawal of all american force

 from a political standpoint this would have be a popular and easy course to follow after all we become involved in the war while my predecessor be in office i could blame the defeat which would be the result of my action on he and come out as the peacemaker some put it to i quite bluntly this be the only way to avoid allow johnson 's war to become nixon 's war

 but i have a great obligation than to think only of the year of my administration and of the next election i have to think of the effect of my decision on the next generation and on the future of peace and freedom in america and in the world

 let we all understand that the question before we be not whether some americans be for peace and some americans be against peace the question at issue be not whether johnson 's war become nixon 's war

 the great question be how can we win america 's peace

 well let we turn now to the fundamental issue why and how do the united states become involved in vietnam in the first place

 fifteen year ago north vietnam with the logistical support of communist china and the soviet union launch a campaign to impose a communist government on south vietnam by instigate and support a revolution

 in response to the request of the government of south vietnam president eisenhower send economic aid and military equipment to assist the people of south vietnam in their effort to prevent a communist takeover seven year ago president kennedy send 16,000 military personnel to vietnam as combat adviser four year ago president johnson send american combat force to south vietnam

 now many believe that president johnson 's decision to send american combat force to south vietnam be wrong and many other i among they have be strongly critical of the way the war have be conduct

 but the question face we today be now that we be in the war what be the good way to end it

 in january i could only conclude that the precipitate withdrawal of american force from vietnam would be a disaster not only for south vietnam but for the united states and for the cause of peace

 for the south vietnamese our precipitate withdrawal would inevitably allow the communists to repeat the massacre which follow their takeover in the north 15 year before

 they then murder more than 50,000 people and hundred of thousand more die in slave labor camp

 we see a prelude of what would happen in south vietnam when the communists enter the city of hue last year during their brief rule there there be a bloody reign of terror in which 3,000 civilian be club shoot to death and bury in mass grave

 with the sudden collapse of our support these atrocity of hue would become the nightmare of the entire nation and particularly for the million and a half catholic refugee who flee to south vietnam when the

 communists take over in the north for the united states this first defeat in our nation 's history would result in a collapse of confidence in american leadership not only in asia but throughout the world

 three american presidents have recognize the great stake involve in vietnam and understand what have to be do

 in 1963 president kennedy with his characteristic eloquence and clarity say we want to see a stable government there carry on a struggle to maintain its national independence

 we believe strongly in that we be not go to withdraw from that effort in my opinion for we to withdraw from that effort would mean a collapse not only of south viet nam but southeast asia so we be go to stay there

 president eisenhower and president johnson express the same conclusion during their term of office

 for the future of peace precipitate withdrawal would thus be a disaster of immense magnitude

 a nation can not remain great if it betray its ally and let down its friend

 our defeat and humiliation in south vietnam without question would promote recklessness in the council of those great power who have not yet abandon their goal of world conquest

 this would spark violence wherever our commitment help maintain the peace in the middle east in berlin eventually even in the western hemisphere

 ultimately this would cost more life it would not bring peace it would bring more war

 for these reason i reject the recommendation that i should end the war by immediately withdraw all of our force i choose instead to change american policy on both the negotiate front and battlefront

 in order to end a war fight on many front i initiate a pursuit for peace on many front

 in a television speech on may 14 in a speech before the united nations and on a number of other occasion i set forth our peace proposal in great detail

 we have offer the complete withdrawal of all outside force within one year

 we have propose a cease fire under international supervision

 we have offer free election under international supervision with the communists participate in the organization and conduct of the election as an organized political force and the saigon government have pledge to accept the result of the election

 we have not put forth our proposal on a take it or leave it basis we have indicate that we be willing to discuss the proposal that have be put forth by the other side we have declare that anything be negotiable except the fight of the people of south vietnam to determine their own future at the paris peace conference ambassador lodge have demonstrate our flexibility and good faith in 40 public meeting

 hanoi have refuse even to discuss our proposal they demand our unconditional acceptance of their term which be that we withdraw all american force immediately and unconditionally and that we overthrow the government of south vietnam as we leave

 we have not limit our peace initiative to public forum and public statement i recognize in january that a long and bitter war like this usually can not be settle in a public forum that be why in addition to the public statement and negotiation i have explore every possible private avenue that might lead to a settlement

 tonight i be take the unprecedented step of disclosing to you some of our other initiative for peace initiative we undertake privately and secretly because we think we thereby might open a door which publicly would be close

 i do not wait for my inauguration to begin my quest for peace

 soon after my election through an individual who be directly in contact on a personal basis with the leader of north vietnam i make two private offer for a rapid comprehensive settlement hanoi 's reply call in effect for our surrender before negotiation

 since the soviet union furnish most of the military equipment for north vietnam secretary of state rogers my assistant for national security affairs dr. kissinger ambassador lodge and i personally have meet on a number of occasion with representative of the soviet government to enlist their assistance in get meaningful negotiation start in addition we have have extend discussion direct toward that same end with representative of other government which have diplomatic relation with north vietnam none of these initiative have to date produce result

 in mid july i become convinced that it be necessary to make a major move to break the deadlock in the paris talk i speak directly in this office where i be now sit with an individual who have know ho chi minh president democratic republic of vietnam on a personal basis for 25 year through he i send a letter to ho chi minh i do this outside of the usual diplomatic channel with the hope that with the necessity of make statement for propaganda remove there might be constructive progress toward bring the war to an end let i read from that letter to you now

 dear mr. president

 i realize that it be difficult to communicate meaningfully across the gulf of four year of war but precisely because of this gulf i want to take this opportunity to reaffirm in all solemnity my desire to work for a just peace i deeply believe that the war in vietnam have go on too long and delay in bring it to an end can benefit no one least of all the people of vietnam

 the time have come to move forward at the conference table toward an early resolution of this tragic war you will find we forthcoming and open minded in a common effort to bring the blessing of peace to the brave people of vietnam let history record that at this critical juncture both side turn their face toward peace rather than toward conflict and war

 i receive ho chi minh 's reply on august 30 3 day before his death it simply reiterate the public position north vietnam have take at paris and flatly reject my initiative

 the full text of both letter be be release to the press

 in addition to the public meeting that i have refer to ambassador lodge have meet with vietnam 's chief negotiator in paris in 11 private session

 we have take other significant initiative which must remain secret to keep open some channel of communication which may still prove to be productive but the effect of all the public private and secret negotiation which have be undertake since the bombing halt a year ago and since this administration come into office on january 20 can be sum up in one sentence no progress whatever have be make except agreement on the shape of the bargaining table well now who be at fault

 it have become clear that the obstacle in negotiate an end to the war be not the president of the united states it be not the south vietnamese government

 the obstacle be the other side 's absolute refusal to show the least willingness to join we in seek a just peace and it will not do so while it be convince that all it have to do be to wait for our next concession and our next concession after that one until it get everything it want

 there can now be no long any question that progress in negotiation depend only on hanoi 's decide to negotiate to negotiate seriously

 i realize that this report on our effort on the diplomatic front be discourage to the american people but the american people be entitle to know the truth the bad news as well as the good news where the life of our young man be involve

 now let i turn however to a more encouraging report on another front

 at the time we launch our search for peace i recognize we might not succeed in bring an end to the war through negotiation i therefore put into effect another plan to bring peace a plan which will bring the war to an end regardless of what happen on the negotiate front

 it be in line with a major shift in u.s. foreign policy which i describe in my press conference at guam on july 25 let i briefly explain what have be describe as the nixon doctrine a policy which not only will help end the war in vietnam but which be an essential element of our program to prevent future vietnams

 we americans be a do it yourself people we be an impatient people instead of teach someone else to do a job we like to do it ourselves and this trait have be carry over into our foreign policy

 in korea and again in vietnam the united states furnish most of the money most of the arm and most of the man to help the people of those country defend their freedom against communist aggression

 before any american troop be commit to vietnam a leader of another asian country express this opinion to i when i be travel in asia as a private citizen he say when you be try to assist another nation defend its freedom u.s. policy should be to help they fight the war but not to fight the war for they

 well in accordance with this wise counsel i lay down in guam three principle as guideline for future american policy toward asia

 first the united states will keep all of its treaty commitment

 second we shall provide a shield if a nuclear power threaten the freedom of a nation ally with we or of a nation whose survival we consider vital to our security

 third in case involve other type of aggression we shall furnish military and economic assistance when request in accordance with our treaty commitment but we shall look to the nation directly threaten to assume the primary responsibility of provide the manpower for its defense

 after i announce this policy i find that the leader of the philippines thailand vietnam south korea and other nation which might be threaten by communist aggression welcome this new direction in american foreign policy

 the defense of freedom be everybody 's business not just america 's business and it be particularly the responsibility of the people whose freedom be threaten in the previous administration we americanize the war in vietnam in this administration we be vietnamize the search for peace

 the policy of the previous administration not only result in our assume the primary responsibility for fight the war but even more significantly do not adequately stress the goal of strengthen the south vietnamese so that they could defend themselves when we leave

 the vietnamization plan be launch follow secretary laird 's visit to vietnam in march under the plan i order first a substantial increase in the training and equipment of south vietnamese force

 in july on my visit to vietnam i change general abrams order so that they be consistent with the objective of our new policy under the new order the primary mission of our troop be to enable the south vietnamese force to assume the full responsibility for the security of south vietnam

 our air operation have be reduce by over 20 percent

 and now we have begin to see the result of this long overdue change in american policy in vietnam

 after 5 year of americans go into vietnam we be finally bring american man home by december 15 over 60,000 man will have be withdraw from south vietnam include 20 percent of all of our combat force

 the south vietnamese have continue to gain in strength as a result they have be able to take over combat responsibility from our american troop

 two other significant development have occur since this administration take office

 enemy infiltration infiltration which be essential if they be to launch a major attack over the last 3 month be less than 20 percent of what it be over the same period last year

 most important united states casualty have decline during the last 2 month to the low point in 3 year

 let i now turn to our program for the future

 we have adopt a plan which we have work out in cooperation with the south vietnamese for the complete withdrawal of all u.s. combat ground force and their replacement by south vietnamese force on an orderly schedule timetable this withdrawal will be make from strength and not from weakness as south vietnamese force become strong the rate of american withdrawal can become great

 i have not and do not intend to announce the timetable for our program and there be obvious reason for this decision which i be sure you will understand as i have indicate on several occasion the rate of withdrawal will depend on development on three front

 one of these be the progress which can be or might be make in the paris talk an announcement of a fix timetable for our withdrawal would completely remove any incentive for the enemy to negotiate an agreement they would simply wait until our force have withdraw and then move in

 the other two factor on which we will base our withdrawal decision be the level of enemy activity and the progress of the training program of the south vietnamese force and i be glad to be able to report tonight progress on both of these front have be great than we anticipate when we start the program in june for withdrawal as a result our timetable for withdrawal be more optimistic now than when we make our first estimate in june now this clearly demonstrate why it be not wise to be freeze in on a fixed timetable

 we must retain the flexibility to base each withdrawal decision on the situation as it be at that time rather than on estimate that be no long valid

 along with this optimistic estimate i must in all candor leave one note of caution

 if the level of enemy activity significantly increase we might have to adjust our timetable accordingly

 however i want the record to be completely clear on one point

 at the time of the bombing halt just a year ago there be some confusion as to whether there be an understanding on the part of the enemy that if we stop the bombing of north vietnam they would stop the shelling of city in south vietnam i want to be sure that there be no misunderstanding on the part of the enemy with regard to our withdrawal program

 we have note the reduced level of infiltration the reduction of our casualty and be base our withdrawal decision partially on those factor

 if the level of infiltration or our casualty increase while we be try to scale down the fighting it will be the result of a conscious decision by the enemy

 hanoi could make no great mistake than to assume that an increase in violence will be to its advantage if i conclude that increase enemy action jeopardize our remain force in vietnam i shall not hesitate to take strong and effective measure to deal with that situation

 this be not a threat this be a statement of policy which as commander in chief of our armed forces i be make in meet my responsibility for the protection of american fight man wherever they may be

 my fellow americans i be sure you can recognize from what i have say that we really only have two choice open to we if we want to end this war

 i can order an immediate precipitate withdrawal of all americans from vietnam without regard to the effect of that action

 or we can persist in our search for a just peace through a negotiate settlement if possible or through continue implementation of our plan for vietnamization if necessary a plan in which we will withdraw all of our force from vietnam on a schedule in accordance with our program as the south vietnamese become strong enough to defend their own freedom i have choose this second course it be not the easy way it be the right way

 it be a plan which will end the war and serve the cause of peace not just in vietnam but in the pacific and in the world

 in speak of the consequence of a precipitate withdrawal i mention that our ally would lose confidence in america

 far more dangerous we would lose confidence in ourselves oh the immediate reaction would be a sense of relief that our man be come home but as we see the consequence of what we have do inevitable remorse and divisive recrimination would scar our spirit as a people

 we have face other crisis in our history and have become strong by reject the easy way out and take the right way in meet our challenge our greatness as a nation have be our capacity to do what have to be do when we know our course be right

 i recognize that some of my fellow citizen disagree with the plan for peace i have choose honest and patriotic americans have reach different conclusion as to how peace should be achieve

 in san francisco a few week ago i see demonstrator carry sign read lose in vietnam bring the boy home

 well one of the strength of our free society be that any american have a right to reach that conclusion and to advocate that point of view but as president of the united states i would be untrue to my oath of office if i allow the policy of this nation to be dictate by the minority who hold that point of view and who try to impose it on the nation by mount demonstration in the street

 for almost 200 year the policy of this nation have be make under our constitution by those leader in the congress and the white house elect by all of the people if a vocal minority however fervent its cause prevail over reason and the will of the majority this nation have no future as a free society

 and now i would like to address a word if i may to the young people of this nation who be particularly concern and i understand why they be concern about this war

 i respect your idealism

 i share your concern for peace i want peace as much as you do there be powerful personal reason i want to end this war this week i will have to sign 83 letter to mother father wife and love one of man who have give their life for america in vietnam it be very little satisfaction to i that this be only one third as many letter as i sign the first week in office there be nothing i want more than to see the day come when i do not have to write any of those letter

 i want to end the war to save the life of those brave young man in vietnam

 but i want to end it in a way which will increase the chance that their young brother and their son will not have to fight in some future vietnam someplace in the world

 and i want to end the war for another reason i want to end it so that the energy and dedication of you our young people now too often direct into bitter hatred against those responsible for the war can be turn to the great challenge of peace a well life for all americans a well life for all people on this earth

 i have choose a plan for peace i believe it will succeed

 if it do succeed what the critic say now will not matter if it do not succeed anything i say then will not matter

 i know it may not be fashionable to speak of patriotism or national destiny these day but i feel it be appropriate to do so on this occasion

 two hundred year ago this nation be weak and poor but even then america be the hope of million in the world today we have become the strong and rich nation in the world and the wheel of destiny have turn so that any hope the world have for the survival of peace and freedom will be determine by whether the american people have the moral stamina and the courage to meet the challenge of free world leadership

 let historian not record that when america be the most powerful nation in the world we pass on the other side of the road and allow the last hope for peace and freedom of million of people to be suffocate by the force of totalitarianism

 and so tonight to you the great silent majority of my fellow americans i ask for your support

 i pledge in my campaign for the presidency to end the war in a way that we could win the peace i have initiate a plan of action which will enable i to keep that pledge

 the more support i can have from the american people the soon that pledge can be redeem for the more divided we be at home the less likely the enemy be to negotiate at paris

 let we be unite for peace let we also be unite against defeat because let we understand north vietnam can not defeat or humiliate the united states only americans can do that

 fifty year ago in this room and at this very desk president woodrow wilson speak word which catch the imagination of a war weary world he say this be the war to end war his dream for peace after world war i be shatter on the hard reality of great power politic and woodrow wilson die a broken man

 tonight i do not tell you that the war in vietnam be the war to end war but i do say this i have initiate a plan which will end this war in a way that will bring we close to that great goal to which woodrow wilson and every american president in our history have be dedicate the goal of a just and last peace

 as president i hold the responsibility for choose the good path to that goal and then lead the nation along it

 i pledge to you tonight that i shall meet this responsibility with all of the strength and wisdom i can command in accordance with your hope mindful of your concern sustain by your prayer

 thank you and goodnight

mr. speaker mr. president my colleague in the congress our distinguished guest and my fellow americans

 to address a joint session of the congress in this great chamber in which i be once privileged to serve be an honor for which i be deeply grateful

 the state of the union address be traditionally an occasion for a lengthy and detailed account by the president of what he have accomplish in the past what he want the congress to do in the future and in an election year to lay the basis for the political issue which might be decisive in the fall

 occasionally there come a time when profound and far reach event command a break with tradition this be such a time

 i say this not only because 1970 mark the beginning of a new decade in which america will celebrate its 200th birthday i say it because new knowledge and hard experience argue persuasively that both our program and our institution in america need to be reform

 the moment have arrive to harness the vast energy and abundance of this land to the creation of a new american experience an experience rich and deep and more truly a reflection of the goodness and grace of the human spirit

 the 70 will be a time of new beginning a time of explore both on the earth and in the heaven a time of discovery but the time have also come for emphasis on develop well way of manage what we have and of complete what man 's genius have begin but leave unfinished

 our land this land that be our together be a great and a good land it be also an unfinished land and the challenge of perfect it be the summon of the 70

 it be in that spirit that i address myself to those great issue face our nation which be above partisanship

 when we speak of america 's priority the first priority must always be peace for america and the world

 the major immediate goal of our foreign policy be to bring an end to the war in vietnam in a way that our generation will be remember not so much as the generation that suffer in war but more for the fact that we have the courage and character to win the kind of a just peace that the next generation be able to keep

 we be make progress toward that goal

 the prospect for peace be far great today than they be a year ago

 a major part of the credit for this development go to the member of this congress who despite their difference on the conduct of the war have overwhelmingly indicate their support of a just peace by this action you have completely demolish the enemy 's hope that they can gain in washington the victory our fight man have deny they in vietnam

 no goal could be great than to make the next generation the first in this century in which america be at peace with every nation in the world

 i shall discuss in detail the new concept and program design to achieve this goal in a separate report on foreign policy which i shall submit to the congress at a later date

 today let i describe the direction of our new policy

 we have base our policy on an evaluation of the world as it be not as it be 25 year ago at the conclusion of world war ii many of the policy which be necessary and fight then be obsolete today

 then because of america 's overwhelming military and economic strength because of the weakness of other major free world power and the inability of score of newly independent nation to defend or even govern themselves america have to assume the major burden for the defense of freedom in the world

 in two war first in korea and now in vietnam we furnish most of the money most of the arm most of the man to help other nation defend their freedom

 today the great industrial nation of europe as well as japan have regain their economic strength and the nation of latin america and many of the nation who acquire their freedom from colonialism after world war ii in asia and africa have a new sense of pride and dignity and a determination to assume the responsibility for their own defense

 that be the basis of the doctrine i announce at guam neither the defense nor the development of other nation can be exclusively or primarily an american undertaking

 the nation of each part of the world should assume the primary responsibility for their own well being and they themselves should determine the term of that well being

 we shall be faithful to our treaty commitment but we shall reduce our involvement and our presence in other nation affair

 to insist that other nation play a role be not a retreat from responsibility it be a sharing of responsibility

 the result of this new policy have be not to weaken our alliance but to give they new life new strength a new sense of common purpose

 relation with our european ally be once again strong and healthy base on mutual consultation and mutual responsibility

 we have initiate a new approach to latin america in which we deal with those nation as partner rather than patron

 the new partnership concept have be welcome in asia we have develop an historic new basis for japanese american friendship and cooperation which be the linchpin for peace in the pacific

 if we be to have peace in the last third of the century a major factor will be the development of a new relationship between the united states and the soviet union

 i would not underestimate our difference but we be move with precision and purpose from an era of confrontation to an era of negotiation

 our negotiation on strategic arm limitation and in other area will have far great chance for success if both side enter they motivate by mutual self interest rather than naive sentimentality

 it be with this same spirit that we have resume discussion with communist china in our talk at warsaw

 our concern in our relation with both these nation be to avoid a catastrophic collision and to build a solid basis for peaceful settlement of our difference

 i would be the last to suggest that the road to peace be not difficult and dangerous but i believe our new policy have contribute to the prospect that america may have the good chance since world war ii to enjoy a generation of uninterrupted peace and that chance will be enormously increase if we continue to have a relationship between congress and the executive in which despite difference in detail where the security of america and the peace of mankind be concern we act not as republicans not as democrats but as americans

 as we move into the decade of the 70 we have the great opportunity for progress at home of any people in world history

 our gross national product will increase by $ 500 billion in the next 10 year this increase alone be great than the entire growth of the american economy from 1790 to 1950

 the critical question be not whether we will grow but how we will use that growth

 the decade of the 60 be also a period of great growth economically but in that same 10 year period we witness the great growth of crime the great increase in inflation the great social unrest in america in 100 year never have a nation seem to have have more and enjoy it less

 at heart the issue be the effectiveness of government

 our have become as it continue to be and should remain a society of large expectation government help to generate these expectation it undertake to meet they yet increasingly it prove unable to do so

 as a people we have too many vision and too little vision

 now as we enter the 70 we should enter also a great age of reform of the institution of american government

 our purpose in this period should not be simply well management of the program of the past the time have come for a new quest a quest not for a great quantity of what we have but for a new quality of life in america

 a major part of the substance for an unprecedented advance in this nation 's approach to its problem and opportunity be contain in more than two score legislative proposal which i send to the congress last year and which still await enactment

 i will offer at least a dozen more major program in the course of this session

 at this point i do not intend to through a detailed listing of what i have propose or will propose but i would like to mention three area in which urgent priority demand that we move and move now

 first we can not delay long in accomplish a total reform of our welfare system when a system penalize work break up home robs recipient of dignity there be no alternative to abolish that system and adopt in its place the program of income support job training and work incentive which i recommend to the congress last year

 second the time have come to assess and reform all of our institution of government at the federal state and local level it be time for a new federalism in which after 190 year of power flow from the people and local and state government to washington d.c. it will begin to flow from washington back to the state and to the people of the united states

 third we must adopt reform which will expand the range of opportunity for all americans we can fulfill the american dream only when each person have a fair chance to fulfill his own dream this mean equal voting right equal employment opportunity and new opportunity for expand ownership because in order to be secure in their human right people need access to property right

 i could give similar example of the need for reform in our program for health education housing transportation as well as other critical area which directly affect the well being of million of americans

 the people of the united states should wait no long for these reform that would so deeply enhance the quality of their life

 when i speak of action which would be beneficial to the american people i can think of none more important than for the congress to join this administration in the battle to stop the rise in the cost of living

 now i realize it be tempting to blame someone else for inflation some blame business for raise price some blame union for ask for more wage

 but a review of the stark fiscal fact of the 1960 clearly demonstrate where the primary blame for rise price must be place

 in the decade of the 60 the federal government spend $ 57 billion more than it take in in taxis

 in that same decade the american people pay the bill for that deficit in price increase which raise the cost of live for the average family of four by $ 200 per month in america

 now million of americans be force to go into debt today because the federal government decide to go into debt yesterday we must balance our federal budget so that american family will have a well chance to balance their family budget

 only with the cooperation of the congress can we meet this high priority objective of responsible government we be on the right track


 we have a balanced budget in 1969 this administration cut more than $ 7 billion out of spend plan in order to produce a surplus in 1970 and in spite of the fact that congress reduce revenue by $ 3 billion i shall recommend a balanced budget for 1971

 but i can assure you that not only to present but to stay within a balanced budget require some very hard decision it mean reject spending program which would benefit some of the people when their net effect would result in price increase for all the people

 it be time to quit put good money into bad program otherwise we will end up with bad money and bad program

 i recognize the political popularity of spending program and particularly in an election year but unless we stop the rise in price the cost of live for million of american family will become unbearable and government 's ability to plan program for progress for the future will become impossible

 in refer to budget cut there be one area where i have order an increase rather than a cut and that be the request of those agency with the responsibility for law enforcement

 we have hear a great deal of overblown rhetoric during the 60 in which the word war have perhaps too often be use the war on poverty the war on misery the war on disease the war on hunger but if there be one area where the word war be appropriate it be in the fight against crime we must declare and win the war against the criminal element which increasingly threaten our city our home and our life

 we have a tragic example of this problem in the nation 's capital for whose safety the congress and the executive have the primary responsibility i doubt if many member of this congress who live more than a few block from here would dare leave their car in the capitol garage and walk home alone tonight

 last year this administration send to the congress 13 separate piece of legislation deal with organized crime pornography street crime narcotic crime in the district of columbia

 none of these bill have reach my desk for signature

 i be confident that the congress will act now to adopt the legislation i place before you last year we in the executive have do everything we can under exist law but new and strong weapon be need in that fight

 while it be true that state and local law enforcement agency be the cutting edge in the effort to eliminate street crime burglary murder my proposal to you have embody my belief that the federal government should play a great role in work in partnership with these agency
 that be why 1971 federal spending for local law enforcement will double that budget for 1970

 the primary responsibility for crime that affect individual be with local and state rather than with federal government but in the field of organized crime narcotic pornography the federal government have a special responsibility it should fulfill and we should make washington d.c. where we have the primary responsibility an example to the nation and the world of respect for law rather than lawlessness

 i now turn to a subject which next to our desire for peace may well become the major concern of the american people in the decade of the seventy

 in the next 10 year we shall increase our wealth by 50 percent the profound question be do this mean we will be 50 percent rich in a real sense 50 percent well off 50 percent happy

 or do it mean that in the year 1980 the president stand in this place will look back on a decade in which 70 percent of our people live in metropolitan area choke by traffic suffocate by smog poison by water deafen by noise and terrorize by crime

 these be not the great question that concern world leader at summit conference but people do not live at the summit they live in the foothill of everyday experience and it be time for all of we to concern ourselves with the way real people live in real life

 the great question of the seventy be shall we surrender to our surrounding or shall we make our peace with nature and begin to make reparation for the damage we have do to our air to our land and to our water

 restore nature to its natural state be a cause beyond party and beyond faction it have become a common cause of all the people of this country it be a cause of particular concern to young americans because they more than we will reap the grim consequence of our failure to act on program which be need now if we be to prevent disaster later

 clean air clean water open space these should once again be the birthright of every american if we act now they can be

 we still think of air as free but clean air be not free and neither be clean water the price tag on pollution control be high through our year of past carelessness we incur a debt to nature and now that debt be be call

 the program i shall propose to congress will be the most comprehensive and costly program in this field in america 's history

 it be not a program for just one year a year 's plan in this field be no plan at all this be a time to look ahead not a year but five year or 10 year whatever time be require to do the job

 i shall propose to this congress a $ 10 billion nationwide clean water program to put modern municipal waste treatment plant in every place in america where they be need to make our water clean again and do it now we have the industrial capacity if we begin now to build they all within five year this program will get they build within five year

 as our city and suburb relentlessly expand those priceless open space need for recreation area accessible to their people be swallow up often forever unless we preserve these space while they be still available we will have none to preserve therefore i shall propose new financing method for purchase open space and parkland now before they be lose to we

 the automobile be our bad polluter of the air adequate control require further advance in engine design and fuel composition we shall intensify our research set increasingly strict standard and strengthen enforcement procedure and we shall do it now

 we can no long afford to consider air and water common property free to be abuse by anyone without regard to the consequence instead we should begin now to treat they as scarce resource which we be no more free to contaminate than we be free to throw garbage into our neighbor 's yard

 this require comprehensive new regulation it also require that to the extent possible the price of good should be make to include the cost of produce and dispose of they without damage to the environment

 now i realize that the argument be often make that there be a fundamental contradiction between economic growth and the quality of life so that to have one we must forsake the other

 the answer be not to abandon growth but to redirect it for example we should turn toward end congestion and eliminate smog the same reservoir of inventive genius that create they in the first place

 continue vigorous economic growth provide we with the mean to enrich life itself and to enhance our planet as a place hospitable to man

 each individual must enlist in this fight if it be to be win

 it have be say that no matter how many national park and historical monument we buy and develop the truly significant environment for each of we be that in which we spend 80 percent of our time in our home in our place of work the street over which we travel

 street litter rundown parking strip and yard dilapidated fence break window smoking automobile dingy work place all should be the object of our fresh view

 we have be too tolerant of our surrounding and too willing to leave it to other to clean up our environment it be time for those who make massive demand on society to make some minimal demand on themselves each of we must resolve that each day he will leave his home his property the public place of the city or town a little clean a little well a little more pleasant for himself and those around he

 with the help of people we can do anything and without their help we can do nothing in this spirit together we can reclaim our land for our and generation to come

 between now and the year 5000 over 100 million child will be bear in the united states where they grow up and how will more than any one thing measure the quality of american life in these year ahead this should be a warning to we

 for the past 30 year our population have also be grow and shift the result be exemplified in the vast area of rural america empty out of people and of promise a third of our county lose population in the 60

 the violent and decay central city of our great metropolitan complex be the most conspicuous area of failure in american life today i propose that before these problem become insoluble the nation develop a national growth policy

 in the future government decision as to where to build highway locate airport acquire land or sell land should be make with a clear objective of aid a balanced growth for america

 in particular the federal government must be in a position to assist in the building of new city and the rebuilding of old one

 at the same time we will carry our concern with the quality of life in america to the farm as well as the suburb to the village as well as to the city what rural america need most be a new kind of assistance it need to be deal with not as a separate nation but as part of an overall growth policy for america we must create a new rural environment which will not only stem the migration to urban center but reverse it if we seize our growth as a challenge we can make the 1970 an historic period when by conscious choice we transform our land into what we want it to become

 america which have pioneer in the new abundance and in the new technology be call upon today to pioneer in meet the concern which have follow in their wake in turn the wonder of science to the service of man

 in the majesty of this great chamber we hear the echo of america 's history of debate that rock the union and those that repair it of the summon to war and the search for peace of the uniting of the people the building of a nation

 those echo of history remind we of our root and our strength

 they remind we also of that special genius of american democracy which at one critical turning point after another have lead we to spot the new road to the future and give we the wisdom and the courage to take it

 as i look down that new road which i have try to map out today i see a new america as we celebrate our 200th anniversary six year from now

 i see an america in which we have abolish hunger provide the mean for every family in the nation to obtain a minimum income make enormous progress in provide well housing fast transportation improved health and superior education

 i see an america in which we have check inflation and wage a win war against crime

 i see an america in which we have make great stride in stop the pollution of our air clean up our water open up our park continue to explore in space

 most important i see an america at peace with all the nation of the world

 this be not an impossible dream these goal be all within our reach

 in time past our forefather have the vision but not the mean to achieve such goal

 let it not be record that we be the first american generation that have the mean but not the vision to make this dream come true

 but let we above all recognize a fundamental truth we can be the well clothe well feed well house people in the world enjoy clean air clean water beautiful park but we could still be the unhappy people in the world without an indefinable spirit the lift of a driving dream which have make america from its beginning the hope of the world

 two hundred year ago this be a new nation of three million people weak militarily poor economically but america mean something to the world then which could not be measure in dollar something far more important than military might

 listen to president thomas jefferson in 1802 we act not for ourselves alone but for the whole human race

 we have a spiritual quality then which catch the imagination of million of people in the world

 today when we be the rich and strong nation in the world let it not be record that we lack the moral and spiritual idealism which make we the hope of the world at the time of our birth

 the demand of we in 1976 be even great than in 1776

 it be no long enough to live and let live now we must live and help live

 we need a fresh climate in america one in which a person can breathe freely and breathe in freedom

 our recognition of the truth that wealth and happiness be not the same thing require we to measure success or failure by new criterion

 even more than the program i have describe today what this nation need be an example from its elect leader in provide the spiritual and moral leadership which no program for material progress can satisfy

 above all let we inspire young americans with a sense of excitement a sense of destiny a sense of involvement in meet the challenge we face in this great period of our history only then be they go to have any sense of satisfaction in their life

 the great privilege an individual can have be to serve in a cause big than himself we have such a cause

 how we seize the opportunity i have describe today will determine not only our future but the future of peace and freedom in this world in the last third of the century

 may god give we the wisdom the strength and above all the idealism to be worthy of that challenge so that america can fulfill its destiny of be the world 's good hope for liberty for opportunity for progress and peace for all people



good evening my fellow americans
 ten day ago in my report to the nation on vietnam i announce a decision to withdraw an additional 150,000 americans from vietnam over the next year i say then that i be make that decision despite our concern over increase enemy activity in laos in cambodia and in south vietnam
 at that time i warn that if i conclude that increase enemy activity in any of these area endanger the five of americans remain in vietnam i would not hesitate to take strong and effective measure to deal with that situation
 despite that warning north vietnam have increase its military aggression in all these area and particularly in cambodia
 after full consultation with the national security council ambassador bunker general abrams and my other adviser i have conclude that the action of the enemy in the last 10 day clearly endanger the life of americans who be in vietnam now and would constitute an unacceptable risk to those who will be there after withdrawal of another 150,000
 to protect our man who be in vietnam and to guarantee the continued success of our withdrawal and vietnamization program i have conclude that the time have come for action
 tonight i shall describe the action of the enemy the action i have order to deal with that situation and the reason for my decision
 cambodia a small country of 7 million people have be a neutral nation since the geneva agreement of 1954 an agreement incidentally which be sign by the government of north vietnam
 american policy since then have be to scrupulously respect the neutrality of the cambodian people we have maintain a skeleton diplomatic mission of few than 15 in cambodia 's capital and that only since last august for the previous 4 year from 1965 to 1969 we do not have any diplomatic mission whatever in cambodia and for the past 5 year we have provide no military assistance whatever and no economic assistance to cambodia
 north vietnam however have not respect that neutrality
 for the past 5 year as indicate on this map that you see here north vietnam have occupy military sanctuary all along the cambodian frontier with south vietnam some of these extend up to 20 mile into cambodia the sanctuary be in red and as you note they be on both side of the border they be use for hit and run attack on american and south vietnamese force in south vietnam
 these communist occupy territory contain major base camp training site logistic facility weapon and ammunition factory airstrip and prisoner of war compound
 for 5 year neither the united states nor south vietnam have move against these enemy sanctuary because we do not wish to violate the territory of a neutral nation even after the vietnamese communists begin to expand these sanctuary four week ago we counsel patience to our south vietnamese ally and impose restraint on our own commander
 in contrast to our policy the enemy in the past two week have step up his guerrilla action and he be concentrate his main force in these sanctuary that you see on this map where they be build up to launch massive attack on our force and those of south vietnam
 north vietnam in the last two week have strip away all pretense of respect the sovereignty or the neutrality of cambodia thousand of their soldier be invade the country from the sanctuary they be encircle the capital of phnom penh come from these sanctuary as you see here they have move into cambodia and be encircle the capital
 cambodia as a result of this have send out a call to the united states to a number of other nation for assistance because if this enemy effort succeed cambodia would become a vast enemy staging area and a springboard for attack on south vietnam along 600 mile of frontier a refuge where enemy troop could return from combat without fear of retaliation
 north vietnamese man and supply could then be pour into that country jeopardize not only the life of our own man but the people of south vietnam as well
 now confront with this situation we have three option
 first we can do nothing well the ultimate result of that course of action be clear unless we indulge in wishful thinking the life of americans remain in vietnam after our next withdrawal of 150,000 would be gravely threaten
 let we go to the map again here be south vietnam here be north vietnam north vietnam already occupy this part of laos if north vietnam also occupy this whole band in cambodia or the entire country it would mean that south vietnam be completely outflank and the force of americans in this area as well as the south vietnamese would be in an untenable military position
 our second choice be to provide massive military assistance to cambodia itself now unfortunately while we deeply sympathize with the plight of seven million cambodians whose country be be invade massive amount of military assistance could not be rapidly and effectively utilize by the small cambodian army against the immediate threat with other nation we shall do our good to provide the small arm and other equipment which the cambodian army of 40,000 need and can use for its defense but the aid we will provide will be limit to the purpose of enable cambodia to defend its neutrality and not for the purpose of make it an active belligerent on one side or the other
 our third choice be to go to the heart of the trouble that mean clean out major north vietnamese and vietcong occupy territory these sanctuary which serve as basis for attack on both cambodia and american and south vietnamese force in south vietnam some of these incidentally be as close to saigon as baltimore be to washington this one for example indicate be call the parrot 's beak it be only 33 mile from saigon
 now face with these three option this be the decision i have make
 in cooperation with the armed force of south vietnam attack be be launch this week to clean out major enemy sanctuary on the cambodian vietnam border
 a major responsibility for the ground operation be be assume by south vietnamese force for example the attack in several area include the parrot 's beak that i refer to a moment ago be exclusively south vietnamese ground operation under south vietnamese command with the united states provide air and logistical support
 there be one area however immediately above parrot 's beak where i have conclude that a combine american and south vietnamese operation be necessary
 tonight american and south vietnamese unit will attack the headquarters for the entire communist military operation in south vietnam this key control center have be occupy by the north vietnamese and vietcong for five year in blatant violation of cambodia 's neutrality
 this be not an invasion of cambodia the area in which these attack will be launch be completely occupy and control by north vietnamese force our purpose be not to occupy the area once enemy force be drive out of these sanctuary and once their military supply be destroy we will withdraw
 these action be in no way direct to the security interest of any nation any government that choose to use these action as a pretext for harm relation with the united states will be do so on its own responsibility and on its own initiative and we will draw the appropriate conclusion
 now let i give you the reason for my decision
 a majority of the american people a majority of you listen to i be for the withdrawal of our force from vietnam the action i have take tonight be indispensable for the continue success of that withdrawal program
 a majority of the american people want to end this war rather than to have it drag on interminably the action i have take tonight will serve that purpose
 a majority of the american people want to keep the casualty of our brave man in vietnam at an absolute minimum the action i take tonight be essential if we be to accomplish that goal
 we take this action not for the purpose of expand the war into cambodia but for the purpose of end the war in vietnam and win the just peace we all desire we have make we will continue to make every possible effort to end this war through negotiation at the conference table rather than through more fighting on the battlefield
 let we look again at the record we have stop the bombing of north vietnam we have cut air operation by over 20 percent we have announce withdrawal of over 250,000 of our man we have offer to withdraw all of our man if they will withdraw theirs we have offer to negotiate all issue with only one condition and that be that the future of south vietnam be determine not by north vietnam and not by the united states but by the people of south vietnam themselves
 the answer of the enemy have be intransigence at the conference table belligerence in hanoi massive military aggression in laos and cambodia and step up attack in south vietnam design to increase american casualty
 this attitude have become intolerable we will not react to this threat to american life merely by plaintive diplomatic protest if we do the credibility of the united states would be destroy in every area of the world where only the power of the united states deter aggression
 tonight i again warn the north vietnamese that if they continue to escalate the fighting when the united states be withdraw its force i shall meet my responsibility as commander in chief of our armed forces to take the action i consider necessary to defend the security of our american man
 the action that i have announce tonight put the leader of north vietnam on notice that we will be patient in work for peace we will be conciliatory at the conference table but we will not be humiliate we will not be defeat we will not allow american man by the thousand to be kill by an enemy from privileged sanctuary
 the time come long ago to end this war through peaceful negotiation we stand ready for those negotiation we have make major effort many of which must remain secret i say tonight all the offer and approach make previously remain on the conference table whenever hanoi be ready to negotiate seriously
 but if the enemy response to our most conciliatory offer for peaceful negotiation continue to be to increase its attack and humiliate and defeat we we shall react accordingly
 my fellow americans we live in an age of anarchy both abroad and at home we see mindless attack on all the great institution which have be create by free civilization in the last 500 year even here in the united states great university be be systematically destroy small nation all over the world find themselves under attack from within and from without
 if when the chip be down the world 's most powerful nation the united states of america act like a pitiful helpless giant the force of totalitarianism and anarchy will threaten free nation and free institution throughout the world
 it be not our power but our will and character that be be test tonight the question all americans must ask and answer tonight be this do the rich and strong nation in the history of the world have the character to meet a direct challenge by a group which reject every effort to win a just peace ignore our warning trample on solemn agreement violate the neutrality of an unarmed people and use our prisoner as hostage
 if we fail to meet this challenge all other nation will be on notice that despite its overwhelming power the united states when a real crisis come will be find want
 during my campaign for the presidency i pledge to bring americans home from vietnam they be come home
 i promise to end this war i shall keep that promise
 i promise to win a just peace i shall keep that promise
 we shall avoid a wide war but we be also determined to put an end to this war
 in this room woodrow wilson make the great decision which lead to victory in world war i. franklin roosevelt make the decision which lead to our victory in world war ii dwight d. eisenhower make decision which end the war in korea and avoid war in the middle east john f. kennedy in his fine hour make the great decision which remove soviet nuclear missile from cuba and the western hemisphere
 i have note that there have be a great deal of discussion with regard to this decision that i have make and i should point out that i do not contend that it be in the same magnitude as these decision that i have just mention but between those decision and this decision there be a difference that be very fundamental in those decision the american people be not assail by counsel of doubt and defeat from some of the most widely know opinion leader of the nation
 i have note for example that a republican senator have say that this action i have take mean that my party have lose all chance of win the november election and other be say today that this move against enemy sanctuary will make i a one term president
 no one be more aware than i be of the political consequence of the action i have take it be tempting to take the easy political path to blame this war on previous administration and to bring all of our man home immediately regardless of the consequence even though that would mean defeat for the united states to desert 18 million south vietnamese people who have put their trust in we and to expose they to the same slaughter and savagery which the leader of north vietnam inflict on hundred of thousand of north vietnamese who choose freedom when the communists take over north vietnam in 1954 to get peace at any price now even though i know that a peace of humiliation for the united states would lead to a big war or surrender later
 i have reject all political consideration in make this decision
 whether my party gain in november be nothing compare to the life of 400,000 brave americans fight for our country and for the cause of peace and freedom in vietnam whether i may be a one term president be insignificant compare to whether by our failure to act in this crisis the united states prove itself to be unworthy to lead the force of freedom in this critical period in world history i would rather be a one term president and do what i believe be right than to be a two term president at the cost of see america become a second rate power and to see this nation accept the first defeat in its proud 190 year history
 i realize that in this war there be honest and deep difference in this country about whether we should have become involve that there be difference as to how the war should have be conduct but the decision i announce tonight transcend those difference
 for the life of american man be involve the opportunity for americans to come home in the next 12 month be involve the future of 18 million people in south vietnam and 7 million people in cambodia be involve the possibility of win a just peace in vietnam and in the pacific be at stake
 it be customary to conclude a speech from the white house by ask support for the president of the united states tonight i depart from that precedent what i ask be far more important i ask for your support for our brave man fight tonight halfway around the world not for territory not for glory but so that their young brother and their son and your son can have a chance to grow up in a world of peace and freedom and justice
 thank you and good night

mr. speaker mr. president my colleague in the congress our distinguished guest my fellow americans

 as this 92nd congress begin its session america have lose a great senator and all of we who have the privilege to know he have lose a loyal friend i have the privilege of visit senator russell in the hospital just a few day before he die he never speak about himself he only speak eloquently about the need for a strong national defense

 in tribute to one of the most magnificent americans of all time i respectfully ask that all those here will rise in silent prayer for senator russell

 moment of silence

 thank you

 mr. speaker before i begin my formal address i want to use this opportunity to congratulate all of those who be winner in the rather spirited contest for leadership position in the house and the senate and also to express my condolence to the loser i know how both of you feel

 and i particularly want to join with all of the member of the house and the senate as well in congratulate the new speaker of the united states congress

 to those new member of this house who may have some doubt about the possibility for advancement in the year ahead i would remind you that the speaker and i meet just 24 year ago in this chamber as freshman member of the 80th congress as you see we both have come up in the world a bit since then

 mr. speaker this 92nd congress have a chance to be record as the great congress in america 's history

 in these troubled year just past america have be go through a long nightmare of war and division of crime and inflation even more deeply we have go through a long dark night of the american spirit but now that night be end now we must let our spirit soar again now we be ready for the lift of a drive dream

 the people of this nation be eager to get on with the quest for new greatness they see challenge and they be prepared to meet those challenge it be for we here to open the door that will set free again the real greatness of this nation the genius of the american people

 how shall we meet this challenge how can we truly open the door and set free the full genius of our people

 the way in which the 92nd congress answer these question will determine its place in history more importantly it can determine this nation 's place in history as we enter the third century of our independence

 tonight i shall present to the congress six great goal i shall ask not simply for more new program in the old framework i shall ask to change the framework of government itself to reform the entire structure of american government so we can make it again fully responsive to the need and the wish of the american people

 if we act boldly if we seize this moment and achieve these goal we can close the gap between promise and performance in american government we can bring together the resource of this nation and the spirit of the american people

 in discuss these great goal i shall deal tonight only with matter on the domestic side of the nation 's agenda i shall make a separate report to the congress and the nation next month on development in foreign policy

 the first of these great goal be already before the congress

 i urge that the unfinished business of the 91st congress be make the first priority business of the 92nd congress

 over the next two week i will call upon congress to take action on more than 35 piece of propose legislation on which action be not complete last year

 the most important be welfare reform

 the present welfare system have become a monstrous consume outrage an outrage against the community against the taxpayer and particularly against the child it be suppose to help

 we may honestly disagree as we do on what to do about it but we can all agree that we must meet the challenge not by pour more money into a bad program but by abolish the present welfare system and adopt a new one

 so let we place a floor under the income of every family with child in america and without those demeaning soul stifle affront to human dignity that so blight the life of welfare child today but let we also establish an effective work incentive and an effective work requirement

 let we provide the mean by which more can help themselves this shall be our goal

 let we generously help those who be not able to help themselves but let we stop help those who be able to help themselves but refuse to do so

 the second great goal be to achieve what americans have not enjoy since 1957 full prosperity in peacetime

 the tide of inflation have turn the rise in the cost of living which have be gather dangerous momentum in the late sixty be reduce last year inflation will be far reduce this year

 but as we have move from runaway inflation toward reasonable price stability and at the same time as we have be move from a wartime economy to a peacetime economy we have pay a price in increase unemployment

 we should take no comfort from the fact that the level of unemployment in this transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy be low than in any peacetime year of the sixty

 this be not good enough for the man who be unemployed in the 70 we must do well for worker in peacetime and we will do well

 to achieve this i will submit an expansionary budget this year one that will help stimulate the economy and thereby open up new job opportunity for million of americans

 it will be a full employment budget a budget design to be in balance if the economy be operate at its peak potential by spending as if we be at full employment we will help to bring about full employment

 i ask the congress to accept these expansionary policy to accept the concept of a full employment budget at the same time i ask the congress to cooperate in resist expenditure that go beyond the limit of the full employment budget for as we wage a campaign to bring about a widely share prosperity we must not reignite the fire of inflation and so undermine that prosperity

 with the stimulus and the discipline of a full employment budget with the commitment of the independent federal reserve system to provide fully for the monetary need of a grow economy and with a much great effort on the part of labor and management to make their wage and price decision in the light of the national interest and their own self interest then for the worker the farmer the consumer for americans everywhere we shall gain the goal of a new prosperity more job more income more profit without inflation and without war

 this be a great goal and one that we can achieve together

 the third great goal be to continue the effort so dramatically begin last year to restore and enhance our natural environment

 building on the foundation lay in the 37 point program that i submit to congress last year i will propose a strong new set of initiative to clean up our air and water to combat noise and to preserve and restore our surrounding

 i will propose program to make well use of our land to encourage a balanced national growth growth that will revitalize our rural heartland and enhance the quality of life in america

 and not only to meet today 's need but to anticipate those of tomorrow i will put forward the most extensive program ever propose by a president of the united states to expand the nation 's park recreation area open space in a way that truly bring park to the people where the people be for only if we leave a legacy of park will the next generation have park to enjoy

 as a fourth great goal i will offer a far reach set of proposal for improve america 's health care and make it available more fairly to more people

 i will propose

 a program to insure that no american family will be prevent from obtain basic medical care by inability to pay

 i will propose a major increase in and redirection of aid to medical school to greatly increase the number of doctor and other health personnel

 incentive to improve the delivery of health service to get more medical care resource into those area that have not be adequately serve to make great use of medical assistant and to slow the alarming rise in the cost of medical care

 new program to encourage well preventive medicine by attack the cause of disease and injury and by provide incentive to doctor to keep people well rather than just to treat they when they be sick

 i will also ask for an appropriation of an extra $ 100 million to launch an intensive campaign to find a cure for cancer and i will ask later for whatever additional fund can effectively be use the time have come in america when the same kind of concentrated effort that split the atom and take man to the moon should be turn toward conquer this dread disease let we make a total national commitment to achieve this goal

 america have long be the wealthy nation in the world now it be time we become the healthy nation in the world

 the fifth great goal be to strengthen and to renew our state and local government

 as we approach our 200th anniversary in 1976 we remember that this nation launch itself as a loose confederation of separate state without a workable central government at that time the mark of its leader vision be that they quickly see the need to balance the separate power of the state with a government of central power

 and so they give we a constitution of balanced power of unity with diversity and so clear be their vision that it survive today as the old write constitution still in force in the world

 for almost two century since and dramatically in the 1930 at those great turning point when the question have be between the state and the federal government that question have be resolve in favor of a strong central federal government

 during this time the nation grow and the nation prosper but one thing history tell we be that no great movement go in the same direction forever nation change they adapt or they slowly die

 the time have now come in america to reverse the flow of power and resource from the state and community to washington and start power and resource flow back from washington to the state and community and more important to the people all across america

 the time have come for a new partnership between the federal government and the state and locality a partnership in which we entrust the state and locality with a large share of the nation 's responsibility and in which we share our federal revenue with they so that they can meet those responsibility

 to achieve this goal i propose to the congress tonight that we enact a plan of revenue sharing historic in scope and bold in concept

 all across america today state and city be confront with a financial crisis some have already be cut back on essential service for example just recently san diego and cleveland cut back on trash collection most be catch between the prospect of bankruptcy on the one hand and add to an already crush tax burden on the other

 as one indication of the rise cost of local government i discover the other day that my home town of whittier california which have a population of 67,000 have a large budget for 1971 than the entire federal budget be in 1791

 now the time have come to take a new direction and once again to introduce a new and more creative balance to our approach to government

 so let we put the money where the need be and let we put the power to spend it where the people be

 i propose that the congress make a $ 16 billion investment in renew state and local government five billion dollar of this will be in new and unrestricted fund to be use as the state and locality see fit the other $ 11 billion will be provide by allocate $ 1 billion of new fund and convert one third of the money go to the present narrow purpose aid program into federal revenue sharing fund for six broad purpose for urban development rural development education transportation job training and law enforcement but with the state and localite make their own decision on how it should be spend within each category

 for the next fiscal year this would increase total federal aid to the state and locality more than 25 percent over the present level

 the revenue sharing proposal i send to the congress will include the safeguard against discrimination that accompany all other federal fund allocate to the state neither the president nor the congress nor the conscience of this nation can permit money which come from all the people to be use in a way which discriminate against some of the people

 the federal government will still have a large and vital role to play in achieve our national progress establish function that be clearly and essentially federal in nature will still be perform by the federal government new function that need to be sponsor or perform by the federal government such as those i have urge tonight in welfare and health will be add to the federal agenda whenever it make the good sense for we to act as a whole nation the federal government should and will lead the way but where state or local government can well do what need to be do let we see that they have the resource to do it there

 under this plan the federal government will provide the state and locality with more money and less interference and by cut down the interference the same amount of money will go a lot far

 let we share our resource

 let we share they to rescue the state and locality from the brink of financial crisis

 let we share they to give homeowner and wage earner a chance to escape from ever high property taxis and sale taxis

 let we share our resource for two other reason as well

 the first of these reason have to do with government itself and the second have to do with each of we with the individual

 let us face it most americans today be simply feed up with government at all level they will not and they should not continue to tolerate the gap between promise and performance in government

 the fact be that we have make the federal government so strong it grow muscle bind and the state and locality so weak they approach impotence

 if we put more power in more place we can make government more creative in more place that way we multiply the number of people with the ability to make thing happen and we can open the way to a new burst of creative energy throughout america

 the final reason i urge this historic shift be much more personal for each and for every one of we

 as everything seem to have grow big and more complex in america as the force that shape our life seem to have grow more distant and more impersonal a great feeling of frustration have creep across this land

 whether it be the workingman who feel neglect the black man who feel oppress or the mother concern about her child there have be a grow feeling that thing be in the saddle and ride mankind

 millions of frustrated young americans today be cry out ask not what will government do for i but what can i do how can i contribute how can i matter

 and so let we answer they let we say to they and let we say to all americans we hear you we will give you a chance we be go to give you a new chance to have more to say about the decision that affect your future a chance to participate in government because we be go to provide more center of power where what you do can make a difference that you can see and feel in your own life and the life of your whole community

 the far away government be from people the strong government become and the weak people become and a nation with a strong government and a weak people be an empty shell

 i reject the patronizing idea that government in washington d.c. be inevitably more wise more honest and more efficient than government at the local or state level the honesty and efficiency of government depend on people government at all level have good people and bad people and the way to get more good people into government be to give they more opportunity to do good thing

 the idea that a bureaucratic elite in washington know good what be good for people everywhere and that you can not trust local government be really a contention that you can not trust people to govern themselves this notion be completely foreign to the american experience local government be the government close to the people it be most responsive to the individual person it be people 's government in a far more intimate way than the government in washington can ever be

 people come to america because they want to determine their own future rather than to live in a country where other determine their future for they

 what this change mean be that once again in america we be place our trust in people

 i have faith in people i trust the judgment of people let we give the people of america a chance a big voice in decide for themselves those question that so greatly affect their life

 the sixth great goal be a complete reform of the federal government itself

 base on a long and intensive study with the aid of the good advice obtainable i have conclude that a sweeping reorganization of the executive branch be need if the government be to keep up with the time and with the need of the people

 i propose therefore that we reduce the present 12 cabinet department to eight

 i propose that the departments of state treasury defense and justice remain but that all the other department be consolidate into four human resources community development natural resources and economic development

 let we look at what these would be

 first a department deal with the concern of people as individual as member of a family a department focus on human need

 second a department concern with the community rural community and urban community and with all that it take to make a community function as a community

 third a department concern with our physical environment with the preservation and balanced use of those great natural resource on which our nation depend

 and fourth a department concern with our prosperity with our job our business and those many activity that keep our economy run smoothly and well

 under this plan rather than divide up our department by narrow subject we would organize they around the great purpose of government rather than scatter responsibility by add new level of bureaucracy we would focus and concentrate the responsibility for get problem solve

 with these four department when we have a problem we will know where to go and the department will have the authority and the resource to do something about it

 over the year we have add department and create agency at the federal level each to serve a new constituency to handle a particular task and these have grow and multiply in what have become a hopeless confusion of form and function

 the time have come to match our structure to our purpose to look with a fresh eye to organize the government by conscious comprehensive design to meet the new need of a new era

 one hundred year ago abraham lincoln stand on a battlefield and speak of a government of the people by the people for the people too often since then we have become a nation of the government by the government for the government

 by enact these reform we can renew that principle that lincoln state so simply and so well

 by give everyone 's voice a chance to be hear we will have government that truly be of the people

 by create more center of meaningful power more place where decision that really count can be make by give more people a chance to do something we can have government that truly be by the people

 and by set up a completely modern functional system of government at the national level we in washington will at last be able to provide government that be truly for the people

 i realize that what i be ask be that not only the executive branch in washington but that even this congress will have to change by give up some of its power

 change be hard but without change there can be no progress and for each of we the question then become not will change cause i inconvenience but will change bring progress for america

 give up power be hard but i would urge all of you as leader of this country to remember that the truly revere leader in world history be those who give power to people and not those who take it away

 as we consider these reform we will be act not for the next two year or for the next ten year but for the next 100 year

 so let we approach these six great goal with a sense not only of this moment in history but also of history itself

 let we act with the willingness to work together and the vision and the boldness and the courage of those great americans who meet in philadelphia almost 190 year ago to write a constitution

 let we leave a heritage as they do not just for our child but for million yet unborn of a nation where every american will have a chance not only to live in peace and to enjoy prosperity and opportunity but to participate in a system of government where he know not only his vote but his idea count a system of government which will provide the mean for america to reach height of achievement undreame of before

 those man who meet at philadelphia leave a great heritage because they have a vision not only of what the nation be but of what it could become

 as i think of that vision i recall that america be found as the land of the open door as a haven for the oppress a land of opportunity a place of refuge of hope

 when the first settler open the door of america three and a half century ago they come to escape persecution and to find opportunity and they leave wide the door of welcome for other to follow

 when the 13 colonies declare their independence almost two century ago they open the door to a new vision of liberty and of human fulfillment not just for an elite but for all

 to the generation that follow america 's be the open door that beckon million from the old world to the new in search of a well life a free life a full life and in which by their own decision they could shape their own destiny

 for the black american the indian the mexican american and for those other in our land who have not have an equal chance the nation at last have begin to confront the need to press open the door of full and equal opportunity and of human dignity

 for all americans with these change i have propose tonight we can open the door to a new era of opportunity we can open the door to full and effective participation in the decision that affect their life we can open the door to a new partnership among government at all level between those government and the people themselves and by so do we can open wide the door of human fulfillment for million of people here in america now and in the year to come

 in the next few week i will spell out in great detail the way i propose that we achieve these six great goal i ask this congress to be responsive if it be then the 92nd congress your congress our congress at the end of its term will be able to look back on a record more splendid than any in our history

 this can be the congress that help we end the long war in the nation 's history and end it in a way that will give we at last a genuine chance to enjoy what we have not have in this century a full generation of peace

 this can be the congress that help achieve an expand economy with full employment and without inflation and without the deadly stimulus of war

 this can be the congress that reform a welfare system that have rob recipient of their dignity and rob state and city of their resource

 this can be the congress that press forward the rescue of our environment and establish for the next generation an endure legacy of park for the people

 this can be the congress that launch a new era in american medicine in which the quality of medical care be enhance while the cost be make less burdensome

 but above all what this congress can be remember for be open the way to a new american revolution a peaceful revolution in which power be turn back to the people in which government at all level be refresh and renew and make truly responsive this can be a revolution as profound as far reach as exciting as that first revolution almost 200 year ago and it can mean that just five year from now america will enter its third century as a young nation new in spirit with all the vigor and the freshness with which it begin its first century

 my colleague in the congress these be great goal they can make the session of this congress a great moment for america so let we pledge together to go forward together by achieve these goal to give america the foundation today for a new greatness tomorrow and in all the year to come and in so do to make this the great congress in the history of this great and good country



good morning my fellow americans
 over the past ten year president of the united states have come before the american people in time of crisis to talk about war or the threat of war
 today i be able to talk to you in a more hopeful and positive vein about how we be move this nation and the world toward a last peace
 we have bring ourselves to a time of transition from war toward peace and this be a good time to gain some perspective on where we be and where we be head
 today i be send to the congress my second annual comprehensive report on the conduct of our foreign affair it discuss not only what we have do but why we have do it and how we intend to proceed in the future
 i do not intend to summarize all that be in my detailed report on foreign policy at this time instead i would like to focus on three key point
 how we be get out of the war this nation have be in for the past six year
 how we have create a new and different foreign policy approach for the united states in a greatly change world and
 how we be apply that approach in work with other to build a last peace
 the most immediate and anguishing problem that face this administration two year ago be the war in vietnam
 we have come a long way since then
 two year ago when this administration take office there be almost 550,000 americans in vietnam within 60 day we will have bring home 260,000 man and this spring i will announce a new schedule of withdrawal
 two year ago our casualty each month be five time as high as they be today
 two year ago the additional demand of the vietnam war cost we approximately $ 22 billion per year that cost have be cut in half
 much of the progress in vietnam be due to the success of the ally operation against the enemy sanctuary in cambodia last spring
 the clear proof be in this figure american casualty after cambodia have be half the rate they be before cambodia our decision to clean out the sanctuary in cambodia save thousand of american life and it enable we to continue withdraw our man on schedule
 just as last year 's cutoff of supply through cambodia have save life and insure our withdrawal program this year the purpose of this year 's disruption of the ho chi minh trail in laos be to save life and insure the success of our withdrawal program next year
 the disruption of the communist supply line through laos be be accomplish by south vietnamese troop with no u.s. ground troop or adviser their army be do the fighting with our air support and the intensity of the fighting be evidence of the importance of that supply line to the enemy
 consider this combination of event that many people think be impossible only two year ago
 we have keep our commitment as we have take out our troop south vietnam now have an excellent opportunity not only to survive but to build a strong free society
 thank to the disruption of so much of the enemy 's supply americans be leave south vietnam in safety we would much prefer to leave south vietnam in peace negotiation remain the good and quick way to end the war in a way that will not only end u.s. involvement and casualty but will mean an end to the fighting between north and south vietnamese
 on october 7 we make a proposal that could open the door to that kind of peace we propose
 an immediate standstill cease fire throughout indochina to stop the fighting
 an indochina peace conference
 the withdrawal of all outside force
 a political settlement fair to both side
 the immediate release of all prisoner of war
 i reaffirm that proposal today it be support by every government in indochina except one the government of north vietnam
 i once again urge hanoi to join we in this search for peace
 if north vietnam wish to negotiate with the united states they will have to recognize that time be run out with the exception of the prisoner of war issue if north vietnam continue to refuse to discuss our peace proposal they will soon find they have no choice but to negotiate only with the south vietnamese
 our eventual goal be a total withdrawal of all outside force but as long as north vietnam continue to hold a single american prisoner we shall have force in south vietnam the american prisoner of war will not be forget by their government
 i be keep my pledge to end america 's involvement in this war but the main point i want to discuss with you today and the main theme of my report to the congress be the future not the past it matter very much how we end this war
 to end a war be simple
 but to end a war in a way that will not bring on another war be far from simple
 in southeast asia today aggression be fail thank to the determination of the south vietnamese people and to the courage and sacrifice of america 's fight man
 that bring we to a point that we have be at several time before in this century aggression train back a war end
 we be at a critical moment in history what america do or fail to do will determine whether peace and freedom can be win in the come generation
 that be why the way in which we end this conflict be so crucial to our effort to build a last peace in come decade
 the right way out of vietnam be crucial to our change role in the world and to peace in the world
 to understand the nature of the new american role we must consider the great historical change that have take place
 for 25 year after world war ii the united states be not only the leader of the non communist world it be the primary supporter and defender of this free world as well
 but today our ally and friend have gain new strength and self confidence they be now able to participate much more fully not only in their own defense but in add their moral and spiritual strength to the creation of a stable world order
 today our adversary no long present a solidly unite front we can now differentiate in our dealing with they
 today neither the united states nor the soviet union have a clear cut nuclear advantage the time be therefore ripe to come to an agreement on the control of arm
 the world have change our foreign policy must change with it
 we have learn in recent year the danger of over involvement the other danger a grave risk we be equally determined to avoid be under involvement after a long and unpopular war there be temptation to turn inward to withdraw from the world to back away from our commitment that deceptively smooth road of the new isolationism be surely the road to war
 our foreign policy today steer a steady course between the past danger of over involvement and the new temptation of under involvement
 that policy which i first enunciate in guam 19 month ago represent our basic approach to the world
 we will maintain our commitment but we will make sure our own troop level or any financial support to other nation be appropriate to current threat and need
 we shall provide a shield if a nuclear power threaten the freedom of a nation ally with we or of a nation whose survival we consider vital to our security
 but we will look to threaten country and their neighbor to assume primary responsibility for their own defense and we will provide support where our interest call for that support and where it can make a difference
 these principle be not limit to security matter
 we shall pursue economic policy at home and abroad that encourage trade wherever possible and that strengthen political tie between nation as we actively seek to help other nation expand their economy we can legitimately expect they to work with we in avert economic problem of our own
 as we continue to send economic aid to develop nation we will expect country on the receive end to mobilize their resource we will look to other develop nation to do more in furnish assistance and we will channel our aid increasingly through group of nation band together for mutual support
 this new sharing of responsibility require not less american leadership than in the past but rather a new more subtle form of leadership no single nation can build a peace alone peace can only be build by the willing hand and mind of all in the modern world leadership can not be do it yourself"—the path of leadership be in provide the help the motive the inspiration to do it together
 in carry out what be refer to as the nixon doctrine we recognize that we can not transfer burden too swiftly we must strike a balance between do too much and prevent self reliance and suddenly do too little and undermine self confidence we intend to give our friend the time and the mean to adjust materially and psychologically to a new form of american participation in the world
 how have we apply our new foreign policy during the past year and what be our future agenda as we work with other to build a stable world order
 in western europe we have shift from predominance to partnership with our ally our tie with western europe be central to the structure of peace because its nation be rich in tradition and experience strong economically vigorous in diplomacy and culture they be in a position to take a major part in build a world of peace
 our tie be strengthen on my second trip to europe this summer and reflect in our close consultation on arm control negotiation at our suggestion the nato alliance make a thorough review of its military strategy and posture as a result we have reach new agreement on a strong defense and the need to share the burden more fairly
 in eastern europe our exchange of state visit with romania and my meeting last fall with marshal tito in yugoslavia be example of our search for wide reconciliation with the nation that use to be consider behind an iron curtain
 look ahead in europe
 we shall cooperate in our political and economic relation across the atlantic as the common market grow
 we and our ally will make the improvement necessary to carry out our common defense strategy
 together we stand ready to reduce force in western europe in exchange for mutual reduction in eastern europe
 the problem of africa be great but so be her potential the united states will support her people effort to build a continent that provide social justice and economic expansion
 turn to our own hemisphere in latin america there be too much tendency in the past to take our close friend and neighbor for grant recently we have pay new respect to their proud tradition our trade credit and economic policy have be reexamine and reform to respond to their concern and their idea as well as to our own interest
 our new latin american policy be design to help they help themselves our new attitude will not only aid their progress but add to their dignity
 great change be brew throughout the american hemisphere we can have no great goal than to help provide the mean for necessary change to be accomplish in peace and for all change to be in the direction of great self reliance
 turn to the far east a new asia be emerge the old enmity of world war ii be dead or die asian state be strong and be join together in vigorous regional grouping
 here the doctrine that take shape last year be take hold today help to spur self reliance and cooperation between state in japan south korea thailand and the philippines we have consolidate basis and reduce american force we have relax trade and travel restriction to underline our readiness for great contact with communist china
 look ahead in that area
 while continue to help our friend help themselves we must begin to consider how regional association can work together with the major power in the area for a durable peace
 we will work to build a strong partnership with japan that will accommodate our mutual interest
 we will search for consecutive discussion with communist china while maintain our defense commitment to taiwan when the government of the people 's republic of china be ready to engage in talk it will find we receptive to agreement that far the legitimate national interest of china and its neighbor
 in asia we can see tomorrow 's world in microcosm an economically powerful democratic free nation japan be seek new market a potentially powerful communist nation china will one day seek new outlet and new relation a communist competitor the soviet union have interest there as well and the independent non communist nation of southeast asia be already work together in regional association these great force be bind to interact in the not too distant future in the way they work together and in the way we cooperate with their relationship be the key to permanent peace in that area the far east the scene of such a painful legacy of the recent past can become an example of peace and stability in the future
 in the middle east the united states take the initiative to stop the fighting and start the process of peace
 along the suez canal a year ago there be daily combat on the ground and in the air diplomacy be at an impasse the danger of local conflict be magnify by grow soviet involvement and the possibility of great power be draw into confrontation
 america take the lead in arrange a cease fire and get negotiation start we be see to it that the balance of power so necessary to discourage a new outbreak of fighting be not upset work behind the scene when a crisis arise in jordan the united states play a key role in see that order be restore and an invasion be abandon
 we recognize that century of suspicion and decade of hostility can not be end overnight there be great obstacle in the way of a permanent peaceful settlement and painful compromise be require by all concern
 we be encourage by the willingness of each of the party to begin to look to the large interest of peace and stability throughout the middle east there be still the risk of war but now for the first time in year the party be actively calculate the risk of peace
 the policy of the united states will continue to be to promote peace talk not to try to impose a peace from the outside but to support the peace effort of the party in the region themselves
 one way to support these effort be for the united states to discourage any outside power from try to exploit the situation for its own advantage
 another way for we to help turn a tenuous truce into a permanent settlement be this the united states be fully prepared to play a responsible and cooperative role in keep the peace arrive at through negotiation between the party
 we know what our vital interest be in the middle east those interest include friendly and constructive relation with all nation in the area other nation know that we be ready to protect those vital interest and one good reason why other nation take we at our word in the middle east be because the united states have keep its word in southeast asia
 we now come to a matter that affect every nation the relation between the world 's two great super power
 over the past year in some field the soviet union and the united states have move ahead together we have take the first step toward cooperation in outer space we have both ratify the treaty limit the spread of nuclear weapon just two week ago we sign a treaty to prohibit nuclear weapon from the seabed
 these be hopeful sign but certain other soviet action be reason for concern there be need for much more cooperation in reduce tension in the middle east and in end harassment of berlin we must also discourage the temptation to raise new challenge in sensitive area such as the caribbean
 in the long run the most significant result of negotiation between the super power in the past year could be in the field of arm control
 the strategic arm limitation talk with the soviet union have produce the most searching examination of the nature of strategic competition ever conduct between our two nation each side have have the chance to explain at length the concern cause by the posture of the other side the talk have be conduct in a serious way without the old lapse into propaganda
 if both side continue in this way there be reason to hope that specific agreement will be reach to curb the arm race
 take a first step in limit the capacity of mankind to destroy itself would mark a turning point in the history of the postwar world it would add to the security of both the soviet union and the united states and it would add to the world 's peace of mind
 in all our relation with the soviets we shall make the most progress by recognize that in many case our national interest be not the same it serve no purpose to pretend they be our difference be not matter of mood they be matter of substance but in many other case our separate national interest can well be pursue by a sober consideration of the world interest
 the united states will deal as it must from strength we will not reduce our defense below the level i consider essential to our national security
 a strong america be essential to the cause of peace today until we have the kind of agreement we can rely on we shall remain strong
 but america 's power will always be use for build a peace never for break it only for defend freedom never for destroy it
 america 's strength will be as it must be second to none but the strength that this nation be proud of be the strength of our determination to create a peaceful world
 we all know how every town or city develop a sense of community when its citizen come together to meet a common need
 the common need of the world today about which there can be no disagreement or conflict of national interest be plain to see
 we know that we must act as one world in restore the world 's environment before pollution of the sea and sky overwhelm every nation we know we must stop the flow of narcotic we must counter the outbreak of hijacking and kidnaping we must share the great discovery about the ocean and outer space
 the united states be justly proud of the lead it have take in work within the united nations and within the nato alliance to come to grip with these problem and with these opportunity
 our work here be a beginning not only in cope with the new challenge of technology and modern life but of develop a worldwide sense of community that will ease tension reduce suspicion and thereby promote the process of peace
 that process can only flourish in a climate of mutual respect
 we can have that mutual respect with our friend without dominate they or without let they down
 we can have that mutual respect with our adversary without compromise our principle or weaken our resolve
 and we can have that mutual respect among ourselves without stifle dissent or lose our capacity for action
 our goal be something americans have not enjoy in this century a full generation of peace a full generation of peace depend not only on the policy of one party or of one nation or one alliance or one bloc of nation
 peace for the next generation depend on our ability to make certain that each nation have a share in its shaping and that every nation have a stake in its lasting
 this be the hard way require patience restraint understanding and when necessary bold decisive action but history have teach we that the old diplomacy of impose a peace by the fiat of great power simply do not work
 i believe that the new diplomacy of partnership of mutual respect of deal with strength and determination will work
 i believe that the right degree of american involvement not too much and not too little will evoke the right response from our other partner on this globe in build for our child the kind of world they deserve a world of opportunity in a world without war

good evening my fellow americans over the past several week you have hear a number of report on tv radio and in your newspaper on the situation in southeast asia
 i think the time have come for i as president and as commander in chief of our armed forces to put these report in perspective to lay all the pertinent fact before you and to let you judge for yourself as to the success or failure of our policy
 i be glad to be able to begin my report tonight by announce that i have decide to increase the rate of american troop withdrawal for the period from may 1 to december 1 before go into detail i would like to review briefly what i find when i come into office the progress we have make to date in reduce american force and the reason why i be able to announce a step up withdrawal without jeopardize our remain force in vietnam and without endanger our ultimate goal of end american involvement in a way which will increase the chance for a last peace in the pacific and in the world
 when i leave washington in january of 1961 after serve eight year as vice president under president eisenhower there be no american combat force in vietnam no americans have die in combat in vietnam
 when i return to washington as president eight year later there be 540,000 american troop in vietnam thirty one thousand have die there three hundred americans be be lose every week and there be no comprehensive plan to end the united states involvement in the war
 i implement a plan to train and equip the south vietnamese to withdraw american force and to end american involvement in the war just as soon as the south vietnamese have develop the capacity to defend their country against communist aggression on this chart on my right you can see how our plan have succeed in june of 1969 i announce a withdrawal of 25,000 man in september 40,000 december 50,000 april of 1970 150,000 by the first of next month may 1 we will have bring home more than 265,000 americans almost half of the troop in vietnam when i take office
 now another indication of the progress we have make be in reduce american casualty casualty be five time as great in the first 3 month of 1969 as they be in the first three month this year 1971 south vietnamese casualty have also drop significantly in the past two year one american die in combat be one too many but our goal be no american fight man die anyplace in the world every decision i have make in the past and every decision i make in the future will have the purpose of achieve that goal
 let i review now two decision i have make which have contribute to the achievement of our goal in vietnam that you have see on this chart
 the first be the destruction of enemy basis in cambodia you will recall that at the time of that decision many express fear that we have widen the war that our casualty would increase that our troop withdrawal program would be delay now i do not question the sincerity of those who express these fear but we can see now they be wrong american troop be out of cambodia in 60 day just as i pledge they would be american casualty do not rise they be cut in half american troop withdrawal be not halt or delay they continue at an accelerated pace
 now let i turn to the laotian operation as you know this be undertake by south vietnamese ground force with american air support against north vietnamese troop which have be use laotian territory for six year to attack american force and ally force in south vietnam since the completion of that operation there have be a great deal of understandable speculation just as there be after cambodia whether or not it be a success or a failure a victory or a defeat but as in cambodia what be important be not the instant analysis of the moment but what happen in the future
 do the laotian operation contribute to the goal we seek i have just complete my assessment of that operation and here be my conclusion
 first the south vietnamese demonstrate that without american adviser they could fight effectively against the very good troop north vietnam could put in the field
 second the south vietnamese suffer heavy casualty but by every conservative estimate the casualty suffer by the enemy be far heavy
 third and most important the disruption of enemy supply line the consumption of ammunition and arm in the battle have be even more damaging to the capability of the north vietnamese to sustain major offensive in south vietnam than be the operation in cambodia 10 month ago
 consequently tonight i can report that vietnamization have succeed because of the increase strength of the south vietnamese because of the success of the cambodian operation because of the achievement of the south vietnamese operation in laos i be announce an increase in the rate of american withdrawal between may 1 and december 1 of this year 100,000 more american troop will be bring home from south vietnam this will bring the total number of american troop withdraw from south vietnam to 365,000 now that be over two third of the number who be there when i come into office as you can see from this chart on my left the government of south vietnam fully support the decision i have just announce
 now let us look at the future
 as you can see from the progress we have make to date and by this announcement tonight the american involvement in vietnam be come to an end the day the south vietnamese can take over their own defense be in sight our goal be a total american withdrawal from vietnam we can and we will reach that goal through our program of vietnamization if necessary
 but we would infinitely prefer to reach it even soon through negotiation i be sure most of you will recall that on october 7 of last year in a national tv broadcast i propose an immediate cease fire throughout indochina the immediate release of all prisoner of war in the indochina area an all indochina peace conference the complete withdrawal of all outside force and a political settlement tonight i again call on hanoi to engage in serious negotiation to speed the end of this war i especially call on hanoi to agree to the immediate and unconditional release of all prisoner of war throughout indochina it be time for hanoi to end the barbaric use of our prisoner as negotiate pawn and to join we in a humane act that will free their man as well as ours
 let i turn now to a proposal which at first glance have a great deal of popular appeal if our goal be a total withdrawal of all our force why do not i announce a date now for end our involvement well the difficulty in make such an announcement to the american people be that i would also be make that announcement to the enemy and it would serve the enemy 's purpose and not our own
 if the united states should announce that we will quit regardless of what the enemy do we would have throw away our principal bargaining counter to win the release of american prisoner of war we would remove the enemy 's strong incentive to end the war soon by negotiation and we will have give enemy commander the exact information they need to marshal their attack against our remain force at their most vulnerable time
 the issue very simply be this shall we leave vietnam in a way that by our own action consciously turn the country over to the communists or shall we leave in a way that give the south vietnamese a reasonable chance to survive as a free people my plan will end american involvement in a way that would provide that chance and the other plan would end it precipitately and give victory to the communists
 in a deep sense we have the choice of end our involvement in this war on a note of despair or on a note of hope i believe as thomas jefferson do that americans will always choose hope over despair we have it in our power to leave vietnam in a way that offer a brave people a realistic hope of freedom we have it in our power to prove to our friend in the world that america 's sense of responsibility remain the world 's great single hope of peace and above all we have it in our power to close a difficult chapter in american history not meanly but nobly so that each one of we can come out of this sear experience with a measure of pride in our nation confidence in our own character and hope for the future of the spirit of america
 i know there be those who honestly believe that i should move to end this war without regard to what happen to south vietnam this way would abandon our friend but even more important we would abandon ourselves we would plunge from the anguish of war into a nightmare of recrimination we would lose respect for this nation respect for one another respect for ourselves
 i understand the deep concern which have be raise in this country fan by report of brutality in vietnam let i put this into perspective
 i have visit vietnam many time and speak now from that experience and as commander in chief of our armed forces i feel it be my duty to speak up for the two and a half million fine young americans who have serve in vietnam the atrocity charge in individual case should not and can not be allow to reflect on their courage and their self sacrifice war be a terrible and cruel experience for a nation and it be particularly terrible and cruel for those who bear the burden of fighting
 but never in history have man fight for less selfish motive not for conquest not for glory but only for the right of a people far away to choose the kind of government they want
 while we hear and read much of isolated act of cruelty we do not hear enough of the ten of thousand of individual american soldier i have see they there building school road hospital clinic who through countless act of generosity and kindness have try to help the people of south vietnam we can and we should be very proud of these man they deserve not our scorn but they deserve our admiration and our deep appreciation
 the way to express that appreciation be to end america 's participation in this conflict not in failure or in defeat but in achievement of the great goal for which they fight a south vietnam free to determine its own future and an america no long divide by war but unite in peace
 that be why it be so important how we end this war by our decision we will demonstrate the kind of people we be and the kind of country we will become
 that be why i have charter the course i have lay out tonight to end this war but end it in a way that will strengthen trust for america around the world not undermine it in a way that will redeem the sacrifice that have be make not insult they in a way that will heal this nation not tear it apart
 i can assure you tonight with confidence that american involvement in this war be come to an end
 but can you believe this i understand why this question be raise by many very honest and sincere people because many time in the past in this long and difficult war action have be announce from washington which be suppose to lead to a reduction of american involvement in vietnam and over and over these action result in more americans go to vietnam and more casualty in vietnam
 tonight i do not ask you to take what i say on faith look at the record look again at this chart on my left every action take by this administration every decision make have accomplish what i say it would accomplish they have reduce american involvement they have drastically reduce our casualty
 in my campaign for the presidency i pledge to end american involvement in this war i be keep that pledge and i expect to be hold accountable by the american people if i fail
 i be often ask what i would like to accomplish more than anything else while serve as president of the united states and i always give the same answer to bring peace peace abroad peace at home for america the reason i be so deeply committed to peace go far beyond political consideration or my concern about my place in history or the other reason that political scientist usually say be the motivation of president
 every time i talk to a brave wife of an american pow every time i write a letter to the mother of a boy who have be kill in vietnam i become more deeply committed to end this war and to end it in a way that we can build last peace
 i think the hard thing that a president have to do be to present posthumously the nation 's high honor the medal of honor to mother or father or widow of man who have lose their life but in the process have save the life of other
 we have an award ceremony in the east room of the white house just a few week ago and at that ceremony i remember one of the recipient mrs. karl taylor from pennsylvania her husband be a marine sergeant sergeant karl taylor he charge an enemy machine gun single handed and knock it out he lose his life but in the process the life of several wound marines in the range of that machine gun be save
 after i present she the medal i shake hand with their two child karl jr.—he be 8 year old and kevin who be 4 as i be about to move to the next recipient kevin suddenly stand at attention and salute i find it rather difficult to get my thought together for the next presentation
 my fellow americans i want to end this war in a way that be worthy of the sacrifice of karl taylor and i think he would want i to end it in a way that would increase the chance that kevin and karl and all those child like they here and around the world could grow up in a world where none of they would have to die in war that would increase the chance for america to have what it have not have in this century a full generation of peace
 we have come a long way in the last two year toward that goal with your continued support i believe we will achieve that goal and generation in the future will look back at this difficult try time in america 's history and they will be proud that we demonstrate that we have the courage and the character of a great people
 thank you

good afternoon lady and gentleman
 as you know the soviet american talk an limit nuclear arm have be deadlocke for over a year as a result of negotiation involve the high level of both government i be announce today a significant development in break the deadlock
 the statement that i shall now read be be issue simultaneously in moscow and washington washington 12 o'clock moscow 7 p.m.
 the government of the united states and the soviet union after review the course of their talk on the limitation of strategic armament have agree to concentrate this year on work out an agreement for the limitation of the deployment of anti ballistic missile system abms they have also agree that together with conclude an agreement to limit abm they will agree on certain measure with respect to the limitation of offensive strategic weapon
 the two side be take this course in the conviction that it will create more favorable condition for further negotiation to limit all strategic arm these negotiation will be actively pursue
 this agreement be a major step in break the stalemate on nuclear arm talk intensive negotiation however will be require to translate this understanding into a concrete agreement
 this statement that i have just read express the commitment of the soviet and american governments at the high level to achieve that goal if we succeed this joint statement that have be issue today may well be remember as the beginning of a new era in which all nation will devote more of their energy and their resource not to the weapon of war but to the work of peace

mr. speaker mr. president my colleague in the congress our distinguished guest my fellow americans

 twenty five year ago i sit here as a freshman congressman along with speaker albert and listen for the first time to the president address the state of the union

 i shall never forget that moment the senate the diplomatic corps the supreme court the cabinet enter the chamber and then the president of the united states as all of you be aware i have some difference with president truman he have some with i but i remember that on that day the day he address that joint session of the newly elect republican 80th congress he speak not as a partisan but as president of all the people call upon the congress to put aside partisan consideration in the national interest

 the greek turkish aid program the marshall plan the great foreign policy initiative which have be responsible for avoid a world war for over 25 year be approve by the 80th congress by a bipartisan majority of which i be proud to be a part

 nineteen hundred seventy two be now before we it hold precious time in which to accomplish good for the nation we must not waste it i know the political pressure in this session of the congress will be great there be more candidate for the presidency in this chamber today than there probably have be at any one time in the whole history of the republic and there be an honest difference of opinion not only between the party but within each party on some foreign policy issue and on some domestic policy issue

 however there be great national problem that be so vital that they transcend partisanship so let we have our debate let we have our honest difference but let we join in keep the national interest first let we join in make sure that legislation the nation need do not become hostage to the political interest of any party or any person

 there be ample precedent in this election year for i to present you with a huge list of new proposal know full well that there would not be any possibility of your pass they if you work night and day i shall not do that

 i have present to the leader of the congress today a message of 15,000 word discuss in some detail where the nation stand and set forth specific legislative item on which i have ask the congress to act much of this be legislation which i propose in 1969 in 1970 and also in the first session of this 92nd congress and on which i feel it be essential that action be complete this year

 i be not present proposal which have attractive label but no hope of passage i be present only vital program which be within the capacity of this congress to enact within the capacity of the budget to finance and which i believe should be above partisanship program which deal with urgent priority for the nation which should and must be the subject of bipartisan action by this congress in the interest of the country in 1972

 when i take the oath of office on the step of this building just three year ago today the nation be end one of the most tortured decade in its history

 the 1960 be a time of great progress in many area but as we all know they be also time of great agony the agony of war of inflation of rapidly rise crime of deteriorate title of hope raise and disappoint and of anger and frustration that lead finally to violence and to the bad civil disorder in a century

 i recall these trouble not to point any finger of blame the nation be so tear in those final year of the 60 that many in both party question whether america could be govern at all

 the nation have make significant progress in these first year of the 70

 our city be no long engulf by civil disorder

 our college and university have again become place of learn instead of battleground

 a beginning have be make in preserve and protect our environment

 the rate of increase in crime have be slow and here in the district of columbia the one city where the federal government have direct jurisdiction serious crime in 1971 be actually reduce by 13 percent from the year before

 most important because of the beginning that have be make we can say today that this year 1972 can be the year in which america may make the great progress in 25 year toward achieve our goal of be at peace with all the nation of the world

 as our involvement in the war in vietnam come to an end we must now go on to build a generation of peace

 to achieve that goal we must first face realistically the need to maintain our defense

 in the past three year we have reduce the burden of arm for the first time in 20 year spend on defense have be bring below spending on human resource

 as we look to the future we find encourage progress in our negotiation with the soviet union on limitation of strategic arm and look far into the future we hope there can eventually be agreement on the mutual reduction of arm but until there be such a mutual agreement we must maintain the strength necessary to deter war

 and that be why because of rise research and development cost because of increase in military and civilian pay because of the need to proceed with new weapon system my budget for the come fiscal year will provide for an increase in defense spending

 strong military defense be not the enemy of peace they be the guardian of peace

 there could be no more misguided set of priority than one which would tempt other by weaken america and thereby endanger the peace of the world

 in our foreign policy we have enter a new era the world have change greatly in the 11 year since president john kennedy say in his inaugural address we shall pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty

 our policy have be carefully and deliberately adjust to meet the new reality of the new world we live in we make today only those commitment we be able and prepare to meet

 our commitment to freedom remain strong and unshakable but other must bear their share of the burden of defend freedom around the world

 and so this then be our policy

 we will maintain a nuclear deterrent adequate to meet any threat to the security of the united states or of our ally

 we will help other nation develop the capability of defend themselves

 we will faithfully honor all of our treaty commitment

 we will act to defend our interest whenever and wherever they be threaten anyplace in the world

 but where our interest or our treaty commitment be not involve our role will be limit

 we will not intervene militarily

 but we will use our influence to prevent war

 if war come we will use our influence to stop it

 once it be over we will do our share in help to bind up the wound of those who have participate in it

 as you know i will soon be visit the people 's republic of china and the soviet union i go there with no illusion we have great difference with both power we shall continue to have great difference but peace depend on the ability of great power to live together on the same planet despite their difference

 we would not be true to our obligation to generation yet unborn if we fail to seize this moment to do everything in our power to insure that we will be able to talk about those difference rather than to fight about they in the future

 as we look back over this century let we in the high spirit of bipartisanship recognize that we can be proud of our nation 's record in foreign affair

 america have give more generously of itself toward maintain freedom preserve peace alleviate human suffering around the globe than any nation have ever do in the history of man

 we have fight four war in this century but our power have never be use to break the peace only to keep it never be use to destroy freedom only to defend it we now have within our reach the goal of insure that the next generation can be the first generation in this century to be spare the scourge of war

 turn to our problem at home we be make progress toward our goal of a new prosperity without war

 industrial production consumer spending retail sale personal income all have be rise total employment real income be the high in history new home building start this past year reach the high level ever business and consumer confidence have both be rise interest rate be down the rate of inflation be down we can look with confidence to 1972 as the year when the back of inflation will be break

 now this a good record but it be not good enough not when we still have an unemployment rate of 6 percent

 it be not enough to point out that this be the rate of the early peacetime year of the 60 or that if the more than two million man release from the armed force and defense relate industry be still in their wartime job unemployment would be far low

 our goal in this country be full employment in peacetime we intend to meet that goal and we can

 the congress have help to meet that goal by pass our job create tax program last month

 the historic monetary agreement agreement that we have reach with the major european nation canada and japan will help meet it by provide new market for american product new job for american worker

 our budget will help meet it by be expansionary without be inflationary a job produce budget that will help take up the gap as the economy expand to full employment

 our program to raise farm income will help meet it by help to revitalize rural america by give to america 's farmer their fair share of america 's increase productivity

 we also will help meet our goal of full employment in peacetime with a set of major initiative to stimulate more imaginative use of america 's great capacity for technological advance and to direct it toward improve the quality of life for every american

 in reach the moon we demonstrate what miracle american technology be capable of achieve now the time have come to move more deliberately toward make full use of that technology here on earth of harness the wonder of science to the service of man

 i shall soon send to the congress a special message propose a new program of federal partnership in technological research and development with federal incentive to increase private research federally support research on project design to improve our everyday life in way that will range from improve mass transit to develop new system of emergency health care that could save thousand of life annually

 historically our superior technology and high productivity have make it possible for american worker to be the highest pay in the world by far and yet for our good still to compete in world market

 now we face a new situation as other nation move rapidly forward in technology the answer to the new competition be not to build a wall around america but rather to remain competitive by improve our own technology still far and by increase productivity in american industry

 our new monetary and trade agreement will make it possible for american good to compete fairly in the world 's market but they still must compete the new technology program will put to use the skill of many highly train americans skill that might otherwise be waste it will also meet the grow technological challenge from abroad and it will thus help to create new industry as well as create more job for america 's worker in produce for the world 's market

 this second session of the 92nd congress already have before it more than 90 major administration proposal which still await action

 i have discuss these in the extensive write message that i have present to the congress today

 they include among other our program to improve life for the aging to combat crime and drug abuse to improve health service and to ensure that no one will be deny need health care because of inability to pay to protect worker pension right to promote equal opportunity for member of minority and other who have be leave behind to expand consumer protection to improve the environment to revitalize rural america to help the city to launch new initiative in education to improve transportation and to put an end to costly labor tie up in transportation

 the west coast dock strike be a case in point this nation can not and will not tolerate that kind of irresponsible labor tie up in the future

 the message also include basic reform which be essential if our structure of government be to be adequate in the decade ahead

 they include reform of our wasteful and outmoded welfare system substitution of a new system that provide work requirement and work incentive for those who can help themselves income support for those who can not help themselves and fairness to the work poor

 they include a $ 17 billion program of federal revenue sharing with the state and locality as an investment in their renewal an investment also of faith in the american people

 they also include a sweeping reorganization of the executive branch of the federal government so that it will be more efficient more responsive and able to meet the challenge of the decade ahead

 one year ago stand in this place i lay before the opening session of this congress six great goal one of these be welfare reform that proposal have be before the congress now for nearly two and a half year

 my proposal on revenue sharing government reorganization health care and the environment have now be before the congress for nearly a year many of the other major proposal that i have refer to have be here that long or long

 now 1971 we can say be a year of consideration of these measure now let we join in make 1972 a year of action on they action by the congress for the nation and for the people of america

 now in addition there be one press need which i have not previously cover but which must be place on the national agenda

 we long have look in this nation to the local property tax as the main source of financing for public primary and secondary education

 as a result soar school cost soar property tax rate now threaten both our community and our school they threaten community because property taxis which more than double in the 10 year from 1960 to 70 have become one of the most oppressive and discriminatory of all taxis hit most cruelly at the elderly and the retire and they threaten school as hard press voter understandably reject new bond issue at the poll

 the problem have be give even great urgency by four recent court decision which have hold that the conventional method of finance school through local property taxis be discriminatory and unconstitutional

 nearly two year ago i name a special presidential commission to study the problem of school finance and i also direct the federal department to look into the same problem we be develop comprehensive proposal to meet these problem

 this issue involve two complex and interrelated set of problem support of the school and the basic relationship of federal state and local government in any tax reform

 under the leadership of the secretary of the treasury we be carefully review all of the tax aspect and i have this week enlist the advisory commission on intergovernmental relations in address the intergovernmental relation aspect

 i have ask this bipartisan commission to review our proposal for federal action to cope with the gathering crisis of school finance and property taxis later in the year when both commission have complete their study i shall make my final recommendation for relieve the burden of property taxis and provide both fair and adequate financing for our child 's education

 these recommendation will be revolutionary but all these recommendation however will be root in one fundamental principle with which there can be no compromise local school board must have control over local school

 as we look ahead over the come decade vast new growth and change be not only certainty they will be the dominant reality of this world and particularly of our life in america

 survey the certainty of rapid change we can be like a fallen rider catch in the stirrup we can sit high in the saddle the master of change direct it on a course we choose

 the secret of master change in today 's world be to reach back to old and prove principle and to adapt they with imagination and intelligence to the new reality of a new age

 that be what we have do in the proposal that i have lay before the congress they be root in basic principle that be as enduring as human nature as robust as the american experience and they be responsive to new condition thus they represent a spirit of change that be truly renewal

 as we look back at those old principle we find they as timely as they be timeless

 we believe in independence and self reliance and the creative value of the competitive spirit

 we believe in full and equal opportunity for all americans and in the protection of individual right and liberty

 we believe in the family as the keystone of the community and in the community as the keystone of the nation

 we believe in compassion toward those in need

 we believe in a system of law justice and order as the basis of a genuinely free society

 we believe that a person should get what he work for and that those who can should work for what they get

 we believe in the capacity of people to make their own decision in their own life in their own community and we believe in their right to make those decision

 in apply these principle we have do so with the full understanding that what we seek in the seventy what our quest be be not merely for more but for well for a well quality of life for all americans

 thus for example we be give a new measure of attention to clean up our air and water make our surrounding more attractive we be provide broad support for the art help stimulate a deep appreciation of what they can contribute to the nation 's activity and to our individual life

 but nothing really matter more to the quality of our life than the way we treat one another than our capacity to live respectfully together as a unified society with a full generous regard for the right of other and also for the feeling of other

 as we recover from the turmoil and violence of recent year as we learn once again to speak with one another instead of shout at one another we be regain that capacity

 as be customary here on this occasion i have be talk about program program be important but even more important than program be what we be as a nation what we mean as a nation to ourselves and to the world

 in new york harbor stand one of the most famous statue in the world the statue of liberty the gift in 1886 of the people of france to the people of the united states this statue be more than a landmark it be a symbol a symbol of what america have mean to the world

 it remind we that what america have mean be not its wealth and not its power but its spirit and purpose a land that enshrine liberty and opportunity and that have hold out a hand of welcome to million in search of a well and a fuller and above all a free life

 the world 's hope pour into america along with its people and those hope those dream that have be bring here from every corner of the world have become a part of the hope that we now hold out to the world

 four year from now america will celebrate the 200th anniversary of its founding as a nation there be those who say that the old spirit of 76 be dead that we no long have the strength of character the idealism the faith in our founding purpose that that spirit represent

 those who say this do not know america

 we have be undergo self doubt and self criticism but these be only the other side of our grow sensitivity to the persistence of want in the midst of plenty of our impatience with the slowness with which age old ill be be overcome

 if we be indifferent to the shortcoming of our society or complacent about our institution or blind to the linger inequity then we would have lose our way

 but the fact that we have those concern be evidence that our ideal deep down be still strong indeed they remind we that what be really good about america be its compassion they remind we that in the final analysis america be great not because it be strong not because it be rich but because this be a good country

 let we reject the narrow vision of those who would tell we that we be evil because we be not yet perfect that we be corrupt because we be not yet pure that all the sweat and toil and sacrifice that have go into the building of america be for naught because the building be not yet do

 let we see that the path we be travel be wide with room in it for all of we and that its direction be toward a well nation and a more peaceful world

 never have it matter more that we go forward together

 look at this chamber the leadership of america be here today the supreme court the cabinet the senate the house of representatives

 together we hold the future of the nation and the conscience of the nation in our hand

 because this year be an election year it will be a time of great pressure

 if we yield to that pressure and fail to deal seriously with the historic challenge that we face we will have fail the trust of million of americans and shake the confidence they have a right to place in we in their government

 never have a congress have a great opportunity to leave a legacy of a profound and constructive reform for the nation than this congress

 if we succeed in these task there will be credit enough for all not only for do what be right but do it in the right way by rise above partisan interest to serve the national interest

 and if we fail more than any one of we america will be the loser

 that be why my call upon the congress today be for a high statesmanship so that in the year to come americans will look back and say because it withstand the intense pressure of a political year and achieve such great good for the american people and for the future of this nation this be truly a great congress



good evening
 i have ask for this television time tonight to make public a plan for peace that can end the war in vietnam
 the offer that i shall now present on behalf of the government of the united states and the government of south vietnam with the full knowledge and approval of president thieu be both generous and far reaching
 it be a plan to end the war now it include an offer to withdraw all american force within 6 month of an agreement its acceptance would mean the speedy return of all the prisoner of war to their home
 three year ago when i take office there be 550,000 americans in vietnam the number kill in action be run as high as 300 a week there be no plan to bring any americans home and the only thing that have be settle in paris be the shape of the conference table
 i immediately move to fulfill a pledge i have make to the american people to bring about a peace that could last not only for the united states but for the long suffer people of southeast asia
 there be two honorable path open to we
 the path of negotiation be and be the path we prefer but it take two to negotiate there have to be another way in case the other side refuse to negotiate
 that path we call vietnamization what it mean be train and equip the south vietnamese to defend themselves and steadily withdraw americans as they develop the capability to do so
 the path of vietnamization have be successful two week ago you will recall i announce that by may 1 american force in vietnam would be down to 69,000 that mean almost one half million americans will have be bring home from vietnam over the past 3 year in term of american life the loss of 300 a week have be reduce by over 95 percent to less than 10 a week
 but the path of vietnamization have be the long voyage home it have strain the patience and test the perseverance of the american people what of the shortcut the shortcut we prefer the path of negotiation
 progress here have be disappointing the american people deserve an accounting of why it have be disappointing tonight i intend to give you that accounting and in so do i be go to try to break the deadlock in the negotiation
 we have make a series of public proposal design to bring an end to the conflict but early in this administration after 10 month of no progress in the public paris talk i become convinced that it be necessary to explore the possibility of negotiate in private channel to see whether it would be possible to end the public deadlock
 after consultation with secretary of state rogers our ambassador in saigon and our chief negotiator in paris and with the full knowledge and approval of president thieu i send dr. kissinger to paris as my personal representative on august 4 1969 30 month ago to begin these secret peace negotiation
 since that time dr. kissinger have travel to paris 12 time on these secret mission he have meet seven time with le duc tho one of hanoi 's top political leader and minister xuan thuy head of the north vietnamese delegation to the paris talk and he have meet with minister xuan thuy five time alone i would like incidentally to take this opportunity to thank president pompidou of france for his personal assistance in help to make the arrangement for these secret talk
 this be why i initiate these private negotiation privately both side can be more flexible in offer new approach and also private discussion allow both side to talk frankly to take position free from the pressure of public debate
 in seek peace in vietnam with so many life at stake i feel we could not afford to let any opportunity go by private or public to negotiate a settlement as i have state on a number of occasion i be prepared and i remain prepared to explore any avenue public or private to speed negotiation to end the war
 for 30 month whenever secretary rogers dr. kissinger or i be ask about secret negotiation we would only say we be pursue every possible channel in our search for peace there be never a leak because we be determined not to jeopardize the secret negotiation until recently this course show sign of yield some progress
 now however it be my judgment that the purpose of peace will well be serve by bring out publicly the proposal we have be make in private
 nothing be serve by silence when the other side exploit our good faith to divide america and to avoid the conference table nothing be serve by silence when it mislead some americans into accuse their own government of fail to do what it have already do nothing be serve by silence when it enable the other side to imply possible solution publicly that it have already flatly reject privately
 the time have come to lay the record of our secret negotiation on the table just as secret negotiation can sometimes break a public deadlock public disclosure may help to break a secret deadlock
 some americans who believe what the north vietnamese lead they to believe have charge that the united states have not pursue negotiation intensively as the record that i now will disclose will show just the opposite be true
 question have be raise as to why we have not propose a deadline for the withdrawal of all american force in exchange for a cease fire and the return of our prisoner of war why we have not discuss the seven point proposal make by the vietcong last july in paris why we have not submit a new plan of our own to move the negotiation off dead center
 as the private record will show we have take all these step and more and have be flatly reject or ignore by the other side
 on may 31 1971 8 month ago at one of the secret meeting in paris we offer specifically to agree to a deadline for the withdrawal of all american force in exchange for the release of all prisoner of war and a cease fire
 at the next private meeting on june 26 the north vietnamese reject our offer they privately propose instead their own nine point plan which insist that we overthrow the government of south vietnam
 five day later on july 1 the enemy publicly present a different package of proposal the seven point vietcong plan
 that pose a dilemma which package should we respond to the public plan or the secret plan
 on july 12 at another private meeting in paris dr. kissinger put that question to the north vietnamese directly they say we should deal with their nine point secret plan because it cover all of indochina include laos and cambodia while the vietcong seven point proposal be limit to vietnam
 so that be what we do but we go even beyond that deal with some of the point in the public plan that be not cover in the secret plan
 on august 16 at another private meeting we go far we offer the complete withdrawal of u.s. and ally force within 9 month after an agreement on an overall settlement on september 13 the north vietnamese reject that proposal they continue to insist that we overthrow the south vietnamese government
 now what have be the result of these private effort for month the north vietnamese have be berate we at the public session for not respond to their side 's publicly present seven point plan
 the truth be that we do respond to the enemy 's plan in the manner they want we to respond secretly in full possession of our complete response the north vietnamese publicly denounce we for not having respond at all they induce many americans in the press and the congress into echo their propaganda americans who could not know they be be falsely use by the enemy to stir up divisiveness in this country
 i decide in october that we should make another attempt to break the deadlock i consult with president thieu who concur fully in a new plan on october 11 i send a private communication to the north vietnamese that contain new element that could move negotiation forward i urge a meeting on november 1 between dr. kissinger and special adviser le due tho or some other appropriate official from hanoi
 on october 25 the north vietnamese agree to meet and suggest november 20 as the time for a meeting on november 17 just three day before the scheduled meeting they say le duc tho be ill we offer to meet as soon as he recover either with he or immediately with any other authorize leader who could come from hanoi
 two month have pass since they call off that meeting the only reply to our plan have be an increase in troop infiltration from north vietnam and communist military offensive in laos and cambodia our proposal for peace be answer by a step up in the war on their part
 that be where matter stand today
 we be be ask publicly to respond to proposal that we answer and in some respect accept month ago in private
 we be be ask publicly to set a terminal date for our withdrawal when we already offer one in private
 and the most comprehensive peace plan of this conflict lie ignore in a secret channel while the enemy try again for military victory
 that be why i have instruct ambassador porter to present our plan publicly at this thursday 's session of the paris peace talk along with alternative to make it even more flexible
 we be publish the full detail of our plan tonight it will prove beyond doubt which side have make every effort to make these negotiation succeed it will show unmistakably that hanoi not washington or saigon have make the war go on
 here be the essence of our peace plan public disclosure may gain it the attention it deserve in hanoi
 within six month of an agreement
 we shall withdraw all u.s. and ally force from south vietnam
 we shall exchange all prisoner of war
 there shall be a cease fire throughout indochina
 there shall be a new presidential election in south vietnam
 president thieu will announce the element of this election these include international supervision and an independent body to organize and run the election represent all political force in south vietnam include the national liberation front
 furthermore president thieu have inform i that within the framework of the agreement outline above he make the follow offer he and vice president huong would be ready to resign one month before the new election the chairman of the senate as caretaker head of the government would assume administrative responsibility in south vietnam but the election would be the sole responsibility of the independent election body i have just describe
 there be several other proposal in our new peace plan for example as we offer privately on july 26 of last year we remain prepared to undertake a major re construction program throughout indochina include north vietnam to help all these people recover from the ravage of a generation of war
 we will pursue any approach that will speed negotiation
 we be ready to negotiate the plan i have outline tonight and conclude a comprehensive agreement on all military and political issue because some part of this agreement could prove more difficult to negotiate than other we would be willing to begin implement certain military aspect while negotiation continue on the implementation of other issue just as we suggest in our private proposal in october
 or as we propose last may we remain willing to settle only the military issue and leave the political issue to the vietnamese alone under this approach we would withdraw all u.s. and ally force within 6 month in exchange for an indochina cease fire and the release of all prisoner
 the choice be up to the enemy
 this be a settlement offer which be fair to north vietnam and fair to south vietnam it deserve the light of public scrutiny by these nation and by other nation throughout the world and it deserve the united support of the american people
 we make the substance of this generous offer privately over 3 month ago it have not be reject but it have be ignore i reiterate that peace offer tonight it can no long be ignore
 the only thing this plan do not do be to join our enemy to overthrow our ally which the united states of america will never do if the enemy want peace it will have to recognize the important difference between settlement and surrender
 this have be a long and agonizing struggle but it be difficult to see how anyone regardless of his past position on the war could now say that we have not go the extra mile in offer a settlement that be fair fair to everybody concern
 by the steadiness of our withdrawal of troop america have prove its resolution to end our involvement in the war by our readiness to act in the spirit of conciliation america have prove its desire to be involve in the building of a permanent peace throughout indochina
 we be ready to negotiate peace immediately
 if the enemy reject our offer to negotiate we shall continue our program of end american involvement in the war by withdraw our remain force as the south vietnamese develop the capability to defend themselves
 if the enemy 's answer to our peace offer be to step up their military attack i shall fully meet my responsibility as commander in chief of our armed forces to protect our remain troop
 we do not prefer this course of action
 we want to end the war not only for america but for all the people of indochina the plan i have propose tonight can accomplish that goal
 some of our citizen have become accustomed to think that whatever our government say must be false and whatever our enemy say must be true as far as this war be concern well the record i have reveal tonight prove the contrary we can now demonstrate publicly what we have long be demonstrate privately that america have take the initiative not only to end our participation in this war but to end the war itself for all concern
 this have be the long the most difficult war in american history
 honest and patriotic americans have disagree as to whether we should have become involved at all nine year ago and there have be disagreement on the conduct of the war the proposal i have make tonight be one on which we all can agree
 let we unite now unite in our search for peace a peace that be fair to both side a peace that can last
 thank you and good night

good evening
 five week ago on easter weekend the communist army of north vietnam launch a massive invasion of south vietnam an invasion that be make possible by tank artillery and other advanced offensive weapon supply to hanoi by the soviet union and other communist nation
 the south vietnamese have fight bravely to repel this brutal assault casualty on both side have be very high most tragically there have be over 20,000 civilian casualty include woman and child in the city which the north vietnamese have shell in wanton disregard of human life
 as i announce in my report to the nation 12 day ago the role of the united states in resist this invasion have be limit to air and naval strike on military target in north and south vietnam as i also point out in that report we have respond to north vietnam 's massive military offensive by undertake wide range new peace effort aim at end the war through negotiation
 on april 20 i send dr. kissinger to moscow for 4 day of meeting with general secretary brezhnev and other soviet leader i instruct he to emphasize our desire for a rapid solution to the war and our willingness to look at all possible approach at that time the soviet leader show an interest in bring the war to an end on a basis just to both side they urge resumption of negotiation in paris and they indicate they would use their constructive influence
 i authorize dr. kissinger to meet privately with the top north vietnamese negotiator le duc tho on tuesday may 2 in paris ambassador porter as you know resume the public peace negotiation in paris on april 27 and again on may 4 at those meeting both public and private all we hear from the enemy be bombastic rhetoric and a replaying of their demand for surrender for example at the may 2 secret meeting i authorize dr. kissinger to talk about every conceivable avenue toward peace the north vietnamese flatly refuse to consider any of these approach they refuse to offer any new approach of their own instead they simply read verbatim their previous public demand
 here be what over 3 year of public and private negotiation with hanoi have come down to the united states with the full concurrence of our south vietnamese ally have offer the maximum of what any president of the united states could offer
 we have offer a deescalation of the fighting we have offer a cease fire with a deadline for withdrawal of all american force we have offer new election which would be internationally supervise with the communists participate both in the supervisory body and in the election themselves
 president thieu have offer to resign one month before the election we have offer an exchange of prisoner of war in a ratio of 10 north vietnamese prisoner for every one american prisoner that they release and north vietnam have meet each of these offer with insolence and insult they have flatly and arrogantly refuse to negotiate an end to the war and bring peace their answer to every peace offer we have make have be to escalate the war
 in the 2 week alone since i offer to resume negotiation hanoi have launch three new military offensive in south vietnam in those 2 week the risk that a communist government may be impose on the 17 million people of south vietnam have increase and the communist offensive have now reach the point that it gravely threaten the life of 60,000 american troop who be still in vietnam
 there be only two issue leave for we in this war first in the face of a massive invasion do we stand by jeopardize the life of 60,000 americans and leave the south vietnamese to a long night of terror this will not happen we shall do whatever be require to safeguard american life and american honor
 second in the face of complete intransigence at the conference table do we join with our enemy to install a communist government in south vietnam this too will not happen we will not cross the line from generosity to treachery
 we now have a clear hard choice among three course of action immediate withdrawal of all american force continue attempt at negotiation or decisive military action to end the war
 i know that many americans favor the first course of action immediate withdrawal they believe the way to end the war be for the united states to get out and to remove the threat to our remain force by simply withdraw they
 from a political standpoint this would be a very easy choice for i to accept after all i do not send over one half million americans to vietnam i have bring 500,000 man home from vietnam since i take office but abandon our commitment in vietnam here and now would mean turn 17 million south vietnamese over to communist tyranny and terror it would mean leave hundred of american prisoner in communist hand with no bargaining leverage to get they release
 an american defeat in vietnam would encourage this kind of aggression all over the world aggression in which small nation arm by their major ally could be tempt to attack neighboring nation at will in the mideast in europe and other area world peace would be in grave jeopardy
 the second course of action be to keep on try to negotiate a settlement now this be the course we have prefer from the beginning and we shall continue to pursue it we want to negotiate but we have make every reasonable offer and try every possible path for end this war at the conference table
 the problem be as you all know it take two to negotiate and now as throughout the past four year the north vietnamese arrogantly refuse to negotiate anything but an imposition an ultimatum that the united states impose a communist regime on 17 million people in south vietnam who do not want a communist government
 it be plain then that what appear to be a choice among three course of action for the united states be really no choice at all the killing in this tragic war must stop by simply get out we would only worsen the bloodshed by rely solely on negotiation we would give an intransigent enemy the time he need to press his aggression on the battlefield
 there be only one way to stop the killing that be to keep the weapon of war out of the hand of the international outlaw of north vietnam
 throughout the war in vietnam the united states have exercise a degree of restraint unprecedented in the annal of war that be our responsibility as a great nation a nation which be interested and we can be proud of this as americans as america have always be in peace not conquest
 however when the enemy abandon all restraint throw its whole army into battle in the territory of its neighbor refuse to negotiate we simply face a new situation
 in these circumstance with 60,000 americans threaten any president who fail to act decisively would have betray the trust of his country and betray the cause of world peace
 i therefore conclude that hanoi must be deny the weapon and supply it need to continue the aggression in full coordination with the republic of vietnam i have order the follow measure which be be implement as i be speak to you
 all entrance to north vietnamese port will be mine to prevent access to these port and north vietnamese naval operation from these port united states force have be direct to take appropriate measure within the internal and claim territorial water of north vietnam to interdict the delivery of any supply rail and all other communication will be cut off to the maximum extent possible air and naval strike against military target in north vietnam will continue
 these action be not direct against any other nation country with ship presently in north vietnamese port have already be notify that their ship will have three daylight period to leave in safety after that time the mine will become active and any ship attempt to leave or enter these port will do so at their own risk
 these action i have order will cease when the follow condition be meet
 first all american prisoner of war must be return
 second there must be an internationally supervise cease fire throughout indochina
 once prisoner of war be release once the internationally supervise cease fire have begin we will stop all act of force throughout indochina and at that time we will proceed with a complete withdrawal of all american force from vietnam within four month
 now these term be generous term they be term which would not require surrender and humiliation on the part of anybody they would permit the united states to withdraw with honor they would end the killing they would bring our pow 's home they would allow negotiation on a political settlement between the vietnamese themselves they would permit all the nation which have suffer in this long war cambodia laos north vietnam south vietnam to turn at last to the urgent work of healing and of peace they deserve immediate acceptance by north vietnam
 it be appropriate to conclude my remark tonight with some comment direct individually to each of the major party involve in the continue tragedy of the vietnam war
 first to the leader of hanoi your people have already suffer too much in your pursuit of conquest do not compound their agony with continue arrogance choose instead the path of a peace that redeem your sacrifice guarantee true independence for your country and usher in an era of reconciliation
 to the people of south vietnam you shall continue to have our firm support in your resistance against aggression it be your spirit that will determine the outcome of the battle it be your will that will shape the future of your country
 to other nation especially those which be ally with north vietnam the action i have announce tonight be not direct against you their sole purpose be to protect the life of 60,000 americans who would be gravely endanger in the event that the communist offensive continue to roll forward and to prevent the imposition of a communist government by brutal aggression upon 17 million people
 i particularly direct my comment tonight to the soviet union we respect the soviet union as a great power we recognize the right of the soviet union to defend its interest when they be threaten the soviet union in turn must recognize our right to defend our interest
 no soviet soldier be threaten in vietnam sixty thousand americans be threaten we expect you to help your ally and you can not expect we to do other than to continue to help our ally but let we and let all great power help our ally only for the purpose of their defense not for the purpose of launch invasion against their neighbor
 otherwise the cause of peace the cause in which we both have so great a stake will be seriously jeopardize
 our two nation have make significant progress in our negotiation in recent month we be near major agreement on nuclear arm limitation on trade on a host of other issue
 let we not slide back toward the dark shadow of a previous age we do not ask you to sacrifice your principle or your friend but neither should you permit hanoi 's intransigence to blot out the prospect we together have so patiently prepare
 we the united states and the soviet union be on the threshold of a new relationship that can serve not only the interest of our two country but the cause of world peace we be prepared to continue to build this relationship the responsibility be yours if we fail to do so
 and finally may i say to the american people i ask you for the same strong support you have always give your president in difficult moment it be you most of all that the world will be watch
 i know how much you want to end this war i know how much you want to bring our man home and i think you know from all that i have say and do these past 3 1/2 year how much i too want to end the war to bring our man home
 you want peace i want peace but you also want honor and not defeat you want a genuine peace not a peace that be merely a prelude to another war
 at this moment we must stand together in purpose and resolve as so often in the past we americans do not choose to resort to war it have be force upon we by an enemy that have show utter contempt toward every overture we have make for peace and that be why my fellow americans tonight i ask for your support of this decision a decision which have only one purpose not to expand the war not to escalate the war but to end this war and to win the kind of peace that will last
 with god 's help with your support we will accomplish that great goal
 thank you and good night

 you know what the issue be you know that this be a choice which be probably the clear choice between the candidate for president ever present to the american people in this century
 i would however urge you to have in mind tomorrow one overriding issue and that be the issue of peace peace in vietnam and peace in the world at large for a generation to come

 there be still some detail that i be insist be work out and nail down because i want this not to be a temporary peace i want and i know you want it to be a lasting peace but i can say to you with complete confidence tonight that we will soon reach agreement on all the issue and bring this long and difficult war to an end
 you can help achieve that goal by your vote you can send a message to those with whom we be negotiate and to the leader of the world that you back the president of the united states in his insistence that we in the united states seek peace with honor and never peace with surrender
 i will not go into the other issue tonight except to say that as we move to peace we will open door to progress on many front here at home it mean that we can have something we have not have since president eisenhower be president 15 year ago prosperity without war and without inflation
 it mean we can have progress toward well education well health in all the area that i have present to the american people over these past four year

good evening my fellow americans
 before go over to the shoreham hotel to address the victory celebration which be in process there i want to take a moment to say a word to all of you in this very personal way speak from the oval office
 i first want to express my deep appreciation to every one of you the million of you who give i your support in the election today and i want to express my respect for million of other who give their support to senator mcgovern i know that after a campaign when one lose he can feel very very low and his supporter as well may feel that way and when he win as you will note when i get over to the shoreham people be feel very much well
 the important thing in our process however be to play the game and in the great game of life and particularly the game of politic what be important be that on either side more americans vote this year than ever before and the fact that you win or you lose must not keep you from keep in the great game of politic in the year ahead because the well competition we have between the two party between the two man run for office whatever office that may be mean that we get the well people and the well program for our country
 now that the election be over it be time to get on with the great task that lie before we i have try to conduct myself in this campaign in a way that would not divide our country not divide it regionally or by party or in any other way because i very firmly believe that what unite america today be infinitely more important than those thing which divide we we be united americans north east west and south both party in our desire for peace peace with honor the kind of a peace that will last and we be move swiftly toward that great goal not just in vietnam but a new era of peace in which the old relationship between the two super power the soviet union and the united states and between the world 's most populous nation the people 's republic of china and the united states be change so that we be on the eve of what could be the great generation of peace true peace for the whole world that man have ever know
 this be a great goal big than whether we be democrats or republicans and it be one that i think you will want to work with i with all of we in help to achieve
 there be other goal that go with that the prosperity without war and without inflation that we have all want and that we now can have and the progress for all americans the kind of progress so that we can say to any young american whatever his background that he or she in this great country have an equal chance to go to the top in whatever field he or she may choose
 i have note in listen to the return a few minute ago that several commentator have reflect on the fact that this may be one of the great political victory of all time in term of vote that may be true but in term of what a victory really be a huge landslide margin mean nothing at all unless it be a victory for america it will be a victory for america only if in these next four year we all of we can work together to achieve our common great goal of peace at home and peace for all nation in the world and for that new progress and prosperity which all americans deserve
 i would only hope that in these next four year we can so conduct ourselves in this country and so meet our responsibility in the world in build peace in the world that year from now people will look back to the generation of the 1970 at how we have conduct ourselves and they will say god bless america
 thank you very much

mr. vice president mr. speaker mr. chief justice senator cook mrs. eisenhower and my fellow citizen of this great and good country we share together
 when we meet here four year ago america be bleak in spirit depress by the prospect of seemingly endless war abroad and of destructive conflict at home
 as we meet here today we stand on the threshold of a new era of peace in the world
 the central question before we be how shall we use that peace let we resolve that this era we be about to enter will not be what other postwar period have so often be a time of retreat and isolation that lead to stagnation at home and invite new danger abroad
 let we resolve that this will be what it can become a time of great responsibility greatly bear in which we renew the spirit and the promise of america as we enter our third century as a nation
 this past year see far reach result from our new policy for peace by continue to revitalize our traditional friendship and by our mission to peking and to moscow we be able to establish the base for a new and more durable pattern of relationship among the nation of the world because of america 's bold initiative 1972 will be long remember as the year of the great progress since the end of world war ii toward a last peace in the world
 the peace we seek in the world be not the flimsy peace which be merely an interlude between war but a peace which can endure for generation to come
 it be important that we understand both the necessity and the limitation of america 's role in maintain that peace
 unless we in america work to preserve the peace there will be no peace
 unless we in america work to preserve freedom there will be no freedom
 but let we clearly understand the new nature of america 's role as a result of the new policy we have adopt over these past four year
 we shall respect our treaty commitment
 we shall support vigorously the principle that no country have the right to impose its will or rule on another by force
 we shall continue in this era of negotiation to work for the limitation of nuclear arm and to reduce the danger of confrontation between the great power
 we shall do our share in defend peace and freedom in the world but we shall expect other to do their share
 the time have pass when america will make every other nation 's conflict our own or make every other nation 's future our responsibility or presume to tell the people of other nation how to manage their own affair
 just as we respect the right of each nation to determine its own future we also recognize the responsibility of each nation to secure its own future
 just as america 's role be indispensable in preserve the world 's peace so be each nation 's role indispensable in preserve its own peace
 together with the rest of the world let we resolve to move forward from the beginning we have make let we continue to bring down the wall of hostility which have divide the world for too long and to build in their place bridge of understanding so that despite profound difference between system of government the people of the world can be friend
 let we build a structure of peace in the world in which the weak be as safe as the strong in which each respect the right of the other to live by a different system in which those who would influence other will do so by the strength of their idea and not by the force of their arm
 let we accept that high responsibility not as a burden but gladly gladly because the chance to build such a peace be the noble endeavor in which a nation can engage gladly also because only if we act greatly in meet our responsibility abroad will we remain a great nation and only if we remain a great nation will we act greatly in meet our challenge at home
 we have the chance today to do more than ever before in our history to make life well in america to ensure well education well health well housing well transportation a clean environment to restore respect for law to make our community more livable and to insure the god give right of every american to full and equal opportunity
 because the range of our need be so great because the reach of our opportunity be so great let we be bold in our determination to meet those need in new way
 just as build a structure of peace abroad have require turn away from old policy that fail so build a new era of progress at home require turn away from old policy that have fail
 abroad the shift from old policy to new have not be a retreat from our responsibility but a well way to peace
 and at home the shift from old policy to new will not be a retreat from our responsibility but a well way to progress
 abroad and at home the key to those new responsibility lie in the placing and the division of responsibility we have live too long with the consequence of attempt to gather all power and responsibility in washington
 abroad and at home the time have come to turn away from the condescend policy of paternalism of washington know well
 a person can be expect to act responsibly only if he have responsibility this be human nature so let we encourage individual at home and nation abroad to do more for themselves to decide more for themselves let we locate responsibility in more place let we measure what we will do for other by what they will do for themselves
 that be why today i offer no promise of a purely governmental solution for every problem we have live too long with that false promise in trust too much in government we have ask of it more than it can deliver this lead only to inflated expectation to reduce individual effort and to a disappointment and frustration that erode confidence both in what government can do and in hat people can do
 government must learn to take less from people so that people an do more for themselves
 let we remember that america be build not by government but by people not by welfare but by work not by shirk responsibility but by seek responsibility
 in our own life let each of we ask not just what will government do for i but what can i do for myself
 in the challenge we face together let each of we ask not just how can government help but how can i help
 your national government have a great and vital role to play and i pledge to you that where this government should act we will act boldly and we will lead boldly but just as important be the role that each and every one of we must play as an individual and as a member of his own community
 from this day forward let each of we make a solemn commitment in his own heart to bear his responsibility to do his part to live his ideal so that together we can see the dawn of a new age of progress for america and together as we celebrate our 200th anniversary as a nation we can do so proud in the fulfillment of our promise to ourselves and to the world
 as america 's long and most difficult war come to an end let we again learn to debate our difference with civility and decency and let each of we reach out for that one precious quality government can not provide a new level of respect for the right and feeling of one another a new level of respect for the individual human dignity which be the cherished birthright of every american
 above all else the time have come for we to renew our faith in ourselves and in america
 in recent year that faith have be challenge
 our child have be teach to be ashamed of their country ashamed of their parent ashamed of america 's record at home and of its role in the world
 at every turn we have be beset by those who find everything wrong with america and little that be right but i be confident that this will not be the judgment of history on these remarkable time in which we be privileged to live
 america 's record in this century have be unparalleled in the world 's history for its responsibility for its generosity for its creativity and for its progress
 let we be proud that our system have produce and provide more freedom and more abundance more widely share than any other system in the history of the world
 let we be proud that in each of the four war in which we have be engage in this century include the one we be now bring to an end we have fight not for our selfish advantage but to help other resist aggression
 let we be proud that by our bold new initiative and by our steadfastness for peace with honor we have make a break through toward create in the world what the world have not know before a structure of peace that can last not merely for our time but for generation to come
 we be embark here today on an era that present challenge great as those any nation or any generation have ever face
 we shall answer to god to history and to our conscience for the way in which we use these year
 as i stand in this place so hallowed by history i think of other who have stand here before i i think of the dream they have for america and i think of how each recognize that he need help far beyond himself in order to make those dream come true
 today i ask your prayer that in the year ahead i may have god 's help in make decision that be right for america and i pray for your help so that together we may be worthy of our challenge
 let we pledge together to make these next four year the good four year in america 's history so that on its 200th birthday america will be as young and as vital as when it begin and as bright a beacon of hope for all the world
 let we go forward from here confident in hope strong in our faith in one another sustain by our faith in god who create we and strive always to serve his purpose

good evening
 i want to talk to you tonight from my heart on a subject of deep concern to every american
 in recent month member of my administration and official of the committee for the re election of the president include some of my close friend and most trusted aide have be charge with involvement in what have come to be know as the watergate affair these include charge of illegal activity during and precede the 1972 presidential election and charge that responsible official participate in effort to cover up that illegal activity
 the inevitable result of these charge have be to raise serious question about the integrity of the white house itself tonight i wish to address those question
 last june 17 while i be in florida try to get a few day rest after my visit to moscow i first learn from news report of the watergate break in i be appal at this senseless illegal action and i be shocked to learn that employee of the re election committee be apparently among those guilty i immediately order an investigation by appropriate government authority on september 15 as you will recall indictment be bring against seven defendant in the case
 as the investigation go forward i repeatedly ask those conduct the investigation whether there be any reason to believe that member of my administration be in any way involve i receive repeat assurance that there be not because of these continue reassurance because i believe the report i be get because i have faith in the person from whom i be get they i discount the story in the press that appear to implicate member of my administration or other official of the campaign committee
 until march of this year i remain convinced that the denial be true and that the charge of involvement by member of the white house staff be false the comment i make during this period and the comment make by my press secretary in my behalf be base on the information provide to we at the time we make those comment however new information then come to i which persuade i that there be a real possibility that some of these charge be true and suggest far that there have be an effort to conceal the fact both from the public from you and from i
 as a result on march 21 i personally assume the responsibility for coordinate intensive new inquiry into the matter and i personally order those conduct the investigation to get all the fact and to report they directly to i right here in this office
 i again order that all person in the government or at the re election committee should cooperate fully with the fbi the prosecutor and the grand jury i also order that anyone who refuse to cooperate in tell the truth would be ask to resign from government service and with ground rule adopt that would preserve the basic constitutional separation of power between the congress and the presidency i direct that member of the white house staff should appear and testify voluntarily under oath before the senate committee which be investigate watergate
 i be determined that we should get to the bottom of the matter and that the truth should be fully bring out no matter who be involve
 at the same time i be determined not to take precipitate action and to avoid if at all possible any action that would appear to reflect on innocent people i want to be fair but i know that in the final analysis the integrity of this office public faith in the integrity of this office would have to take priority over all personal consideration
 today in one of the most difficult decision of my presidency i accept the resignation of two of my close associate in the white house bob haldeman john ehrlichman two of the fine public servant it have be my privilege to know
 i want to stress that in accept these resignation i mean to leave no implication whatever of personal wrongdoing on their part and i leave no implication tonight of implication on the part of other who have be charge in this matter but in matter as sensitive as guard the integrity of our democratic process it be essential not only that rigorous legal and ethical standard be observe but also that the public you have total confidence that they be both be observe and enforce by those in authority and particularly by the president of the united states they agree with i that this move be necessary in order to restore that confidence
 because attorney general kleindienst though a distinguished public servant my personal friend for 20 year with no personal involvement whatever in this matter have be a close personal and professional associate of some of those who be involve in this case he and i both feel that it be also necessary to name a new attorney general
 the counsel to the president john dean have also resign
 as the new attorney general i have today name elliot richardson a man of unimpeachable integrity and rigorously high principle i have direct he to do everything necessary to ensure that the department of justice have the confidence and the trust of every law abide person in this country
 i have give he absolute authority to make all decision bear upon the prosecution of the watergate case and related matter i have instruct he that if he should consider it appropriate he have the authority to name a special supervising prosecutor for matter arise out of the case
 whatever may appear to have be the case before whatever improper activity may yet be discover in connection with this whole sordid affair i want the american people i want you to know beyond the shadow of a doubt that during my term as president justice will be pursue fairly fully and impartially no matter who be involve this office be a sacred trust and i be determined to be worthy of that trust
 look back at the history of this case two question arise
 how could it have happen
 who be to blame
 political commentator have correctly observe that during my 27 year in politic i have always previously insist on run my own campaign for office
 but 1972 present a very different situation in both domestic and foreign policy 1972 be a year of crucially important decision of intense negotiation of vital new direction particularly in work toward the goal which have be my override concern throughout my political career the goal of bring peace to america peace to the world
 that be why i decide as the 1972 campaign approach that the presidency should come first and politic second to the maximum extent possible therefore i seek to delegate campaign operation to remove the day to day campaign decision from the president 's office and from the white house i also as you recall severely limit the number of my own campaign appearance
 who then be to blame for what happen in this case
 for specific criminal action by specific individual those who commit those action must of course bear the liability and pay the penalty
 for the fact that allege improper action take place within the white house or within my campaign organization the easy course would be for i to blame those to whom i delegate the responsibility to run the campaign but that would be a cowardly thing to do
 i will not place the blame on subordinate on people whose zeal exceed their judgment and who may have do wrong in a cause they deeply believe to be right
 in any organization the man at the top must bear the responsibility that responsibility therefore belong here in this office i accept it and i pledge to you tonight from this office that i will do everything in my power to ensure that the guilty be bring to justice and that such abuse be purge from our political process in the year to come long after i have leave this office
 some people quite properly appal at the abuse that occur will say that watergate demonstrate the bankruptcy of the american political system i believe precisely the opposite be true watergate represent a series of illegal act and bad judgment by a number of individual it be the system that have bring the fact to light and that will bring those guilty to justice a system that in this case have include a determined grand jury honest prosecutor a courageous judge john sirica and a vigorous free press
 it be essential now that we place our faith in that system and especially in the judicial system it .is essential that we let the judicial process go forward respect those safeguard that be establish to protect the innocent as well as to convict the guilty it be essential that in react to the excess of other we not fall into excess ourselves
 it be also essential that we not be so distracted by event such as this that we neglect the vital work before we before this nation before america at a time of critical importance to america and the world
 since march when i first learn that the watergate affair might in fact be far more serious than i have be lead to believe it have claim far too much of my time and my attention
 whatever may now transpire in the case whatever the action of the grand jury whatever the outcome of any eventual trial i must now turn my full attention and i shall do so once again to the large duty of this office i owe it to this great office that i hold and i owe it to you to my country
 i know that as attorney general elliot richardson will be both fair and he will be fearless in pursue this case wherever it lead i be confident that with he in charge justice will be do
 there be vital work to be do toward our goal of a lasting structure of peace in the world work that can not wait work that i must do
 tomorrow for example chancellor brandt of west germany will visit the white house for talk that be a vital element of the year of europe as 1973 have be call we be already prepare for the next soviet american summit meeting later this year
 this be also a year in which we be seek to negotiate a mutual and balanced reduction of armed force in europe which will reduce our defense budget and allow we to have fund for other purpose at home so desperately need it be the year when the united states and soviet negotiator will seek to work out the second and even more important round of our talk on limit nuclear arm and of reduce the danger of a nuclear war that would destroy civilization as we know it it be a year in which we confront the difficult task of maintain peace in southeast asia and in the potentially explosive middle east
 there be also vital work to be do right here in america to ensure prosperity and that mean a good job for everyone who want to work to control inflation that i know worry every housewife everyone who try to balance a family budget in america to set in motion new and well way of ensure progress toward a well life for all americans
 when i think of this office of what it mean i think of all the thing that i want to accomplish for this nation of all the thing i want to accomplish for you
 on christmas eve during my terrible personal ordeal of the renew bombing of north vietnam which after 12 year of war finally help to bring america peace with honor i sit down just before midnight i write out some of my goal for my second term as president let i read they to you
 to make it possible for our child and for our child 's child to live in a world of peace
 to make this country be more than ever a land of opportunity of equal opportunity full opportunity for every american
 to provide job for all who can work and generous help for those who can not work
 to establish a climate of decency and civility in which each person respect the feeling and the dignity and the godgiven right of his neighbor
 to make this a land in which each person can dare to dream can live his dream not in fear but in hope proud of his community proud of his country proud of what america have mean to himself and to the world
 these be great goal i believe we can we must work for they we can achieve they but we can not achieve these goal unless we dedicate ourselves to another goal
 we must maintain the integrity of the white house and that integrity must be real not transparent there can be no whitewash at the white house
 we must reform our political process rid it not only of the violation of the law but also of the ugly mob violence and other inexcusable campaign tactic that have be too often practice and too readily accept in the past include those that may have be a response by one side to the excess or expect excess of the other side two wrong do not make a right
 i have be in public life for more than a quarter of a century like any other calling politic have good people and bad people and let i tell you the great majority in politic in the congress in the federal government in the state government be good people i know that it can be very easy under the intensive pressure of a campaign for even well intentione people to fall into shady tactic to rationalize this on the ground that what be at stake be of such importance to the nation that the end justify the mean and both of our great party have be guilty of such tactic in the past
 in recent year however the campaign excess that have occur on all side have provide a sobering demonstration of how far this false doctrine can take we the lesson be clear america in its political campaign must not again fall into the trap of let the end however great that end be justify the mean
 i urge the leader of both political party i urge citizen all of you everywhere to join in work toward a new set of standard new rule and procedure to ensure that future election will be as nearly free of such abuse as they possibly can be make this be my goal i ask you to join in make it america 's goal
 when i be inaugurate for a second time this past january 20 i give each member of my cabinet and each member of my senior white house staff a special 4 year calendar with each day mark to show the number of day remain to the administration in the inscription on each calendar i write these word the presidential term which begin today consist of 1,461 day no more no less each can be a day of strengthening and renewal for america each can add depth and dimension to the american experience if we strive together if we make the most of the challenge and the opportunity that these day offer we they can stand out as great day for america and great moment in the history of the world
 i look at my own calendar this morning up at camp david as i be work on this speech it show exactly 1,361 day remain in my term i want these to be the good day in america 's history because i love america i deeply believe that america be the hope of the world and i know that in the quality and wisdom of the leadership america give lie the only hope for million of people all over the world that they can live their life in peace and freedom we must be worthy of that hope in every sense of the word tonight i ask for your prayer to help i in everything that i do throughout the day of my presidency to be worthy of their hope and of your
 god bless america and god bless each and every one of you

good evening
 now that most of the major witness in the watergate phase of the senate committee hearing on campaign practice have be hear the time have come for i to speak out about the charge make and to provide a perspective on the issue for the american people
 for over four month watergate have dominate the news medium during the past three month the three major network have devote an average of over 22 hour of television time each week to this subject the senate committee have hear over 2 million word of testimony
 this investigation begin as an effort to discover the fact about the break in and bugging of the democratic national headquarters and other campaign abuse
 but as the week have go by it have become clear that both the hearing themselves and some of the commentary on they have become increasingly absorb in an effort to implicate the president personally in the illegal activity that take place
 because the abuse occur during my administration and in the campaign for my reelection i accept full responsibility for they i regret that these event take place and i do not question the right of a senate committee to investigate charge make against the president to the extent that this be relevant to legislative duty
 however it be my constitutional responsibility to defend the integrity of this great office against false charge i also believe that it be important to address the override question of what we as a nation can learn from this experience and what we should now do i intend to discuss both of these subject tonight
 the record of the senate hearing be lengthy the fact be complicated the evidence conflicting it would not be right for i to try to sort out the evidence to rebut specific witness or to pronounce my own judgment about their credibility that be for the committee and for the court
 i shall not attempt to deal tonight with the various charge in detail rather i shall attempt to put the event in perspective from the standpoint of the presidency
 on may 22 before the major witness have testify i issue a detailed statement address the charge that have be make against the president
 i have today issue another write statement which address the charge that have be make since then as they relate to my own conduct and which describe the effort that i make to discover the fact about the matter
 on may 22 i state in very specific term and i state again to every one of you listen tonight these fact i have no prior knowledge of the watergate break in i neither take part in nor know about any of the subsequent coverup activity i neither authorize nor encourage subordinate to engage in illegal or improper campaign tactic that be and that be the simple truth in all of the million of word of testimony there be not the slight suggestion that i have any knowledge of the planning for the watergate break in as for the coverup my statement have be challenge by only one of the 35 witness who appear a witness who offer no evidence beyond his own impression and whose testimony have be contradict by every other witness in a position to know the fact
 tonight let i explain to you what i do about watergate after the break in occur so that you can well understand the fact that i also have no knowledge of the so call coverup
 from the time when the break in occur i press repeatedly to know the fact and particularly whether there be any involvement of anyone in the white house i consider two thing essential
 first that the investigation should be thorough and aboveboard and second that if there be any high involvement we should get the fact out first as i say at my august 29 press conference last year what really hurt in matter of this sort be not the fact that they occur because over zealous people in campaign do thing that be wrong what really hurt be if you try to cover it up i believe that then and certainly the experience of this last year have prove that to be true
 i know that the justice department and the fbi be conduct intensive investigation as i have insist that they should the white house counsel john dean be assign to monitor these investigation and particularly to check into any possible white house involvement throughout the summer of 1972 i continue to press the question and i continue to get the same answer i be tell again and again that there be no indication that any person be involve other than the seven who be know to have plan and carry out the operation and who be subsequently indict and convict
 on september 12 at a meeting that i hold with the cabinet the senior white house staff and a number of legislative leader attorney general kleindienst report on the investigation he tell we it have be the most extensive investigation since the assassination of president kennedy and that it have establish that only those seven be involve
 on september 15 the day the seven be indict i meet with john dean the white house counsel he give i no reason whatever to believe that any other be guilty i assume that the indictment of only the seven by the grand jury confirm the report he have be give to that effect throughout the summer
 on february 16 i meet with acting director gray prior to submit his name to the senate for confirmation as permanent director of the fbi i stress to he that he would be question closely about the fbi 's conduct of the watergate investigation i ask he if he still have full confidence in it he reply that he do that he be proud of its thoroughness and that he could defend it with enthusiasm before the committee
 because i trust the agency conduct the investigation because i believe the report i be get i do not believe the newspaper account that suggest a coverup i be convinced there be no coverup because i be convince that no one have anything to cover up
 it be not until march 21 of this year that i receive new information from the white house counsel that lead i to conclude that the report i have be get for over 9 month be not true on that day i launch an intensive effort of my own to get the fact and to get the fact out whatever the fact might be i want the white house to be the first to make they public
 at first i entrust the task of get i the fact to mr. dean when after spend a week at camp david he fail to produce the write report i have ask for i turn to john ehrlichman and to the attorney general while also make independent inquiry of my own by mid april i have receive mr. ehrlichman 's report and also one from the attorney general base on new information uncover by the justice department these report make it clear to i that the situation be far more serious than i have imagine it at once become evident to i that the responsibility for the investigation in the case should be give to the criminal division of the justice department
 i turn over all the information i have to the head of that department assistant attorney general henry petersen a career government employee with an impeccable nonpartisan record and i instruct he to pursue the matter thoroughly i order all member of the administration to testify fully before the grand jury
 and with my concurrence on may 18 attorney general richardson appoint a special prosecutor to handle the matter and the case be now before the grand jury
 far from try to hide the fact my effort throughout have be to discover the fact and to lay those fact before the appropriate law enforcement authority so that justice could be do and the guilty deal with
 i rely on the good law enforcement agency in the country to find and report the truth i believe they have do so just as they believe they have do so
 many have urge that in order to help prove the truth of what i have say i should turn over to the special prosecutor and the senate committee recording of conversation that i hold in my office or on my telephone
 however a much more important principle be involve in this question than what the tape might prove about watergate
 each day a president of the united states be require to make difficult decision on grave issue it be absolutely necessary if the president be to be able to do his job as the country expect that he be able to talk openly and candidly with his adviser about issue and individual this kind of frank discussion be only possible when those who take part in it know that what they say be in strictest confidence
 the presidency be not the only office that require confidentiality a member of congress must be able to talk in confidence with his assistant judge must be able to confer in confidence with their law clerk and with each other for very good reason no branch of government have ever compel disclosure of confidential conversation between officer of other branch of government and their adviser about government business would want to talk frankly about the congressional horse trading that might get a vital bill pass no one would want to speak bluntly about public figure here and abroad
 that be why i shall continue to oppose effort which would set a precedent that would cripple all future president by inhibit conversation between they and those they look to for advice
 this principle of confidentiality of presidential conversation be at stake in the question of these tape i must and i shall oppose any effort to destroy this principle which be so vital to the conduct of this great office
 turn now to the basic issue which have be raise by watergate i recognize that merely answer the charge that have be make against the president be not enough the word watergate have come to represent a much broad set of concern
 to most of we watergate have come to mean not just a burglary and bugging of party headquarters but a whole series of act that either represent or appear to represent an abuse of trust it have come to stand for excessive partisanship for enemy list for effort to use the great institution of government for partisan political purpose
 for many americans the term watergate also have come to include a number of national security matter that have be bring into the investigation such as those involve in my effort to stop massive leak of vital diplomatic and military secret and to counter the wave of bombing and burning and other violent assault of just a few year ago
 let i speak first of the political abuse
 i know from long experience that a political campaign be always a hard and a tough contest a candidate for high office have an obligation to his party to his supporter and to the cause he represent he must always put forth his good effort to win but he also have an obligation to the country to conduct that contest within the law and within the limit of decency
 no political campaign ever justify obstruct justice or harass individual or compromise those great agency of government that should and must be above politic to the extent that these thing be do in the 1972 campaign they be serious abuse and i deplore they
 practice of that kind do not represent what i believe government should be or what i believe politic should be in a free society the institution of government belong to the people they must never be use against the people
 and in the future my administration will be more vigilant in ensure that such abuse do not take place and that official at every level understand that they be not to take place
 and i reject the cynical view that politics be inevitably or even usually a dirty business let we not allow what a few overzealous people do in watergate to tar the reputation of the million of dedicated americans of both party who fight hard but clean for the candidate of their choice in 1972 by their unselfish effort these people make our system work and they keep america free
 i pledge to you tonight that i will do all that i can to ensure that one of the result of watergate be a new level of political decency and integrity in america in which what have be wrong in our politic no long corrupt or demean what be right in our politic
 let i turn now to the difficult question that arise in protect the national security
 it be important to recognize that these be difficult question and that reasonable and patriotic man and woman may differ on how they should be answer
 only last year the supreme court say that implicit in the president 's constitutional duty be the power to protect our government against those who would subvert or overthrow it by unlawful mean how to carry out this duty be often a delicate question to which there be no easy answer
 for example every president since world war ii have believe that in internal security matter the president have the power to authorize wiretap without first obtain a search warrant
 an act of congress in 1968 have seem to recognize such power last year the supreme court hold to the contrary and my administration be of course now comply with that supreme court decision but until the supreme court speak i have be act as do my predecessor president truman president eisenhower president kennedy and president johnson in a reasonable belief that in certain circumstance the constitution permit and sometimes even require such measure to protect the national security in the public interest
 although it be the president 's duty to protect the security of the country we of course must be extremely careful in the way we go about this for if we lose our liberty we will have little use for security instance have now come to light in which a zeal for security do go too far and do interfere impermissibly with individual liberty it be essential that such mistake not be repeat but it be also essential that we do not overreact to particular mistake by tie the president 's hand in a way that would risk sacrifice our security and with it all our liberty
 i shall continue to meet my constitutional responsibility to protect the security of this nation so that americans may enjoy their freedom but i shall and can do so by constitutional mean in way that will not threaten that freedom
 as we look at watergate in a long perspective we can see that its abuse result from the assumption by those involve that their cause place they beyond the reach of those rule that apply to other person and that hold a free society together
 that attitude can never be tolerate in our country however it do not suddenly develop in the year 1972 it become fashionable in the 1960 's as individual and group increasingly assert the right to take the law into their own hand insist that their purpose represent a high morality then their attitude be praise in the press and even from some of our pulpit as evidence of a new idealism those of we who insist on the old restraint who warn of the override importance of operate within the law and by the rule be accuse of be reactionary
 that same attitude bring a rise spiral of violence and fear of riot and arson and bombing all in the name of peace and in the name of justice political discussion turn into savage debate free speech be brutally suppress as heckler shout down or even physically assault those with whom they disagree serious people raise serious question about whether we could survive as a free democracy
 the notion that the end justify the mean prove contagious thus it be not surprising even though it be deplorable that some person in 1972 adopt the morality that they themselves have rightly condemn and committed act that have no place in our political system
 those act can not be defend those who be guilty of abuse must be punish but ultimately the answer do not lie merely in the jailing of a few overzealous person who mistakenly think their cause justify their violation of the law
 rather it lie in a commitment by all of we to show a renew respect for the mutual restraint that be the mark of a free and a civilized society it require that we learn once again to work together if not unite in all of our purpose then at least unite in respect for the system by which our conflict be peacefully resolve and our liberty maintain
 if there be law we disagree with let we work to change they but let we obey they until they be change if we have disagreement over government policy let we work those out in a decent and civilized way within the law and with respect for our difference
 we must recognize that one excess beget another and that the extreme of violence and discord in the 1960 's contribute to the extreme of watergate
 both be wrong both should be condemn no individual no group and no political party have a corner on the market on morality in america
 if we learn the important lesson of watergate if we do what be necessary to prevent such abuse in the future on both side we can emerge from this experience a well and a strong nation
 let i turn now to an issue that be important above all else and that be critically affect your life today and will affect your life and your child 's life in the year to come
 after 12 week and two million word of televise testimony we have reach a point at which a continued backward look obsession with watergate be cause this nation to neglect matter of far great importance to all of the american people
 we must not stay so mired in watergate that we fail to respond to challenge of surpass importance to america and the world we can not let an obsession with the past destroy our hope for the future
 legislation vital to your health and well being sit unattended on the congressional calendar confidence at home and abroad in our economy our currency our foreign policy be be sap by uncertainty critical negotiation be take place on strategic weapon and on troop level in europe that can affect the security of this nation and the peace of the world long after watergate be forget vital event be take place in southeast asia which could lead to a tragedy for the cause of peace
 these be matter that can not wait they cry out for action now and either we your elect representative here in washington ought to get on with the job that need to be do for you or every one of you ought to be demand to know why
 the time have come to turn watergate over to the court where the question of guilt or innocence belong the time have come for the rest of we to get on with the urgent business of our nation
 last november the american people be give the clear choice of this century your vote be a mandate which i accept to complete the initiative we begin in my first term and to fulfill the promise i make for my second term
 this administration be elect to control inflation to reduce the power and size of government to cut the cost of government so that you can cut the cost of living to preserve and defend those fundamental value that have make america great to keep the nation 's military strength second to none to achieve peace with honor in southeast asia and to bring home our prisoner of war to build a new prosperity without inflation and without war to create a structure of peace in the world that would endure long after we be go
 these be great goal they be worthy of a great people and i would not be true to your trust if i let myself be turn aside from achieve those goal
 if you share my belief in these goal if you want the mandate you give this administration to be carry out then i ask for your help to ensure that those who would exploit watergate in order to keep we from do what we be elect to do will not succeed
 i ask tonight for your understanding so that as a nation we can learn the lesson of watergate and gain from that experience
 i ask for your help in reaffirm our dedication to the principle of decency honor and respect for the institution that have sustain our progress through these past two century
 and i ask for your support in get on once again with meet your problem improve your life build your future
 with your help with god 's help we will achieve those great goal for america
 thank you and good evening

 tonight for the first time in 12 year a president of the united states can report to the congress on the state of a union at peace with every nation of the world because of this in the 22,000 word message on the state of the union that i have just hand to the speaker of the house and the president of the senate i have be able to deal primarily with the problem of peace with what we can do here at home in america for the american people rather than with the problem of war
 the measure i have outline in this message set an agenda for truly significant progress for this nation and the world in 1974 before we chart where we be go let we see how far we have come
 it be five year ago on the step of this capitol that i take the oath of office as your president in those five year because of the initiative undertake by this administration the world have change america have change as a result of those change america be safe today more prosperous today with great opportunity for more of its people than ever before in our history
 five year ago america be at war in southeast asia we be lock in confrontation with the soviet union we be in hostile isolation from a quarter of the world 's people who live in mainland china
 five year ago our city be burn and besiege
 five year ago our college campus be a battleground
 five year ago crime be increase at a rate that strike fear across the nation
 five year ago the spiral rise in drug addiction be threaten human and social tragedy of massive proportion and there be no program to deal with it
 five year ago as young americans bad do for a generation before that america 's youth still live under the shadow of the military draft
 five year ago there be no national program to preserve our environment day by day our air be get dirty our water be get more foul
 and five year ago american agriculture be practically a depressed industry with 100,000 farm family abandon the farm every year
 as we look at america today we find ourselves challenge by new problem but we also find a record of progress to confound the professional crier of doom and prophet of despair we meet the challenge we face five year ago and we will be equally confident of meet those that we face today
 let we see for a moment how we have meet they
 after more than 10 year of military involvement all of our troop have return from southeast asia and they have return with honor and we can be proud of the fact that our courageous prisoner of war for whom a dinner be hold in washington tonight that they come home with their head high on their foot and not on their knee
 in our relation with the soviet union we have turn away from a policy of confrontation to one of negotiation for the first time since world war ii the world 's two strong power be work together toward peace in the world with the people 's republic of china after a generation of hostile isolation we have begin a period of peaceful exchange and expand trade
 peace have return to our city to our campus the 17 year rise in crime have be stop we can confidently say today that we be finally begin to win the war against crime right here in this nation 's capital which a few year ago be threaten to become the crime capital of the world the rate in crime have be cut in half a massive campaign against drug abuse have be organize and the rate of new heroin addiction the most vicious threat of all be decrease rather than increase
 for the first time in a generation no young americans be be draft into the armed service of the united states and for the first time ever we have organize a massive national effort to protect the environment our air be get clean our water be get purer and our agriculture which be depressed be prosper farm income be up 70 percent farm production be set all time record and the billion of dollar the taxpayer be pay in subsidy have be cut to nearly zero
 overall americans be live more abundantly than ever before today more than two and a half million new job be create in the past year alone that be the big percentage increase in nearly 20 year people be earn more what they earn buy more more than ever before in history in the past five year the average american 's real spendable income that be what you really can buy with your income even after allow for taxis and inflation have increase by 16 percent
 despite this record of achievement as we turn to the year ahead we hear once again the familiar voice of the perennial prophet of gloom tell we now that because of the need to fight inflation because of the energy shortage america may be head for a recession
 let i speak to that issue head on there will be no recession in the united states of america primarily due to our energy crisis our economy be pass through a difficult period but i pledge to you tonight that the full power of this government will be use to keep america 's economy produce and to protect the job of america 's worker
 we be engage in a long and hard fight against inflation there have be and there will be in the future up and down in that fight but if this congress cooperate in our effort to hold down the cost of government we shall win our fight to hold down the cost of live for the american people
 as we look back over our history the year that stand out as the one of signal achievement be those in which the administration and the congress whether one party or the other work together have the wisdom and the foresight to select those particular initiative for which the nation be ready and the moment be right and in which they seize the moment and act
 look at the year 1974 which lie before we there be ten key area in which landmark accomplishment be possible this year in america if we make these our national agenda this be what we will achieve in 1974
 we will break the back of the energy crisis we will lay the foundation for our future capacity to meet america 's energy need from america 's own resource
 and we will take another giant stride toward last peace in the world not only by continue our policy of negotiation rather than confrontation where the great power be concern but also by help toward the achievement of a just and last settlement in the middle east
 we will check the rise in price without administer the harsh medicine of recession and we will move the economy into a steady period of growth at a sustainable level
 we will establish a new system that make high quality health care available to every american in a dignified manner and at a price he can afford
 we will make our state and locality more responsive to the need of their own citizen
 we will make a crucial breakthrough toward well transportation in our town and in our city across america
 we will reform our system of federal aid to education to provide it when it be need where it be need so that it will do the most for those who need it the most
 we will make an historic beginning on the task of define and protect the right of personal privacy for every american
 and we will start on a new road toward reform of a welfare system that bleed the taxpayer corrode the community and demean those it be intend to assist
 and together with the other nation of the world we will establish the economic framework within which americans will share more fully in an expand worldwide trade and prosperity in the year ahead with more open access to both market and supply
 in all of the 186 state of the union message deliver from this place in our history this be the first in which the one priority the first priority be energy let i begin by report a new development which i know will be welcome news to every american as you know we have commit ourselves to an active role in help to achieve a just and durable peace in the middle east on the basis of full implementation of security council resolutions 242 and 338 the first step in the process be the disengagement of egyptian and israeli force which be now take place
 because of this hopeful development i can announce tonight that i have be assure through my personal contact with friendly leader in the middle eastern area that an urgent meeting will be call in the immediate future to discuss the lifting of the oil embargo
 this be an encouraging sign however it should be clearly understand by our friend in the middle east that the united states will not be coerce on this issue
 regardless of the outcome of this meeting the cooperation of the american people in our energy conservation program have already go a long way towards achieve a goal to which i be deeply dedicated let we do everything we can to avoid gasoline rationing in the united states of america
 last week i send to the congress a comprehensive special message set forth our energy situation recommend the legislative measure which be necessary to a program for meet our need if the embargo be lift this will ease the crisis but it will not mean an end to the energy shortage in america voluntary conservation will continue to be necessary and let i take this occasion to pay tribute once again to the splendid spirit of cooperation the american people have show which have make possible our success in meet this emergency up to this time
 the new legislation i have request will also remain necessary therefore i urge again that the energy measure that i have propose be make the first priority of this session of the congress these measure will require the oil company and other energy producer to provide the public with the necessary information on their supply they will prevent the injustice of windfall profit for a few as a result of the sacrifice of the million of americans and they will give we the organization the incentive the authority need to deal with the short term emergency and to move toward meet our long term need
 just as 1970 be the year in which we begin a full scale effort to protect the environment 1974 must be the year in which we organize a full scale effort to provide for our energy need not only in this decade but through the 21st century
 as we move toward the celebration two year from now of the 200th anniversary of this nation 's independence let we press vigorously on toward the goal i announce last november for project independence let this be our national goal at the end of this decade in the year 1980 the united states will not be dependent on any other country for the energy we need to provide our job to heat our home and to keep our transportation move
 to indicate the size of the government commitment to spur energy research and development we plan to spend $ 10 billion in federal fund over the next five year that be an enormous amount but during the same five year private enterprise will be invest as much as $ 200 billion and in 10 year $ 500 billion to develop the new resource the new technology the new capacity america will require for its energy need in the 1980s that be just a measure of the magnitude of the project we be undertake
 but america perform well when call to its big task it can truly be say that only in america could a task so tremendous be achieve so quickly and achieve not by regimentation but through the effort and ingenuity of a free people work in a free system
 turn now to the rest of the agenda for 1974 the time be at hand this year to bring comprehensive high quality health care within the reach of every american i shall propose a sweeping new program that will assure comprehensive health insurance protection to million of americans who can not now obtain it or afford it with vastly improve protection against catastrophic illness this will be a plan that maintain the high standard of quality in america 's health care and it will not require additional taxis
 now i recognize that other plan have be put forward that would cost $ 80 billion or even $ 100 billion and that would put our whole health care system under the heavy hand of the federal government this be the wrong approach this have be try abroad and it have fail it be not the way we do thing here in america this kind of plan would threaten the quality of care provide by our whole health care system the right way be one that build on the strength of the present system and one that do not destroy those strength one base on partnership not paternalism most important of all let we keep this as the guide principle of our health program government have a great role to play but we must always make sure that our doctor will be work for their patient and not for the federal government
 many of you will recall that in my state of the union address three year ago i comment that most americans today be simply feed up with government at all level and i recommend a sweeping set of proposal to revitalize state and local government to make they more responsive to the people they serve i can report to you today that as a result of revenue sharing pass by the congress and other measure we have make progress toward that goal after 40 year of move power from the state and the community to washington d.c. we have begin move power back from washington to the state and community and most important to the people of america
 in this session of the congress i believe we be near the breakthrough point on effort which i have suggest proposal to let people themselves make their own decision for their own community and in particular on those to provide broad new flexibility in federal aid for community development for economic development for education and i look forward to work with the congress with member of both party in resolve whatever remain difference we have in this legislation so that we can make available nearly $ 5.5 billion to our state and locality to use not for what a federal bureaucrat may want but for what their own people in those community want the decision should be theirs
 i think all of we recognize that the energy crisis have give new urgency to the need to improve public transportation not only in our city but in rural area as well the program i have propose this year will give community not only more money but also more freedom to balance their own transportation need it will mark the strong federal commitment ever to the improvement of mass transit as an essential element of the improvement of life in our town and city
 one goal on which all americans agree be that our child should have the very good education this great nation can provide
 in a special message last week i recommend a number of important new measure that can make 1974 a year of truly significant advance for our school and for the child they serve if the congress will act on these proposal more flexible funding will enable each federal dollar to meet well the particular need of each particular school district advance funding will give school authority a chance to make each year 's plan know ahead of time what federal fund they be go to receive special targeting will give special help to the truly disadvantaged among our people college student face with rise cost for their education will be able to draw on an expand program of loan and grant these advance be a need investment in america 's most precious resource our next generation and i urge the congress to act on this legislation in 1974
 one measure of a truly free society be the vigor with which it protect the liberty of its individual citizen as technology have advance in america it have increasingly encroach on one of those liberty what i term the right of personal privacy modern information system datum bank credit record mailing list abuse electronic snooping the collection of personal datum for one purpose that may be use for another all these have leave million of americans deeply concern by the privacy they cherish
 and the time have come therefore for a major initiative to define the nature and extent of the basic right of privacy and to erect new safeguard to ensure that those right be respect
 i shall launch such an effort this year at the high level of the administration and i look forward again to work with this congress in establish a new set of standard that respect the legitimate need of society but that also recognize personal privacy as a cardinal principle of american liberty
 many of those in this chamber tonight will recall that it be three year ago that i term the nation 's welfare system a monstrous consume outrage an outrage against the community against the taxpayer and particularly against the child that it be suppose to help
 that system be still an outrage by improve its administration we have be able to reduce some of the abuse as a result last year for the first time in 18 year there have be a halt in the growth of the welfare caseload but as a system our welfare program still need reform as urgently today as it do when i first propose in 1969 that we completely replace it with a different system
 in these final three year of my administration i urge the congress to join i in mount a major new effort to replace the discredit present welfare system with one that work one that be fair to those who need help or can not help themselves fair to the community and fair to the taxpayer and let we have as our goal that there will be no government program which make it more profitable to go on welfare than to go to work
 i recognize that from the debate that have take place within the congress over the past three year on this program that we can not expect enactment overnight of a new reform but i do propose that the congress and the administration together make this the year in which we discuss debate and shape such a reform so that it can be enact as quickly as possible
 america 's own prosperity in the year ahead depend on our sharing fully and equitably in an expand world prosperity historic negotiation will take place this year that will enable we to ensure fair treatment in international market for american worker american farmer american investor and american consumer
 it be vital that the authority contain in the trade bill i submit to the congress be enact so that the united states can negotiate flexibly and vigorously on behalf of american interest these negotiation can usher in a new era of international trade that not only increase the prosperity of all nation but also strengthen the peace among all nation
 in the past five year we have make more progress toward a lasting structure of peace in the world than in any comparable time in the nation 's history we could not have make that progress if we have not maintain the military strength of america thomas jefferson once observe that the price of liberty be eternal vigilance by the same token and for the same reason in today 's world the price of peace be a strong defense as far as the united states be concern
 in the past five year we have steadily reduce the burden of national defense as a share of the budget bring it down from 44 percent in 1969 to 29 percent in the current year we have cut our military manpower over the past five year by more than a third from 3.5 million to 2.2 million
 in the come year however increase expenditure will be need they will be need to assure the continue readiness of our military force to preserve present force level in the face of rise cost and to give we the military strength we must have if our security be to be maintain and if our initiative for peace be to succeed
 the question be not whether we can afford to maintain the necessary strength of our defense the question be whether we can afford not to maintain it and the answer to that question be no we must never allow america to become the second strong nation in the world
 i do not say this with any sense of belligerence because i recognize the fact that be recognize around the world america 's military strength have always be maintain to keep the peace never to break it it have always be use to defend freedom never to destroy it the world 's peace as well as our own depend on our remain as strong as we need to be as long as we need to be
 in this year 1974 we will be negotiate with the soviet union to place further limit on strategic nuclear arm together with our ally we will be negotiate with the nation of the warsaw pact on mutual and balanced reduction of force in europe and we will continue our effort to promote peaceful economic development in latin america in africa in asia we will press for full compliance with the peace accord that bring an end to american fighting in indochina include particularly a provision that promise the full possible accounting for those americans who be miss in action
 and have in mind the energy crisis to which i have refer to early we will be work with the other nation of the world toward agreement on mean by which oil supply can be assure at reasonable price on a stable basis in a fair way to the consume and produce nation alike
 all of these be step toward a future in which the world 's peace and prosperity and our as well as a result be make more secure
 throughout the five year that i have serve as your president i have have one overriding aim and that be to establish a new structure of peace in the world that can free future generation of the scourge of war i can understand that other may have different priority this have be and this will remain my first priority and the chief legacy i hope to leave from the eight year of my presidency
 this do not mean that we shall not have other priority because as we strengthen the peace we must also continue each year a steady strengthening of our society here at home our conscience require it our interest require it and we must insist upon it
 as we create more job as we build a well health care system as we improve our education as we develop new source of energy as we provide more abundantly for the elderly and the poor as we strengthen the system of private enterprise that produce our prosperity as we do all of this and even more we solidify those essential bond that hold we together as a nation
 even more importantly we advance what in the final analysis government in america be all about
 what it be all about be more freedom more security a well life for each one of the 211 million people that live in this land
 we can not afford to neglect progress at home while pursue peace abroad but neither can ave afford to neglect peace abroad while pursue progress at home with a stable peace all be possible but without peace nothing be possible
 in the write message that i have just deliver to the speaker and to the president of the senate i comment that one of the continue challenge face we in the legislative process be that of the timing and pacing of our initiative select each year among many worthy project those that be ripe for action at that time
 what be true in term of our domestic initiative be true also in the world this period we now be in in the world and i say this as one who have see so much of the world not only in these past five year but go back over many year we be in a period which present a juncture of historic force unique in this century they provide an opportunity we may never have again to create a structure of peace solid enough to last a lifetime and more not just peace in our time but peace in our child 's time as well it be on the way we respond to this opportunity more than anything else that history will judge whether we in america have meet our responsibility and i be confident we will meet that great historic responsibility which be ours today
 it be 27 year ago that john f. kennedy and i sit in this chamber as freshman congressman hear our first state of the union address deliver by harry truman i know from my talk with he as member of the labor committee on which we both serve that neither of we then even dream that either one or both might eventually be stand in this place that i now stand in now and that he once stand in before i it may well be that one of the freshmen member of the 93rd congress one of you out there will deliver his own state of the union message 27 year from now in the year 2001
 well whichever one it be i want you to be able to look back with pride and to say that your first year here be great year and recall that you be here in this 93rd congress when america end its long war and begin its long peace
 mr. speaker and mr. president and my distinguished colleague and our guest i would like to add a personal word with regard to an issue that have be of great concern to all americans over the past year i refer of course to the investigation of the so call watergate affair as you know i have provide to the special prosecutor voluntarily a great deal of material i believe that i have provide all the material that he need to conclude his investigation and to proceed to prosecute the guilty and to clear the innocent
 i believe the time have come to bring that investigation and the other investigation of this matter to an end one year of watergate be enough
 and the time have come my colleague for not only the executive the president but the member of congress for all of we to join together in devote our full energy to these great issue that i have discuss tonight which involve the welfare of all of the american people in so many different way as well as the peace of the world
 i recognize that the house judiciary committee have a special responsibility in this area and i want to indicate on this occasion that i will cooperate with the judiciary committee in its investigation i will cooperate so that it can conclude its investigation make its decision and i will cooperate in any way that i consider consistent with my responsibility to the office of the presidency of the united states
 there be only one limitation i will follow the precedent that have be follow by and defend by every president from george washington to lyndon b. johnson of never do anything that weaken the office of the president of the united states or impairs the ability of the president of the future to make the great decision that be so essential to this nation and the world
 another point i should like to make very briefly like every member of the house and senate assemble here tonight i be elect to the office that i hold and like every member of the house and senate when i be elect to that office i know that i be elect for the purpose of do a job and do it as well as i possibly can and i want you to know that i have no intention whatever of ever walk away from the job that the people elect i to do for the people of the united states
 now needless to say it would be understatement if i be not to admit that the year 1973 be not a very easy year for i personally or for my family and as i have already indicate the year 1974 present very great and serious problem as very great and serious opportunity be also present
 but my colleague this i believe with the help of god who have bless this land so richly with the cooperation of the congress and with the support of the american people we can and we will make the year 1974 a year of unprecedented progress toward our goal of build a structure of last peace in the world and a new prosperity without war in the united states of america

the president lady and gentleman before go to your question i have a brief report on the energy situation the progress we have make to date and also the problem that we have in the future
 you will recall that last october when we see the energy crisis develop as a result of the embargo and other matter that there be dire prediction that we would have problem with home heating oil and even fuel to run our factory
 as a result of the cooperation of the american people and they deserve most of the credit and also the management on the part of mr. simon and his organization we have now pass through that crisis the home fuel oil as far as it be concern as we know have be furnish no one have suffer as a result and as far as our plant be concern all have have the fuel that be require to keep the plant go
 the major problem that remain be one that be bring home to i when i talk to one of the soundman before come in i ask he if he be have any trouble get gas he say yes when i go to the service station this morning they would not give i any because my gage be wrong they think that i have more than half a tank actually i have zero in the tank
 i have see this problem as i have drive around in the miami area and also in the washington area the gas line the fact too that in the eastern states generally we do have a problem of shortage of gasoline which have be of course very difficult for many people go to work go to school or what have you
 mr. simon last week as you know at my direction allocate additional gasoline for these particular area and he be prepared to take more action in the future to deal with this problem
 as far as the entire situation be concern i be able to report tonight that as a result of the cooperation of the american people as a result too of our own energy conservation program within the government that i now believe confidently that there be much well than an even chance that there will be no need for gas rationing in the united states
 as far as that be concern however i should point out that while the crisis have pass the problem still remain and it be a very serious one
 and having report somewhat positively up to this point let i point out some of the negative situation that we confront
 one have to do with the congress the congress of course be work hard on this problem but i regret to say that the bill presently before the congress be one that if it reach my desk in its present form i will have to veto it
 i will have to veto it because what it do be simply to manage the shortage rather than to deal with the real problem and what should be our real goal and that be to get rid of the shortage
 for example there be a provision in the bill the present bill that provide for a rollback of price now this of course would be immediately popular but it would mean if we do have such a rollback that we would not only have more and long gas line but a rollback of price would lead to shortage which would require without question ration all over the country
 that would mean 17,000 to 20,000 more federal bureaucrat to run the system at a cost of $ 1 1/2 billion a year and this we should avoid this we can avoid
 and that be why i again urge the congress to act responsibly on the measure that we have present to the congress to deal with the problem of price and profit through the windfall profit measure that we have submit and to deal with the problem of gas shortage overall by get more supply and that mean the deregulation of natural gas so that it be competitive as far as price be concern the amendment of some of our environmental action so that we can use more coal and thereby take some of the pressure off of the demand for gasoline and other fuel the deepwater port and the other measure that i have mention on many occasion to the nation and also before member of the press
 look to the future i believe we can say now that while the crisis have be pass the problem remain it be a serious problem but it be one that can be deal with and our goal of become completely independent in energy independent of any foreign source be one that we can achieve but it will require the continued cooperation of the american people which i be sure we will get and responsible action by the congress action direct not simply toward distribute a shortage and make it bad but action which will increase supply and thereby get rid of the shortage
 question
 the president miss thomas i think you be number one tonight
 q mr. president to heal the division in this country would you be willing to waive executive privilege to give the judiciary committee what it say it need to end any question of your involvement in watergate
 the president miss thomas as you know the matter of the judiciary committee 's investigation be now be discuss by white house counsel mr. st. clair and mr. doar and as i indicate in my state of the union address i be prepared to cooperate with the committee in any way consistent with my constitutional responsibility to defend the office of the presidency against any action which would weaken that office and the ability of future president to carry out the great responsibility that any president will have
 mr. doar be conduct those negotiation with mr. st. clair and whatever be eventually arrange which will bring a prompt resolution of this matter i will cooperate in
 q mr. president john dunlop the price controller have say i do not think we know how to restrain inflation how confident be you that in the latter half of the year we can restrain inflation
 the president mr. cormier the problem of inflation be still a very nagging one the last figure as you know the one percent increase in one month of the consumer price index be a very troublesome one
 look to the future we be keenly aware of this problem and we be prepare to deal with it
 first we believe that it be vitally important to get at the source of the problem one be in the field of energy the way to get at the source of the problem in the field of energy be to increase supply i have already direct my comment to that point
 the other be in the field of food and in the field of food we have the same objective to increase supply and secretary butz indicate to i and to other member of the cabinet and the cost of living council that he expect that our supply through the balance of this year of food will go up and that that will have a restrain influence as far as food cost be concern
 with regard to inflation i should point out too that almost two third of the price increase the increase in price last year which be at a very high rate be due to energy and also to the problem of food
 by get at these two problem and by continue our cost of living council activity in the area that secretary shultz have testify to i believe that we will bring inflation under control as the year go on but i would not underestimate the problem
 we be go to continue to fight it it be go to have to take responsibility on the part of the congress to keep the budget within the limit that we have lay out it be also go to take an effort on the part of our farmer an effort on the part of the administration in the field of energy and the rest so that we can get the supply up because the answer to high price be not simply control control have be try and control have be find want the answer to high price be to get up the supply that will bring the price down
 q mr. president to follow up miss thomas question you say you will cooperate with the judiciary committee but you can not say yet precisely to what extent can you tell we if you anticipate you will be able to cooperate at least to the extent you cooperate with mr. jaworski in term of turn over to the judiciary committee roughly the same tape and document that mr. jaworski have
 the president well this be a matter mr. jarriel that have be discuss by mr. st. clair with mr. doar and the decision will be make base on what arrangement be develop between the two for the confidentiality of those particular item where they must remain confidential and also base on whether or not turn over to the committee will in any way jeopardize the right of defendant or impair the ability of the prosecution to carry on its proper function in the case that may develop it be a matter that we be talk about and it be a matter where we will be cooperative within those guideline
 q mr. president may i follow on to my colleague 's question and also to miss thomas question within the past week or 10 day the house judiciary committee and the justice department have issue differ interpretation of what by constitutional definition be an impeachable offense for a president
 now as we all know you be an experienced student of the constitution and i think people would be interested to know what you consider to be an impeachable offense for a president particularly on the dividing line whether it require that the house determine that they believe that the president may have commit a crime or whether dereliction of duty not uphold the constitution be enough in itself to constitute an impeachable offense
 the president well mr. rather you do not have to be a constitutional lawyer to know that the constitution be very precise in define what be an impeachable offense and in this respect it be the opinion of white house counsel and a number of other constitutional lawyer who be perhaps more up to date on this than i be at this time that a criminal offense on the part of the president be the requirement for impeachment
 this be a matter which will be present however to the committee by mr. st. clair in a brief which he presently be prepare
 q. mr. president i would like to follow up on your discussion of the energy situation when you say that the crisis be end that the problem be still with we i think for most people the problem be wait for a long time in line for gasoline and another part of it be the price of gasoline go up as it have be
 what can you tell the american people about when line for gasoline may become short under your program and what do you see in term of the future of the price of gasoline
 the president i believe that the line for gasoline will become short in the spring and summer month in fact that be the purpose of our program and i think we will achieve it
 as far as the price of gasoline be concern i would be less than candid if i be not to say that the price of gasoline be not go to go down until more supply of gasoline come into the country and also until other fuel come on stream which will reduce the pressure which be upward on the price of gasoline
 obviously too when the embargo be lift that is and will have some effect on the price of gasoline
 q mr. president when do you think the embargo might be lift
 the president the embargo question be one that i know be on the mind of all of we and it be one that presently be under consideration as you know by the oil produce country
 i should point out here that dr. kissinger 's trip to the mideast be direct toward get a disengagement or get talk start with regard to a disengagement on the syrian front that follow on the disengagement on the egyptian front i think will have a positive effect although it be not link to the problem of the embargo directly
 if i could perhaps elaborate just a bit on that as far as the oil produce country be concerned we believe it be in their interest to lift the embargo they should do that independently of what happen on the front of the negotiation with regard to develop a permanent peace in the mideast
 as far as we be concern we believe that get a permanent peace in the mideast be a goal worth achieve apart from the embargo
 but while they be not condition on one another by either party what happen in one area inevitably affect what happen in the other and i can say base on the conversation i have have with the foreign minister i meet with last week and base on the report i have receive to date i believe we be go to make continue progress on the peace front i believe that will be helpful in bring progress on get the embargo lift
 by the same token if the embargo be not lift it will naturally slow down the effort that we be make on the peace front and it be because i believe that we be go to make progress in develop those particular item that be essential towards movement toward a permanent peace in the mideast that the oil produce country will conclude that they should move on the embargo front
 q mr. president have the special prosecutor request your testimony in any form and if ask would you testify
 the president well i believe it be a matter of record that the special prosecutor transmit a request that i testify before the grand jury and on constitutional ground i respectfully decline to do so
 i do offer of course to respond to any interrogatory that the special prosecutor might want to submit or to meet with he personally and answer question and he indicate that he do not want to proceed in that way
 q mr. president however an impeachable offense be define under the system the impeachment proceeding be the courtroom of the president you have say many time that these matter belong in .the court so would not it be in your good interest and in the good interest of the country to have this matter finally resolve in a proper judicial forum that is a full impeachment trial in the senate
 the president well a full impeachment trial in the senate under our constitution come only when the house determine that there be an impeachable offense it be my belief that .the house after it conduct its inquiry will not reach that determination i do not expect to be impeach
 q mr. president the shah of iran say in an interview that the united states be get as much oil now as it do before the embargo and mr. simon of the federal energy office say that such a statement be irresponsible and reckless can you straighten we out be we get as much oil and why would the shah say this
 the president first i would not say that the shah be irresponsible and reckless however his information i think be different from ours and we have good reason to know what we be get
 we be get substantially less from the oil produce country in the mideast than we be before the embargo that be why we be of course very anxious to get the embargo lift as soon as possible
 q mr. president you have tell the american people that there will be no recession this year if the unemployment rate should go above 5 1/2 percent of the labor force what do you plan to do about this as an antirecession move and would that include a tax cut
 the president with regard to my statement that there will be no recession i have meet with my economic adviser just last week i go over this question in great detail
 we be go through what i would say be a downturn in the economy at this point but not a recession and for the balance of the year the prospect be good they be good because we be go to be deal with the energy crisis what be a crisis as a problem that will be helpful
 we expect to have an increase insofar as food be concern and as far as other element of the economy be concern there be very great area of strength the last half of the year we expect to be on an upward curve rather than the down curve
 however those be projection make by economist and i give direction to the office of management and budget mr. ash and to our economic adviser that we will be and should be prepare to deal effectively with any area of the country and there may be spot area of hardship through the budget mean and we have various contingency plan ready to go
 we will not stand by and allow this country because of the energy crisis and because of some of the problem we have have on the inflation front stand by and allow a recession to occur that be why i have be so positive in say that there will be no recession
 i have well turn this way
 q mr. president sir i want to ask you something i think you be not
 the president to sarah mcclendon mcclendon news service you have the loud voice you go right ahead
 q good thank you sir i do not think you be fully inform about some of the thing that be happen in the government in a domestic way i be sure it be not your fault but maybe the people that you appoint to office be not give you right information
 for example i have just discover that the veterans administration have absolutely no mean of tell precisely what be the national problem regard the payment of check to boy go to school under gi bill and many a young man in this country be be disillusion totally by his government these day because of the hardship be put upon he
 the president well this be a question which you very properly bring to the attention of the nation it be a question that have already be bring to my attention i be sure by a number of people
 q but sir you have mr.
 the president:—and the question if i may give the answer now be very simply this mr. don johnson of the veterans administration as you know act expeditiously when we have a case in california we have another one in illinois at the present time
 there be great number of veteran we have an adequate program to deal with it and i can assure you that when any matter be bring to my attention or to his we will deal with it as quickly as we can because our vietnam veteran and all veteran deserve whatever the law provide for they and i will see that they get it
 q he be the very man i be talk about who be not give you the correct information he stand up here at the white house the other day and give we false information he have no real system for get at the statistic on this problem
 the president well if he be not listen to this program i will report to he just what you say laughter
 he may have hear even though he be not listen to the program laughter
 q mr. president this be a political question
 the president the other be not political laughter
 q jerry ford 's old house seat be win by a democrat who campaign mainly on the theme that you should be remove or impeach or that you should resign what advice could you give republican candidate this year to counter that argument
 the president first i want republican candidate to win where they be deserve candidate and second i recall the year 1948 when we confidently expect to gain in the house and when mr. fulbright as you may recall call for president truman 's resignation in the spring because the economy be in a slump and president truman have other problem and we proceed to campaign against mr. truman he be the issue and we take a bad licking in the congress in 1948
 what my advice to the candidate very simply would be be this it be that 9 month before an election no one can predict what can happen in this country what will affect the election in this year 1974 be what always affect election peace and prosperity
 on the peace front we be do well and i think we will continue to do well with regard to the prosperity issue the bread and butter issue as i have already indicate i think that this economy be go to be move up
 i think therefore it will be a good year for those candidate who stand for the administration
 q mr. president as you prepare to sign your income tax return for this year do you intend to pay state or local income taxis and have you have any second thought about your claimed deduction for the gift of the vice presidential paper
 the president with regard to any state taxis or concern i will pay any that the law require as i understand in california a ruling have be make apparently that even though i have a residence in california that there be not a requirement that i pay california taxis
 i would be glad to pay those taxis and of course deduct that from my federal income tax liability as other can do if they desire to do so
 with regard to the gift of paper that i make to the government there be no question about my intent all of my vice presidential paper be deliver to the archives in march 4 month before the deadline the paperwork on it apparently be not conclude until after that time
 this raise a legal question as to whether or not the deduction therefore be proper that be why i voluntarily ask the senate control committee of the house and senate to look into the matter and to advise i as to whether or not the deduction be a proper one if it be not a proper one i of course will be glad to pay the tax
 q mr. president what be your personal reaction to the expulsion by the soviet union of alexander solzhenitsyn and will it any way affect our policy of detente
 the president well my personal reaction be that i be of course an admirer of a man who have win a nobel prize for literature and one who have also show as he have show such great courage
 second as far as our relation with the soviets be concern if i think that break relation with the soviets or turn off our policy of negotiation and turn back to confrontation would help he or help thousand of other like he in the soviet union we might do that
 on the other hand i look back to the year of confrontation and i find that man like he as a matter of fact rather than be send to paris would have be send to siberia or probably bad
 as far as our relation with the soviets be concern we shall continue we shall continue to negotiate recognize that they do not like our system or approve of it and i do not like their system or approve of it mr. brezhnev know that and i know it and we have discuss it quite bluntly and directly
 however it be essential that both nation be the super power that we be continue to make progress toward limit arm toward avoid confrontation which might explode into war as it might have in the mideast if we have not have this period of negotiation and also continue those negotiation for reduction of force in europe and reduction of arm or certainly the limitation of arm and the various other initiative that we be undertake with the soviets
 in a nutshell this be what we have to consider do we want to go back to a period when the united states and the soviet union the two great super power stand in confrontation against each other and risk a runaway nuclear arm race and also crisis in berlin in the mideast even again in southeast asia or other place of the world or do we want to continue on a path in which we recognize our difference but try to recognize also the fact that we must either live together or we will all die together
 q mr. president you have say on many occasion that you would not resign from the office to which you be elect but what if within the next few month it become evident that your party be go to suffer a disastrous defeat in this year 's election would you then reconsider your resolve on this
 the president no i want my party to succeed but more important i want the presidency to survive and it be vitally important in this nation that the presidency of the united states not be hostage to what happen to the popularity of a president at one time or another the stability of this office the ability of the president to continue to govern the ability for example of this president to continue the great initiative which have lead to a more peaceful world than we have have for a generation and to move on the domestic front in the many area that i have describe all of these thing these goal be yet before we
 we have a lot of work leave to do more than 3 year leave to do and i be go to stay here until i get it do
 q mr. president you have make a very strong defense on the confidentiality of presidential document and other matter and you have launch a program to protect the privacy of citizen of the united states
 in light of this would you explain how you happen to issue an executive order last year once modify to allow the agriculture department to examine key point of individual income tax return of america 's 3 million farmer and a justice department advisory opinion say that this executive order should serve as a model for all the federal government department
 the president well as a matter of fact in the privacy message which as you know i issue on saturday i do not raise this question specifically but certainly i want that question along with other consider because in this whole area of privacy it be not just a question of those who run credit bureau and bank and other with their huge computer but the federal government itself in its activity can very much impinge on the privacy of individual
 this be a matter that i think should be consider by the commission that i have appoint which be chair as you know by the vice president
 q thank you mr. president your personal lawyer mr. herb kalmbach enter a plea of guilty today to a criminal charge of accept $ 100,000 in exchange for an ambassadorial post in your capacity as president you approve of ambassador and send the nomination to the senate be you consult in any manner on this engagement and this contribution by mr. kalmbach or anyone else in the white house and have you do any research on this in the white house to determine who be responsible for it
 the president the answer to the first question be no the answer to the second question be yes and i would go far and say that ambassadorship have not be for sale to my knowledge ambassadorship can not be purchase and i would not approve an ambassadorship unless the man or woman be qualified clearly apart from any contribution
 q mr. president at our last meeting we be remiss in ask you for your reaction to the resignation of vice president agnew and so for the sake of fill in that hiatus in the record i would ask you if you believe that the conduct of the vice president and particularly his conduct surround and lead up to his resignation in fact bring dishonor upon his office this administration and the country
 the president it would be very easy for i to jump on the vice president when he be down i can only say that in his period of service that he render dedicated service in all of the assignment that i give to he
 he go through along with his family a terribly difficult situation and he resign as i think he think he should because of the embarrassment that he know that would cause to the administration and also because he feel that in view of the criminal offense that be charge that he should not stay in office now at this point i be not go to join anybody else in kick he when he be down
 q mr. president thank you very much to follow on an early question about taxis april 21 1969 be a significant day for you in taxis and for the country too that be the notary date on the deed that allow you to give your paper to the government and pay just token taxis for e year on that same date you have a tax reform message in which you say and i quote special preference in the law permit far too many americans to pay less than their fair share of taxis too many other bear too much of the tax burden
 now mr. president do you think you pay your fair share of taxis
 the president well i would point out that those who make deduction such as i make in this particular instance include john kenneth galbraith jerome wiesner vice president humphrey president johnson a number of other i do not write that law when it be bring to my attention rather vigorously by president johnson when i see he shortly after my election he think that it would be wise for i to give my paper to the government and take the proper deduction
 i do that under the circumstance as you know now that deduction be no long allow as far as i be concern i think that be probably a proper decision
 q in your state of the union address you mention that arab leader have assure you that they be call an urgent meeting to discuss or consider the lifting of the embargo be you mislead by the arab leader or what happen to that meeting
 the president mr. lisagor we be inform that they be call an urgent meeting we expect that to take place on the 14th of february but the arab leader as you know be not a united group necessarily and that be an understatement under the circumstance while the arab leader who have give we this assurance try to go forward with the meeting they be unable to get the cooperation of other
 i believe now however that they will get that cooperation that the meeting will be hold and i believe that they will lift the embargo

good evening
 i have ask for this time tonight in order to announce my answer to the house judiciary committee 's subpoena for additional watergate tape and to tell you something about the action i shall be take tomorrow about what i hope they will mean to you and about the very difficult choice that be present to i
 these action will at last once and for all show that what i know and what i do with regard to the watergate break in and coverup be just as i have describe they to you from the very beginning
 i have spend many hour during the past few week think about what i would say to the american people if i be to reach the decision i shall announce tonight and so my word have not be lightly choose i can assure you they be deeply feel
 it be almost e year ago in june 1972 that five man break into the democratic national committee headquarters in washington it turn out that they be connect with my reelection committee and the watergate break in become a major issue in the campaign
 the full resource of the fbi and the justice department be use to investigate the incident thoroughly i instruct my staff and campaign aide to cooperate fully with the investigation the fbi conduct nearly 1,500 interview for 9 month until march 1973 i be assure by those charge with conduct and monitor the investigation that no one in the white house be involve
 nevertheless for more than a year there have be allegation and insinuation that i know about the planning of the watergate break in and that i be involve in an extensive plot to cover it up the house judiciary committee be now investigate these charge
 on march 6 i order all material that i have previously furnish to the special prosecutor turn over to the committee these include tape recording of 19 presidential conversation and more than 700 document from private white house file
 on april 11 the judiciary committee issue a subpoena for 42 additional tape of conversation which it contend be necessary for its investigation i agree to respond to that subpoena by tomorrow
 in these folder that you see over here on my left be more than 1,200 page of transcript of private conversation i participate in between september 15 1972 and april 27 of 1973 with my principal aide and associate with regard to watergate they include all the relevant portion of all of the subpoena conversation that be record that is all portion that relate to the question of what i know about watergate or the coverup and what i do about it
 they also include transcript of other conversation which be not subpoena but which have a significant bearing on the question of presidential action with regard to watergate these will be deliver to the committee tomorrow
 in these transcript portion not relevant to my knowledge or action with regard to watergate be not include but everything that be relevant be include the rough as well as the smooth the strategy session the exploration of alternative the weighing of human and political cost
 as far as what the president personally know and do with regard to watergate and the coverup be concern these material together with those already make available will tell it all
 i shall invite chairman rodino and the committee 's rank minority member congressman hutchinson of michigan to come to the white house and listen to the actual full tape of these conversation so that they can determine for themselves beyond question that the transcript be accurate and that everything on the tape relevant to my knowledge and my action on watergate be include if there should be any disagreement over whether omit material be relevant i shall meet with they personally in an effort to settle the matter i believe this arrangement be fair and i think it be appropriate
 for many day now i have spend many hour of my own time personally review these material and personally decide question of relevancy i believe it be appropriate that the committee 's review should also be make by its own senior elect official and not by staff employee
 the task of chairman rodino and congressman hutchinson will be make simple than be mine by the fact that the work of prepare the transcript have be complete all they will need to do be to satisfy themselves of their authenticity and their completeness
 ever since the existence of the white house tape system be first make known last summer i have try vigorously to guard the privacy of the tape i have be well aware that my effort to protect the confidentiality of presidential conversation have heighten the sense of mystery about watergate and in fact have cause increase suspicion of the president many people assume that the tape must incriminate the president or that otherwise he would not insist on their privacy
 but the problem i confront be this unless a president can protect the privacy of the advice he get he can not get the advice he need
 this principle be recognize in the constitutional doctrine of executive privilege which have be defend and maintain by every president since washington and which have be recognize by the court whenever test as inherent in the presidency i consider it to be my constitutional responsibility to defend this principle
 three factor have now combine to persuade i that a major unprecedented exception to that principle be now necessary
 first in the present circumstance the house of representatives must be able to reach an informed judgment about the president 's role in watergate
 second i be make a major exception to the principle of confidentiality because i believe such action be now necessary in order to restore the principle itself by clear the air of the central question that have bring such pressure upon it and also to provide the evidence which will allow this matter to be bring to a prompt conclusion
 third in the context of the current impeachment climate i believe all the american people as well as their representative in congress be entitle to have not only the fact but also the evidence that demonstrate those fact
 i want there to be no question remain about the fact that the president have nothing to hide in this matter
 the impeachment of a president be a remedy of last resort it be the most solemn act of our entire constitutional process now regardless of whether or not it succeed the action of the house in vote a formal accusation require trial by the senate would put the nation through a wrench ordeal it have endure only once in its lifetime a century ago and never since america have become a world power with global responsibility
 the impact of such an ordeal would be feel throughout the world and it would have its effect on the life of all americans for many year to come
 because this be an issue that profoundly affect all the american people in addition to turn over these transcript to the house judiciary committee i have direct that they should all be make public all of these that you see here
 to complete the record i shall also release to the public transcript of all those portion of the tape already turn over to the special prosecutor and to the committee that relate to presidential action or knowledge of the watergate affair
 during the past year the wild accusation have be give banner headline and ready credence as well rumor gossip innuendo account from unnamed source of what a prospective witness might testify to have fill the morning newspaper and then be repeat on the evening newscast day after day
 time and again a familiar pattern repeat itself a charge would be report the first day as what it be just an allegation but it would then be refer back to the next day and thereafter as if it be true
 the distinction between fact and speculation grew blur eventually all seep into the public consciousness as a vague general impression of massive wrongdoing implicate everybody gain credibility by its endless repetition
 the basic question at issue today be whether the president personally act improperly in the watergate matter month after month of rumor insinuation and charge by just one watergate witness john dean suggest that the president do act improperly
 this spark the demand for an impeachment inquiry this be the question that must be answer and this be the question that will be answer by these transcript that i have order publish tomorrow
 these transcript cover hour upon hour of discussion that i hold with mr. haldeman john ehrlichman john dean john mitchell former attorney general kleindienst assistant attorney general petersen and other with regard to watergate
 they be discussion in which i be probe to find out what have happen who be responsible what be the various degree of responsibility what be the legal capability what be the political ramification and what action be necessary and appropriate on the part of the president
 i realize that these transcript will provide grist for many sensational story in the press part will seem to be contradictory with one another and part will be in conflict with some of the testimony give in the senate watergate committee hearing
 i have be reluctant to release these tape not just because they will embarrass i and those with whom i have talk which they will and not just because they will become the subject of speculation and even ridicule which they will and not just because certain part of they will be seize upon by political and journalistic opponent which they will
 i have be reluctant because in these and in all the other conversation in this office people have speak their mind freely never dream that specific sentence or even part of sentence would be pick out as the subject of national attention and controversy
 i have be reluctant because the principle of confidentiality be absolutely essential to the conduct of the presidency in read the raw transcript of these conversation i believe it will be more readily apparent why that principle be essential and must be maintain in the future these conversation be unusual in their subject matter but the same kind of uninhibited discussion and it be that the same brutal candor be necessary in discuss how to bring war faction to the peace table or how to move necessary legislation through the congress
 name be name in these transcript therefore it be important to remember that much that appear in they be no more than hearsay or speculation exchange as i be try to find out what really have happen while my principal aide be report to i on rumor and report that they have hear while we discuss the various often conflict story that different person be tell
 as the transcript will demonstrate my concern during this period cover a wide range the first and obvious one be to find out just exactly what have happen and who be involve
 a second concern be for the people who have be or might become involve in watergate some be close adviser value friend other whom i have trust and i be also concerned about the human impact on other especially some of the young people and their family who have come to washington to work in my administration whose life might be suddenly ruin by something they have do in an excess of loyalty or in the mistaken belief that it would serve the interest of the president
 and then i be quite frankly concerned about the political implication this represent potentially a devastating blow to the administration and to its program one which i know would be exploit for all it be worth by hostile element in the congress as well as in the medium i want to do what be right but i want to do it in a way that would cause the least unnecessary damage in a highly charge political atmosphere to the administration
 and fourth as a lawyer i feel very strongly that i have to conduct myself in a way that would not prejudice the right of potential defendant
 and fifth i be strive to sort out a complex tangle not only of fact but also question of legal and moral responsibility i want above all to be fair i want to draw distinction where those be appropriate between person who be active and willing participant on the one hand and on the other those who might have get inadvertently catch up in the web and be technically indictable but morally innocent
 despite the confusion and contradiction what do come through clearly be this
 john dean charge in swear senate testimony that i be fully aware of the coverup at the time of our first meeting on september 15 1972 these transcript show clearly that i first learn of it when mr. dean himself tell i about it in this office on march 21 some 6 month later
 incidentally these transcript cover hour upon hour of conversation should place in somewhat well perspective the controversy over the 18 1/2 minute gap in the tape of a conversation i have with mr. haldeman back in june of 1972
 now how it be cause be still a mystery to i and i think to many of the expert as well but i be absolutely certain however of one thing that it be not cause intentionally by my secretary rose mary woods or any of my white house assistant and certainly if the theory be true that during those 18 1/2 minute mr. haldeman and i cook up some sort of a watergate coverup scheme as so many have be quick to surmise it hardly seem likely that in all of our subsequent conversation many of they be here which neither of we ever expect would see the light of day there be nothing remotely indicate such a scheme indeed quite the contrary
 from the beginning i have say that in many place on the tape there be ambiguity a statement and comment that different people with different perspective might interpret in drastically different way but although the word may be ambiguous though the discussion may have explore many alternative the record of my action be totally clear now and i still believe it be totally correct then
 a prime example be one of the most controversial discussion that with mr. dean on march 21 the one in which he first tell i of the coverup with mr. haldeman join we midway through the conversation
 his revelation to i on march 21 be a sharp surprise even though the report he give to i be far from complete especially since he do not reveal at that time the extent of his own criminal involvement
 i be particularly concerned by his report that one of the watergate defendant howard hunt be threaten blackmail unless he and his lawyer be immediately give $ 121,000 for legal fee and family support and that he be attempt to blackmail the white house not by threaten exposure on the watergate matter but by threaten to reveal activity that would expose extremely sensitive highly secret national security matter that he have work on before watergate
 i probe question try to learn all mr. dean know about who be involve what be involve i ask more than 150 question of mr. dean in the course of that conversation
 he say to i and i quote from the transcript directly i can just tell from our conversation that these be thing that you have no knowledge of
 it be only considerably later that i learn how much there be that he do not tell i then for example that he himself have authorize promise of clemency that he have personally handle money for the watergate defendant and that he have suborn perjury of a witness
 i know that i need more fact i know that i need the judgment of more people i know the fact about the watergate coverup would have to be make public but i have to find out more about what they be before i could decide how they could well be make public
 i return several time to the immediate problem pose by mr. hunt 's blackmail threat which to i be not a watergate problem but one which i regard rightly or wrongly as a potential national security problem of very serious proportion i consider long and hard whether it might in fact be well to let the payment go forward at least temporarily in the hope that this national security matter would not be expose in the course of uncover the watergate coverup
 i believe then and i believe today that i have a responsibility as president to consider every option include this one where production of sensitive national security matter be at issue protection of such matter in the course of consider it and of just think out loud as i put it at one point i several time suggest that meet hunt 's demand might be necessary
 but then i also trace through where that would lead the money could be raise but money demand would lead inescapably to clemency demand and clemency could not be grant i say and i quote directly from the tape it be wrong that be for sure i point out and i quote again from the tape but in the end we be go to be bleed to death and in the end it be all go to come out anyway then you get the bad of both world we be go to lose and people be go to
 and mr. haldeman interrupt i and say and look like dope
 and i respond and in effect look like a coverup so that we can not do
 now i recognize that this tape of march 21 be one which different meaning could be read in by different people but by the end of the meeting as the tape show my decision be to convene a new grand jury and to send everyone before the grand jury with instruction to testify
 whatever the potential for misinterpretation there may be as a result of the different option that be discuss at different time during the meeting my conclusion at the end of the meeting be clear and my action and reaction as demonstrate on the tape that follow that date show clearly that i do not in tend the further payment to hunt or anyone else be make these be some of the action that i take in the week that follow in my effort to find the truth to carry out my responsibility to enforce the law
 as a tape of our meeting on march 22 the next day indicate i direct mr. dean to go to camp david with instruction to put together a write report i learn five day later on march 26 that he be unable to complete it and so on march 27 i assign john ehrlichman to try to find out what have happen who be at fault and in what way and to what degree
 one of the transcript i be make public be a call that mr. ehrlichman make to the attorney general on march 28 in which he ask the attorney general to report to i the president directly any information he might find indicate possible involvement of john mitchell or by anyone in the white house i have mr. haldeman separately pursue other independent line of inquiry
 throughout i be try to reach determination on matter of both substance and procedure on what the fact be and what be the good way to move the case forward i conclude that i want everyone to go before the grand jury and testify freely and fully this decision as you will recall be publicly announce on march 30 1973 i waive executive privilege in order to permit everybody to testify i specifically waive executive privilege with regard to conversation with the president and i waive the attorney client privilege with john dean in order to permit he to testify fully and i hope truthfully
 finally on april 14 three week after i learn of the coverup from mr. dean mr. ehrlichman report to i on the result of his investigation as he acknowledge much of what he have gather be hearsay but he have gather enough to make it clear that the next step be to make his finding completely available to the attorney general which i instruct he to do
 and the next day sunday april 15 attorney general kleindienst ask to see i and he report new information which have come to his attention on this matter and although he be in no way whatever involve in watergate because of his close personal tie not only to john mitchell but to other potential people who might be involve he quite properly remove himself from the case
 we agree that assistant attorney general henry petersen the head of the criminal division a democrat and career prosecutor should be place in complete charge of the investigation
 later that day i meet with mr. petersen i continue to meet with he to talk with he to consult with he to offer he the full cooperation of the white house as you will see from these transcript even to the point of retain john dean on the white house staff for an extra e week after he admit his criminal involvement because mr. petersen think that would make it easy for the prosecutor to get his cooperation in break the case if it should become necessary to grant mr. dean 's demand for immunity
 on april 15 when i hear that one of the obstacle to break the case be gordon liddy 's refusal to talk i telephone mr. petersen and direct that he should make clear not only to mr. liddy but to everyone that and now i quote directly from the tape of that telephone call—"a far as the president be concern everybody in this case be to talk and to tell the truth i tell he if necessary i would personally meet with mr. liddy 's lawyer to assure he that i want liddy to talk and to tell the truth
 from the time mr. petersen take charge the case be solidly within the criminal justice system pursue personally by the nation 's top professional prosecutor with the active personal assistance of the president of the united states
 i make clear there be to be no coverup
 let i quote just a few line from the transcript you can read they to verify they so that you can hear for yourself the order i be give in this period
 speak to haldeman and ehrlichman i say it be ridiculous to talk about clemency they all know that
 speak to ehrlichman i say we all have to do the fight thing we just can not have this kind of a business
 speak to haldeman and ehrlichman i say the boil have to be prick we have to prick the boil and take the heat now that be what we be do here
 speak to henry petersen i say i want you to be sure to understand that you know we be go to get to the bottom of this thing
 speak to john dean i say tell the truth that be the thing i have tell everybody around here
 and then speak to haldeman and you tell magruder now jeb this evidence be come in you ought to go to the grand jury purge yourself if you be perjure and tell this whole story
 i be confident that the american people will see these transcript for what they be fragmentary record from a time more than a year ago that now seem very distant the record of a president and of a man suddenly be confront and have to cope with information which if true would have the most far reach consequence not only for his personal reputation but more important for his hope his plan his goal for the people who have elect he as their leader
 if read with an open and a fair mind and read together with the record of the action i take these transcript will show that what i have state from the beginning to be the truth have be the truth that i personally have no knowledge of the break in before it occur that i have no knowledge of the coverup until i be inform of it by john dean on march 21 that i never offer clemency for the defendant and that after march 21 my action be direct toward find the fact and see that justice be do fairly and accord to the law
 the fact be there the conversation be there the record of action be there
 to anyone who read his way through this mass of material i have provide it will be totally abundantly clear that as far as the president 's role with regard to watergate be concern the entire story be there
 as you will see now that you also will have this mass of evidence i have provide i have try to cooperate with the house judiciary committee and i repeat tonight the offer that i have make previously to answer write interrogatory under oath and if there be then issue still unresolved to meet personally with the chairman of the committee and with congressman hutchinson to answer their question under oath
 as the committee conduct its inquiry i also consider it only essential and fair that my counsel mr. st. clair should be present to cross examine witness and introduce evidence in an effort to establish the truth
 i be confident that for the overwhelming majority of those who study the evidence that i shall release tomorrow those who be willing to look at it fully fairly and objectively the evidence will be persuasive and i hope conclusive
 we live in a time of very great challenge and great opportunity for america
 we live at a time when peace may become possible in the middle east for the first time in a generation
 we be at last in the process of fulfil the hope of mankind for a limitation on nuclear arm a process that will continue when i meet with the soviet leader in moscow in a few week
 we be well on the way toward build a peace that can last not just for this but for other generation as well
 and here at home there be vital work to be do in move to control inflation to develop our energy resource to strengthen our economy so that americans can enjoy what they have not have since 1956 full prosperity without war and without inflation
 every day absorb by watergate be a day lose from the work that must be do by your president and by your congress work that must be do in deal with the great problem that affect your prosperity affect your security that could affect your life
 the material i make public tomorrow will provide all the additional evidence need to get watergate behind we and to get it behind we now
 never before in the history of the presidency have record that be so private be make so public
 in give you these record blemish and all i be place my trust in the basic fairness of the american people
 i know in my own heart that through the long painful and difficult process reveal in these transcript i be try in that period to discover what be right and to do what be right
 i hope and i trust that when you have see the evidence in its entirety you will see the truth of that statement
 as for myself i intend to go forward to the good of my ability with the work that you elect i to do i shall do so in a spirit perhaps well sum up a century ago by another president when he be be subject to unmerciful attack abraham lincoln say
 i do the very good i know how the very good i can and i mean to keep do so until the end if the end bring i out all right what be say against i will not amount to anything if the end bring i out wrong ten angel swear i be right would make no difference
 thank you and good evening

good evening
 this be the 37th time i have speak to you from this office where so many decision have be make that shape the history of this nation each time i have do so to discuss with you some matter that i believe affect the national interest
 in all the decision i have make in my public life i have always try to do what be good for the nation throughout the long and difficult period of watergate i have feel it be my duty to persevere to make every possible effort to complete the term of office to which you elect i
 in the past few day however it have become evident to i that i no long have a strong enough political base in the congress to justify continue that effort as long as there be such a base i feel strongly that it be necessary to see the constitutional process through to its conclusion that to do otherwise would be unfaithful to the spirit of that deliberately difficult process and a dangerously destabilizing precedent for the future
 but with the disappearance of that base i now believe that the constitutional purpose have be serve and there be no long a need for the process to be prolong
 i would have prefer to carry through to the finish whatever the personal agony it would have involve and my family unanimously urge i to do so but the interest of the nation must always come before any personal consideration
 from the discussion i have have with congressional and other leader i have conclude that because of the watergate matter i might not have the support of the congress that i would consider necessary to back the very difficult decision and carry out the duty of this office in the way the interest of the nation will require
 i have never be a quitter to leave office before my term be complete be abhorrent to every instinct in my body but as president i must put the interest of america first america need a full time president and a full time congress particularly at this time with problem we face at home and abroad
 to continue to fight through the month ahead for my personal vindication would almost totally absorb the time and attention of both the president and the congress in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issue of peace abroad and prosperity without inflation at home
 therefore i shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow vice president ford will be swear in as president at that hour in this office
 as i recall the high hope for america with which we begin this second term i feel a great sadness that i will not be here in this office work on your behalf to achieve those hope in the next 2 1/2 year but in turn over direction of the government to vice president ford i know as i tell the nation when i nominate he for that office 10 month ago that the leadership of america will be in good hand
 in pass this office to the vice president i also do so with the profound sense of the weight of responsibility that will fall on his shoulder tomorrow and therefore of the understanding the patience the cooperation he will need from all americans
 as he assume that responsibility he will deserve the help and the support of all of we as we look to the future the first essential be to begin heal the wound of this nation to put the bitterness and division of the recent past behind we and to rediscover those share ideal that lie at the heart of our strength and unity as a great and as a free people
 by take this action i hope that i will have hasten the start of that process of healing which be so desperately need in america
 i regret deeply any injury that may have be do in the course of the event that lead to this decision i would say only that if some of my judgment be wrong and some be wrong they be make in what i believe at the time to be the good interest of the nation
 to those who have stand with i during these past difficult month to my family my friend to many other who join in support my cause because they believe it be right i will be eternally grateful for your support
 and to those who have not feel able to give i your support let i say i leave with no bitterness toward those who have oppose i because all of we in the final analysis have be concern with the good of the country however our judgment might differ
 so let we all now join together in affirm that common commitment and in help our new president succeed for the benefit of all americans
 i shall leave this office with regret at not complete my term but with gratitude for the privilege of serve as your president for the past 5 1/2 year these year have be a momentous time in the history of our nation and the world they have be a time of achievement in which we can all be proud achievement that represent the share effort of the administration the congress and the people
 but the challenge ahead be equally great and they too will require the support and the effort of the congress and the people work in cooperation with the new administration
 we have end america 's long war but in the work of secure a last peace in the world the goal ahead be even more far reach and more difficult we must complete a structure of peace so that it will be say of this generation our generation of americans by the people of all nation not only that we end one war but that we prevent future war
 we have unlock the door that for a quarter of a century stand between the united states and the people 's republic of china
 we must now ensure that the one quarter of the world 's people who live in the people 's republic of china will be and remain not our enemy but our friend
 in the middle east 100 million people in the arab country many of whom have consider we their enemy for nearly 20 year now look on we as their friend we must continue to build on that friendship so that peace can settle at last over the middle east and so that the cradle of civilization will not become its grave
 together with the soviet union we have make the crucial breakthrough that have begin the process of limit nuclear arm but we must set as our goal not just limit but reduce and finally destroy these terrible weapon so that they can not destroy civilization and so that the threat of nuclear war will no long hang over the world and the people
 we have open the new relation with the soviet union we must continue to develop and expand that new relationship so that the two strong nation of the world will live together in cooperation rather than confrontation
 around the world in asia in africa in latin america in the middle east there be million of people who live in terrible poverty even starvation we must keep as our goal turn away from production for war and expand production for peace so that people everywhere on this earth can at last look forward in their child 's time if not in our own time to have the necessity for a decent life
 here in america we be fortunate that most of our people have not only the blessing of liberty but also the mean to live full and good and by the world 's standard even abundant life we must press on however toward a goal not only of more and well job but of full opportunity for every american and of what we be strive so hard right now to achieve prosperity without inflation
 for more than a quarter of a century in public life i have share in the turbulent history of this era i have fight for what i believe in i have try to the good of my ability to discharge those duty and meet those responsibility that be entrust to i
 sometimes i have succeed and sometimes i have fail but always i have take heart from what theodore roosevelt once say about the man in the arena whose face be mar by dust and sweat and blood who strive valiantly who err and come short again and again because there be not effort without error and shortcoming but who do actually strive to do the deed who know the great enthusiasm the great devotion who spend himself in a worthy cause who at the good know in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the bad if he fail at least fail while dare greatly
 i pledge to you tonight that as long as i have a breath of life in my body i shall continue in that spirit i shall continue to work for the great cause to which i have be dedicate throughout my year as a congressman a senator vice president and president the cause of peace not just for america but among all nation prosperity justice and opportunity for all of our people

 i have do my very good in all the day since to be true to that pledge as a result of these effort i be confident that the world be a safe place today not only for the people of america but for the people of all nation and that all of our child have a well chance than before of live in peace rather than die in war
 this more than anything be what i hope to achieve when i seek the presidency this more than anything be what i hope will be my legacy to you to our country as i leave the presidency

 the oath that i have take be the same oath that be take by george washington and by every president under the constitution but i assume the presidency under extraordinary circumstance never before experience by americans this be an hour of history that trouble our mind and hurt our heart

 i be acutely aware that you have not elect i as your president by your ballot and so i ask you to confirm i as your president with your prayer and i hope that such prayer will also be the first of many
 if you have not choose i by secret ballot neither have i gain office by any secret promise i have not campaign either for the presidency or the vice presidency i have not subscribe to any partisan platform i be indebted to no man and only to one woman my dear wife as i begin this very difficult job
 i have not seek this enormous responsibility but i will not shirk it those who nominate and confirm i as vice president be my friend and be my friend they be of both party elect by all the people and act under the constitution in their name it be only fitting then that i should pledge to they and to you that i will be the president of all the people
 thomas jefferson say the people be the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty and down the year abraham lincoln renew this american article of faith ask be there any well way or equal hope in the world
 i intend on monday next to request of the speaker of the house of representatives and the president pro tempore of the senate the privilege of appear before the congress to share with my former colleague and with you the american people my view on the priority business of the nation and to solicit your view and their view and may i say to the speaker and the other if i could meet with you right after these remark i would appreciate it
 even though this be late in an election year there be no way we can go forward except together and no way anybody can win except by serve the people 's urgent need we can not stand still or slip backwards we must go forward now together
 to the people and the government of all friendly nation and i hope that could encompass the whole world i pledge an uninterrupted and sincere search for peace america will remain strong and united but its strength will remain dedicated to the safety and sanity of the entire family of man as well as to our own precious freedom
 i believe that truth be the glue that hold government together not only our government but civilization itself that bond though strain be unbroken at home and abroad
 in all my public and private act as your president i expect to follow my instinct of openness and candor with full confidence that honesty be always the good policy in the end
 my fellow americans our long national nightmare be over
 our constitution work our great republic be a government of law and not of man here the people rule but there be a high power by whatever name we honor he who ordain not only righteousness but love not only justice but mercy
 as we bind up the internal wound of watergate more painful and more poisonous than those of foreign war let we restore the golden rule to our political process and let brotherly love purge our heart of suspicion and of hate
 in the beginning i ask you to pray for i before closing i ask again your prayer for richard nixon and for his family may our former president who bring peace to million find it for himself may god bless and comfort his wonderful wife and daughter whose love and loyalty will forever be a shine legacy to all who bear the lonely burden of the white house
 i can only guess at those burden although i have witness at close hand the tragedy that befell three president and the less trial of other
 with all the strength and all the good sense i have gain from life with all the confidence my family my friend and my dedicated staff impart to i and with the good will of countless americans i have encounter in recent visit to 40 states i now solemnly reaffirm my promise i make to you last december 6 to uphold the constitution to do what be right as god give i to see the right and to do the very good i can for america
 god help i i will not let you down
 thank you

member of the cabinet member of the white house staff all of our friend here
 i think the record should show that this be one of those spontaneous thing that we always arrange whenever the president come in to speak and it will be so report in the press and we do not mind because they have to call it as they see it
 but on our part believe i it be spontaneous
 you be here to say goodby to we and we do not have a good word for it in english the good be au revoir we will see you again
 i just meet with the member of the white house staff you know those who serve here in the white house day in and day out and i ask they to do what i ask all of you to do to the extent that you can and of course be request to do so to serve our next president as you have serve i and previous president because many of you have be here for many year with devotion and dedication because this office great as it be can only be as great as the man and woman who work for and with the president
 this house for example i be think of it as we walk down this hall and i be compare it to some of the great house of the world that i have be in this be not the big house many and most in even small country be much big this be not the fine house many in europe particularly and in china asia have painting of great great value thing that we just do not have here and probably will never have until we be 1,000 year old or old
 but this be the good house it be the good house because it have something far more important than number of people who serve far more important than number of room or how big it be far more important than number of magnificent piece of art
 this house have a great heart and that heart come from those who serve i be rather sorry they do not come down we say goodby to they upstairs but they be really great and i recall after so many time i have make speech and some of they pretty tough yet i always come back or after a hard day and my day usually have run rather long i would always get a lift from they because i might be a little down but they always smile
 and so it be with you i look around here and i see so many on this staff that you know i should have be by your office and shake hand and i would love to have talk to you and find out how to run the world everybody want to tell the president what to do and boy he need to be tell many time but i just have not have the time but i want you to know that each and every one of you i know be indispensable to this government
 i be proud of this cabinet i be proud of all the member who have serve in our cabinet i be proud of our sub cabinet i be proud of our white house staff as i point out last night sure we have do some thing wrong in this administration and the top man always take the responsibility and i have never duck it but i want to say one thing we can be proud of it—5 1/2 year no man or no woman come into this administration and leave it with more of this world 's good than when he come in no man or no woman ever profit at the public expense or the public till that tell something about you
 mistake yes but for personal gain never you do what you believe in sometimes right sometimes wrong and i only wish that i be a wealthy man at the present time i have get to find a way to pay my taxes—[laughter]—and if i be i would like to recompense you for the sacrifice that all of you have make to serve in government
 but you be get something in government and i want you to tell this to your child and i hope the nation 's child will hear it too something in government service that be far more important than money it be a cause big than yourself it be the cause of make this the great nation in the world the leader of the world because without our leadership the world will know nothing but war possibly starvation or bad in the year ahead with our leadership it will know peace it will know plenty
 we have be generous and we will be more generous in the future as we be able to but most important we must be strong here strong in our heart strong in our soul strong in our belief and strong in our willingness to sacrifice as you have be willing to sacrifice in a pecuniary way to serve in government
 there be something else i would like for you to tell your young people you know people often come in and say what will i tell my kid they look at government and say sort of a rugged life and they see the mistake that be make they get the impression that everybody be here for the purpose of feather his nest that be why i make this early point not in this administration not one single man or woman
 and i say to they there be many fine career this country need good farmer good businessman good plumber good carpenter
 i remember my old man i think that they would have call he sort of a little man common man he do not consider himself that way you know what he be he be a streetcar motorman first and then he be a farmer and then he have a lemon ranch it be the poor lemon ranch in california i can assure you he sell it before they find oil on it laughter and then he be a grocer but he be a great man because he do his job and every job count up to the hilt regardless of what happen
 nobody will ever write a book probably about my mother well i guess all of you would say this about your mother my mother be a saint and i think of she two boy die of tuberculosis nurse four other in order that she could take care of my old brother for three year in arizona and see each of they die and when they die it be like one of her own
 yes she will have no book write about she but she be a saint
 now however we look to the future i have a little quote in the speech last night from t.r. as you know i kind of like to read book i be not educate but i do read books—[laughter]—and the t.r. quote be a pretty good one
 here be another one i find as i be read my last night in the white house and this quote be about a young man he be a young lawyer in new york he have marry a beautiful girl and they have a lovely daughter and then suddenly she die and this be what he write this be in his diary
 he say she be beautiful in face and form and lovelier still in spirit as a flower she grow and as a fair young flower she die her life have be always in the sunshine there have never come to she a single great sorrow none ever know she who do not love and revere she for her bright and sunny temper and her saintly unselfishness fair pure and joyous as a maiden loving tender and happy as a young wife when she have just become a mother when her life seem to be just begin and when the year seem so bright before she then by a strange and terrible fate death come to she and when my heart 's dearest die the light go from my life forever
 that be t.r. in his twenty he think the light have go from his life forever but he go on and he not only become president but as an ex president he serve his country always in the arena tempestuous strong sometimes wrong sometimes right but he be a man
 and as i leave let i say that be an example i think all of we should remember we think sometimes when thing happen that do not go the right way we think that when you do not pass the bar exam the first time i happen to but i be just lucky i mean my writing be so poor the bar examiner say we have just get to let the guy through we think that when someone dear to we die we think that when we lose an election we think that when we suffer a defeat that all be end we think as t.r. say that the light have leave his life forever
 not true it be only a beginning always the young must know it the old must know it it must always sustain we because the greatness come not when thing go always good for you but the greatness come and you be really test when you take some knock some disappointment when sadness come because only if you have be in the deep valley can you ever know how magnificent it be to be on the high mountain
 and so i say to you on this occasion as we leave we leave proud of the people who have stand by we and work for we and serve this country
 we want you to be proud of what you have do we want you to continue to serve in government if that be your wish always give your good never get discourage never be petty always remember other may hate you but those who hate you do not win unless you hate they and then you destroy yourself
 and so we leave with high hope in good spirit and with deep humility and with very much gratefulness in our heart i can only say to each and every one of you we come from many faith we pray perhaps to different god but really the same god in a sense but i want to say for each and every one of you not only will we always remember you not only will we always be grateful to you but always you will be in our heart and you will be in our prayer
 thank you very much

i have come to a decision which i feel i should tell you and all of my fellow american citizen as soon as i be certain in my own mind and in my own conscience that it be the right thing to do

 i have learn already in this office that the difficult decision always come to this desk i must admit that many of they do not look at all the same as the hypothetical question that i have answer freely and perhaps too fast on previous occasion

 my customary policy be to try and get all the fact and to consider the opinion of my countryman and to take counsel with my most value friend but these seldom agree and in the end the decision be mine to procrastinate to agonize and to wait for a more favorable turn of event that may never come or more compelling external pressure that may as well be wrong as right be itself a decision of sort and a weak and potentially dangerous course for a president to follow

 i have promise to uphold the constitution to do what be right as god give i to see the right and to do the very good that i can for america

 i have ask your help and your prayer not only when i become president but many time since the constitution be the supreme law of our land and it govern our action as citizen only the law of god which govern our conscience be superior to it

 as we be a nation under god so i be swear to uphold our law with the help of god and i have seek such guidance and search my own conscience with special diligence to determine the right thing for i to do with respect to my predecessor in this place richard nixon and his loyal wife and family

 theirs be an american tragedy in which we all have play a part it could go on and on and on or someone must write the end to it i have conclude that only i can do that and if i can i must

 there be no historic or legal precedent to which i can turn in this matter none that precisely fit the circumstance of a private citizen who have resign the presidency of the united states but it be common knowledge that serious allegation and accusation hang like a sword over our former president 's head threaten his health as he try to reshape his life a great part of which be spend in the service of this country and by the mandate of its people

 after year of bitter controversy and divisive national debate i have be advise and i be compel to conclude that many month and perhaps more year will have to pass before richard nixon could obtain a fair trial by jury in any jurisdiction of the united states under govern decision of the supreme court

 i deeply believe in equal justice for all americans whatever their station or former station the law whether human or divine be no respecter of person but the law be a respecter of reality

 the fact as i see they be that a former president of the united states instead of enjoy equal treatment with any other citizen accuse of violate the law would be cruelly and excessively penalize either in preserve the presumption of his innocence or in obtain a speedy determination of his guilt in order to repay a legal debt to society

 during this long period of delay and potential litigation ugly passion would again be arouse and our people would again be polarize in their opinion and the credibility of our free institution of government would again be challenge at home and abroad

 in the end the court might well hold that richard nixon have be deny due process and the verdict of history would even more be inconclusive with respect to those charge arise out of the period of his presidency of which i be presently aware

 but it be not the ultimate fate of richard nixon that most concern i though surely it deeply trouble every decent and every compassionate person my concern be the immediate future of this great country

 in this i dare not depend upon my personal sympathy as a long time friend of the former president nor my professional judgment as a lawyer and i do not

 as president my primary concern must always be the great good of all the people of the united states whose servant i be as a man my first consideration be to be true to my own conviction and my own conscience

 my conscience tell i clearly and certainly that i can not prolong the bad dream that continue to reopen a chapter that be close my conscience tell i that only i as president have the constitutional power to firmly shut and seal this book my conscience tell i it be my duty not merely to proclaim domestic tranquillity but to use every mean that i have to insure it

 i do believe that the buck stop here that i can not rely upon public opinion poll to tell i what be right

 i do believe that right make might and that if i be wrong 10 angel swear i be right would make no difference

 i do believe with all my heart and mind and spirit that i not as president but as a humble servant of god will receive justice without mercy if i fail to show mercy

 finally i feel that richard nixon and his loved one have suffer enough and will continue to suffer no matter what i do no matter what we as a great and good nation can do together to make his goal of peace come true

 now therefore i gerald r. ford president of the united states pursuant to the pardon power confer upon i by article ii section 2 of the constitution have grant and by these present do grant a full free and absolute pardon unto richard nixon for all offense against the united states which he richard nixon have commit or may have commit or take part in during the period from july january 20 1969 through august 9 1974

 in witness whereof i have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of september in the year of our lord nineteen hundred and seventy four and of the independence of the united states of america the one hundred and ninety ninth





good morning

 in my first week as president i ask the attorney general and the secretary of defense to report to i after consultation with other governmental official and private citizen concern on the status of those young americans who have be convict charge investigate or be still be seek as draft evader or military deserter

 on august 19 at the national convention of veterans of foreign wars in the city of chicago i announce my intention to give these young people a chance to earn their return to the mainstream of american society so that they can if they choose contribute even though belatedly to the building and the betterment of our country and the world

 i do this for the simple reason that for american fighting man the long and divisive war in vietnam have be over for more than a year and i be determine then as now to do everything in my power to bind up the nation 's wound

 i promise to throw the weight of my presidency into the scale of justice on the side of leniency and mercy but i promise also to work within the exist system of military and civilian law and the precedent set by my predecessor who face similar postwar situation among they presidents abraham lincoln and harry s. truman

 my objective of make future penalty fit the seriousness of each individual 's offense and of mitigate punishment already mete out in a spirit of equity have prove an immensely hard and very complicated matter even more difficult than i know it would be

 but the agency of government concern and my own staff have work with i literally night and day in order to develop fair and orderly procedure and complete their work for my final approval over this last weekend

 i do not want to delay another day in resolve the dilemma of the past so that we may all get go on the press problem of the present therefore i be today sign the necessary presidential proclamation and executive order that will put this plan into effect

 the program provide for administrative disposition of case involve draft evader and military deserter not yet convict or punish in such case 24 month of alternate service will be require which may be reduce for mitigate circumstance

 the program also deal with case of those already convict by a civilian or military court for the latter purpose i be establish a clemency review board of nine distinguished americans whose duty it will be to assist i in assure that the government 's forgiveness be extend to applicable case of prior conviction as equitably and as impartially as be humanly possible

 the primary purpose of this program be the reconciliation of all our people and the restoration of the essential unity of americans within which honest difference of opinion do not descend to angry discord and mutual problem be not polarize by excessive passion

 my sincere hope be that this be a constructive step toward a calm and cooler appreciation of our individual right and responsibility and our common purpose as a nation whose future be always more important than its past

 at this point i will sign the proclamation 4313 that i mention in my statement follow by an executive order 11803 for the establishment of the clemency board follow by the signing of an executive order 11804 for the director of selective service who will have a prime responsibility in the handling of the matter involve alternate service

 thank you very much

mr. president mr. secretary general your excellencies

 in 1946 president harry truman welcome representative of 55 nation to the first general assembly of the united nations since then every american president have have the great honor of address this assembly

 today with pleasure and humility i take my turn in welcome you the distinguished representative of 138 nation when i take office i tell the american people that my remark would be just a little straight talk among friend straight talk be what i propose here today in the first of my address to the representative of the world

 next week secretary of state henry kissinger will present in specific the overall principle which i will outline in my remark today it should be emphatically understand that the secretary of state have my full support and the unquestioned backing of the american people

 as a party leader in the congress of the united states as vice president and now as president of the united states of america i have have the close working relationship with secretary of state kissinger i have support and will continue to endorse his many effort as secretary of state and in our national security council system to build a world of peace

 since the united nations be rounded the world have experience conflict and threat to peace but we have avoid the great danger another world war today we have the opportunity to make the remainder of this century an era of peace and cooperation and economic well being

 the harsh hostility which once hold great power in their rigid grasp have now begin to moderate many of the crisis which dominate past general assemblies be fortunately behind we and technological progress hold out the hope that one day all man can achieve a decent life

 nation too often have have no choice but to be either hammer or anvil to strike or to be strike now we have a new opportunity to forge in concert with other a framework of international cooperation that be the course the united states have choose for itself

 on behalf of the american people i renew these basic pledge to you today

 --we be commit to a pursuit of a more peaceful stable and cooperative world while we be determined never to be best in a test of strength we will devote our strength to what be good and in the nuclear era there be no rational alternative to accord of mutual restraint between the united states and the soviet union two nation which have the power to destroy mankind

 --we will bolster our partnership with traditional friend in europe asia and latin america to meet new challenge in a rapidly change world the maintenance of such relationship underpin rather than undercut the search for peace

 --we will seek out we will expand our relation with old adversary for example our new rapport with the people 's republic of china well serve the purpose of each nation and the interest of the entire world

 --we will strive to heal old wound reopen in recent conflict in cyprus the middle east and in indochina peace can not be impose from without but we will do whatever be within our capacity to help achieve it

 --we rededicate ourselves to the search for justice equality and freedom recent development in africa signal the welcome end of colonialism behavior appropriate to an era of dependence must give way to the new responsibility of an era of interdependence

 no single nation no single group of nation no single organization can meet all of the challenge before the community of nation we must act in concert progress toward a well world must come through cooperative effort across the whole range of bilateral and multilateral relation

 america 's revolutionary birth and century of experience in adjust democratic government to change condition have make americans practical as well as idealistic as idealist we be proud of our role in the founding of the united nations and in support its many accomplishment as practical people we be sometimes impatient at what we see as shortcoming

 in my 25 year as a member of the congress of the united states i learn two basic practical lesson

 first man of differ political persuasion can find common ground for cooperation we need not agree on all issue in order to agree on most difference of principle of purpose of perspective will not disappear but neither will our mutual problem disappear unless we be determined to find mutually helpful solution

 second a majority must take into account the proper interest of a minority if the decision of the majority be to be accept we who believe in and live by majority rule must always be alert to the danger of the tyranny of the majority majority rule thrive on the habit of accommodation moderation and consideration of the interest of other

 a very stark reality have temper america 's action for decade and must now temper the action of all nation prevention of full scale warfare in the nuclear age have become everybody 's responsibility today 's regional conflict must not become tomorrow 's world disaster we must assure by every mean at our disposal that local crisis be quickly contain and resolve

 the challenge before the united states nations be very clear this organization can place the weight of the world community on the side of world peace and this organization can provide impartial force to maintain the peace

 and at this point i wish to pay tribute on behalf of the american people to the 37 member of the united nations peacekeeping force who have give their life in the middle east and in cyprus in the past 10 month and i convey our deep sympathy to their loved one

 let the quality of our response measure up to the magnitude of the challenge that we face i pledge to you that america will continue to be constructive innovative and responsive to the work of this great body

 the nation in this hall be unite by a deep concern for peace we be unite as well by our desire to ensure a well life for all people

 today the economy of the world be under unprecedented stress we need new approach to international cooperation to respond effectively to the problem that we face develop and developed country market and nonmarket country we be all a part of one interdependent economic system

 the food and oil crisis demonstrate the extent of our interdependence many develop nation need the food surplus of a few develop nation and many industrialized nation need the oil production of a few develop nation

 energy be require to produce food and food to produce energy and both to provide a decent life for everyone the problem of food and energy can be resolve on the basis of cooperation or can i should say be make unmanageable on the basis of confrontation runaway inflation propel by food and oil price increase be an early warning signal to all of we

 let we not delude ourselves failure to cooperate on oil and food and inflation could spell disaster for every nation represent in this room the united nations must not and need not allow this to occur a global strategy for food and energy be urgently require

 the united states believe four principle should guide a global approach first all nation must substantially increase production just to maintain the present standard of live the world must almost double its output of food and energy to match the expect increase in the world 's population by the end of this century to meet aspiration for a well life production will have to expand at a significantly fast rate than population growth

 second all nation must seek to achieve a level of price which not only provide an incentive to producer but which consumer can afford it should now be clear that the develop nation be not the only country which demand and receive an adequate return for their good but it should also be clear that by confront consumer with production restriction artificial pricing and the prospect of ultimate bankruptcy producer will eventually become the victim of their own action

 third all nation must avoid the abuse of man 's fundamental need for the sake of narrow national or bloc advantage the attempt by any nation to use one commodity for political purpose will inevitably tempt other country to use their commodity for their own purpose

 fourth the nation of the world must assure that the poor among we be not overwhelm by rise price of the import necessary for their survival the traditional aid donor and the increasingly wealthy oil producer must join in this effort

 the united states recognize the special responsibility we bear as the world 's large producer of food that be why secretary of state kissinger propose from this very podium last year a world food conference to define a global food policy and that be one reason why we have remove domestic restriction on food production in the united states

 it have not be our policy to use food as a political weapon despite the oil embargo and recent oil price and production decision

 it would be tempting for the united states beset by inflation and soar energy price to turn a deaf ear to external appeal for food assistance or to respond with internal appeal for export control but however difficult our own economic situation we recognize that the plight of other be bad

 americans have always respond to human emergency in the past and we respond again here today in response to secretary general waldheim 's appeal and to help meet the long term challenge in food i reiterate to help develop nation realize their aspiration to grow more of their own food the united states will substantially increase its assistance to agricultural production program in other country

 next to ensure that the survival of million of our fellow man do not depend upon the vagary of weather the united states be prepared to join in a worldwide effort to negotiate establish and maintain an international system of food reserve this system will work well if each nation be make responsible for manage the reserve that it will have available

 finally to make certain that the more immediate need for food be meet this year the united states will not only maintain the amount it spend for food shipment to nation in need but it will increase this amount this year

 thus the united states be strive to help define and help contribute to a cooperative global policy to meet man 's immediate and long term need for food we will set forth our comprehensive proposal at the world food conference in november

 now be the time for oil producer to define their conception of a global policy on energy to meet the grow need and to do this without impose unacceptable burden on the international monetary and trade system

 a world of economic confrontation can not be a world of political cooperation if we fail to satisfy man 's fundamental need for energy and food we face a threat not just to our aspiration for a well life for all our people but to our hope for a more stable and a more peaceful world by work together to overcome our common problem mankind can turn from fear towards hope

 from the time of the founding of the united nations america volunteer to help nation in need frequently as the main benefactor we be able to do it we be glad to do it but as new economic force alter and reshape today 's complex world no nation can be expect to feed all the world 's hungry people

 fortunately however many nation be increasingly able to help and i call on they to join with we as truly united nation in the struggle to produce to provide more food at low price for the hungry and in general a well life for the needy of this world

 america will continue to do more than its share but there be realistic limit to our capacity there be no limit however to our determination to act in concert with other nation to fulfill the vision of the united nations charter to save succeed generation from the scourge of war and to promote social progress and well standard well standard of life in a large freedom

 thank you very very much

mr. speaker mr. president distinguished guest my very dear friend
 in his first inaugural address president franklin d. roosevelt say and i quote the people of the united states have not fail they want direct vigorous action and they have ask for discipline and direction under our leadership
 today though our economic difficulty do not approach the emergency of 1933 the message from the american people be exactly the same i trust that you be get the very same message that i be receive our constituent want leadership our constituent want action
 all of we have hear much talk on this very floor about congress recover its rightful share of national leadership i now intend to offer you that chance
 the 73d congress respond to fdr 's appeal in five day i be deeply grateful for the cooperation of the 93d congress and the conference on inflation which end ten day ago
 mr. speaker many but not all of your recommendation on behalf of your party 's caucus be reflect in some of my proposal here today the distinguished majority leader of the senate offer a nine point program i seriously study all of they and adopt some of his suggestion
 i might add i have also listen very hard to many of our former colleague in both body and of both the majority and the minority and have be both persuade and dissuade but in the end i have to make the decision i have to decide as each of you do when the roll call be call
 i will not take your time today with the discussion of the origin of inflation and its bad effect on the united states but i do know where we want to be in 1976 on the 200th birthday of a united states of america that have not lose its way nor its will nor its sense of national purpose
 during the meeting on inflation i listen carefully to many valuable suggestion since the summit i have evaluate literally hundred of idea day and night
 my conclusion be very simply state there be only one point on which all adviser have agree we must whip inflation right now
 none of the remedy propose great or small compulsory or voluntary stand a chance unless they be combine in a consider package in a concerted effort in a grand design
 i have review the past and the present effort of our federal government to help the economy they be simply not good enough nor sufficiently broad nor do they pack the punch that will turn america 's economy on
 a stable american economy can not be sustain if the world 's economy be in chaos international cooperation be absolutely essential and vital but while we seek agreement with other nation let we put our own economic house in order today i have identify 10 area for our joint action the executive and the legislative branch of our government
 number one food america be the world 's champion producer of food food price and petroleum price in the united states be primary inflationary factor america today partially depend on foreign source for petroleum but we can grow more than enough food for ourselves
 to halt high food price we must produce more food and i call upon every farmer to produce to full capacity and i say to you and to the farmer they have do a magnificent job in the past and we should be eternally grateful
 this government however will do all in its power to assure he that farmer he can sell his entire yield at reasonable price accordingly i ask the congress to remove all remain acreage limitation on rice peanut and cotton
 i also assure america 's farmer here and now that i will allocate all the fuel and ask authority to allocate all the fertilizer they need to do this essential job
 agricultural marketing order and other federal regulation be be review to eliminate or modify those responsible for inflated price
 i have direct our new council on wage and price stability to find and to expose all restrictive practice public or private which raise food price the administration will also monitor food production margin pricing and export we can and we shall have an adequate supply at home and through cooperation meet the need of our trading partner abroad
 over this past weekend we initiate a voluntary program to monitor grain export the economic policy board will be responsible for determine the policy under this program
 in addition in order to well allocate our supply for export i ask that a provision be add to public law 480 under which we ship food to the needy and friendly country the president need authority to waive certain of the restriction on shipment base on national interest or humanitarian ground
 number two energy america 's future depend heavily on oil gas coal electricity and other resource call energy make no mistake we do have a real energy problem
 one third of our oil—17 percent of america 's total energy now come from foreign source that we can not control at high cartel price cost you and i $ 16 billion—$16 billion more than just a year ago
 the primary solution have to be at home if you have forget the shortage of last winter most americans have not i have order today the reorganization of our national energy effort and the creation of a national energy board it will be chair with develop or i should say charge with develop a single national energy policy and program and i think most of you will be glad to know that our former colleague rog morton our secretary of interior will be the overall boss of our national energy program
 rog morton 's marching order be to reduce import of foreign oil by 1 million barrel per day by the end of 1975 whether by saving here at home or by increase our own source
 secretary morton along with his other responsibility be also charge with increase our domestic energy supply by promptly utilize our coal resource and expand recovery of domestic oil still in the ground in old well
 new legislation will be seek after your recess to require use of clean coal process and nuclear fuel in new electric plant and the quick conversion of exist oil plant i propose that we together set a target date of 1980 for eliminate oil fire plant from the nation 's base load electrical capacity
 i will use the defense production act to allocate scarce material for energy development and i will ask you the house and senate for whatever amendment prove necessary
 i will meet with top management of the automobile industry to assure either by agreement or by law a firm program aim at achieve a 40 percent increase in gasoline mileage within a 4 year development deadline
 priority legislation action i should say to increase energy supply here at home require the follow
 one long seek deregulation of natural gas supply
 number two responsible use of our naval petroleum reserve in california and alaska
 number three amendment to the clean air act and
 four passage of surface mining legislation to ensure an adequate supply with commonsense environmental protection
 now if all of these step fail to meet our current energy save goal i will not hesitate to ask for tough measure for the long range we must work hard on coal gasification we must push with renew vigor and talent research in the use of nonfossil fuel the power of the atom the heat of the sun and the steam store deep in the earth the force of the wind and water must be main source of energy for our grandchild and we can do it
 number three restrictive practice to increase productivity and contain price we must end restrictive and costly practice whether institute by government industry labor or other and i be determined to return to the vigorous enforcement of antitrust law
 the administration will zero in on more effective enforcement of law against price fixing and bid rigging for instance non competitive professional fee schedule and real estate settlement fee must be eliminate such violation will be prosecute by the department of justice to the full extent of the law
 now i ask congress for prompt authority to increase maximum penalty for antitrust violation from $ 50,000 to $ 1 million for corporation and from $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 for individual violator
 at the conference on inflation we find i would say very broad agreement that the federal government impose too many hidden and too many inflationary cost on our economy as a result i propose a four point program aim at a substantial purging process
 number one i have order the council on wage and price stability to be the watchdog over inflationary cost of all governmental action
 two i ask the congress to establish a national commission on regulatory reform to undertake a long overdue total reexamination of the independent regulatory agency it will be a joint effort by the congress the executive branch and the private sector to identify and eliminate exist federal rule and regulation that increase cost to the consumer without any good reason in today 's economic climate
 three hereafter i will require that all major legislative proposal regulation and rule emanate from the executive branch of the government will include an inflation impact statement that certifie we have carefully weigh the effect on the nation i respectfully request that the congress require a similar advance inflation impact statement for its own legislative initiative
 finally i urge state and local unit of government to undertake similar program to reduce inflationary effect of their regulatory activity
 at this point i thank the congress for recently revitalize the national commission on productivity and work quality it will initially concentrate on problem of productivity in government federal state and local outside of government it will develop meaningful blueprint for labor management cooperation at the plant level it should look particularly at the construction and the health service industry
 the council on wage and price stability will of course monitor wage and price increase in the private sector monitoring will include public hearing to justify either price or wage increase i emphasize in fact reemphasize that this be not a compulsory wage and price control agency
 now i know many americans see federal control as the answer but i believe from past experience control show we that they never really stop inflation not the last time not even during and immediately after world war ii when as i recall price rise despite severe and enforceable wartime rationing
 now peacetime control actually we know from recent experience create shortage hamper production stifle growth and limit job i do not ask for such power however politically tempting as such a program could cause the fixer and the black marketeer to flourish while decent citizen face empty shelf and stand in long waiting line
 number four we need more capital we can not eat up our seed corn our free enterprise system depend on orderly capital market through which the saving of our people become productively use today our capital market be in total disarray we must restore their vitality prudent monetary restraint be essential
 you and the american people should know however that i have personally be assure by the chairman of the independent federal reserve board that the supply of money and credit will expand sufficiently to meet the need of our economy and that in no event will a credit crunch occur
 the prime lending rate be go down to help industry to buy more machine and create more job i be recommend a liberalized 10 percent investment tax credit this credit should be especially helpful to capital intensive industry such as primary metal public utility where capacity shortage have develop
 i be ask congress to enact tax legislation to provide that all dividend on preferred stock issue for cash be fully deductible by the issue company this should bring in more capital especially for energy produce utility it will also help other industry shift from debt to equity provide a sounder capital structure
 capital gain tax legislation must be liberalize as propose by the tax reform bill currently before the committee on ways and means i endorse this approach and hope that it will pass promptly
 number five help the casualty and this be a very important part of the overall speech the conference on inflation make everybody even more aware of who be suffer most from inflation foremost be those who be jobless through no fault of their own
 three week ago i release fund which with early action provide public service employment for some 170,000 who need work i now propose to the congress a two step program to augment this action
 first 13 week of special unemployment insurance benefit would be provide to those who have exhaust their regular and extended unemployment insurance benefit and 26 week of special unemployment insurance benefit to those who qualify but be not now cover by regular unemployment insurance program funding in this case would come from the general treasury not from taxis on employer as be the case with the establish unemployment program
 second i ask the congress to create a brand new community improvement corps to provide work for the unemployed through short term useful work project to improve beautify and enhance the environment of our city our town and our countryside
 this standby program would come alive whenever unemployment exceed 6 percent nationally it would be stop when unemployment drop below 6 percent local labor market would each qualify for grant whenever their unemployment rate exceed 6.5 percent
 state and local government contractor would supervise these project and could hire only those who have exhaust their unemployment insurance benefit the goal of this new program be to provide more constructive work for all americans young or old who can not find a job
 the purpose really follow this formula short term problem require short term remedy i therefore request that these program be for a 1 year period
 now i know that low- and middle income americans have be hard hit by inflation their budget be most vulnerable because a large part of their income go for the highly inflate cost of food fuel and medical care
 the tax reform bill now in the house committee on ways and means which i favor already provide approximately $ 1.6 billion of tax relief to these group compensate new revenue be provide in this prospective legislation by a windfall tax profit tax on oil producer and by close other loophole if enact this will be a major contribution by the congress in our common effort to make our tax system fair to all
 number six stimulate housing without question credit be the lifeblood of housing the united states unfortunately be suffer the long and the most severe housing recession since the end of world war ii unemployment in the construction trade be twice the national average
 one of my first act as president be to sign the housing and community development act of 1974 i have since conclude that still more help be need help that can be deliver very quickly and with minimum inflationary impact
 i urge the congress to enact before recess additional legislation to make most home mortgage eligible for purchase by an agency of the federal government as the law stand now only fha or va home mortgage one fifth of the total be cover
 i be very glad that the senate thank to the leadership of senator brooke and senator cranston have already make substantial progress on this legislation as soon as it come to i i will make at least $ 3 billion immediately available for mortgage purchase enough to finance about 100,000 more american home
 number seven thrift institution saving and loan and similar institution be hard hit by inflation and high interest rate they no long attract unfortunately adequate deposit the executive branch in my judgment must join with the congress in give critically need attention to the structure and the operation of our thrift institution which now find themselves for the third time in 8 year in another period of serious mortgage credit scarcity
 passage of the pende financial institution bill will help but no single measure have yet appear as i see it to solve feast or famine in mortgage credit however i promise to work with you individually and collectively to develop additional specific program in this area in the future
 number eight international interdependency the united states have a responsibility not only to maintain a healthy economy at home but also to seek policy which complement rather than disrupt the constructive effort of other
 essential to u.s. initiative be the early passage of an acceptable trade reform bill my special representative for trade negotiations depart early this afternoon to canada europe japan to brief foreign friend on my proposal
 we live in an interdependent world and therefore must work together to resolve common economic problem
 number nine federal taxis and spending to support program to increase production and share inflation produce hardship we need additional tax revenue
 i be aware that any proposal for new taxis just four week before a national election be to put it mildly consider politically unwise and i be frank to say that i have be earnestly advise to wait and talk about taxis anytime after november 5 but i do say in sincerity that i will not play politic with america 's future
 our present inflation to a considerable degree come from many year of enact expensive program without raise enough revenue to pay for they the truth be that 19 out of the 25 year i have the honor and the privilege to serve in this chamber the federal government end up with federal deficit that be not a very good batting average
 by now almost everybody almost everybody else i should say have state my position on federal gasoline taxis this time i will do it myself i be not emphasize not ask you for any increase in gas taxis
 i be i be ask you to approve a l year temporary tax surcharge of 5 percent on corporate and upper level individual income this would generally exclude from the surcharge those family with gross income below $ 15,000 a year the estimated $ 5 billion in extra revenue to be raise by this inflation fight tax should pay for the new program i have recommend in this message
 i think and i suspect each of you know this be the acid test of our joint determination to whip inflation in america i would not ask this if major loophole be not now be close by the committee on ways and means tax reform bill
 i urge you to join i before your recess in addition to what i have say before to join i by vote to set a target spending limit let i emphasize it a target spend limit of $ 300 billion for the federal fiscal budget of 1975
 when congress agree to this spending target i will submit a package of budget deferral and rescission to meet this goal i will do the tough job of designate for congressional action on your return those area which i believe can and must be reduce these will be hard choice and every one of you in this chamber know it as well as i. they will be hard choice but no federal agency include the defense department will be untouchable
 it be my judgment that fiscal discipline be a necessary weapon in any fight against inflation while this spending target be a small step it be a step in the right direction and we need to get on that course without any further delay i do not think that any of we in this chamber today can ask the american people to tighten their belt if uncle sam be unwilling to tighten his belt first
 and now if i might i would like to say a few word directly to your constituent and incidentally mine
 my fellow americans 10 day ago i ask you to get thing start by make a list of 10 way to fight inflation and save energy to exchange your list with your neighbor and to send i a copy
 i have personally read score of the thousand of letter receive at the white house and incidentally i have make my economic expert read some of they too we all benefit at least i do and i thank each and every one of you for this cooperation
 some of the good idea from your home to mine have be crank into the recommendation i have just make to the congress and the step i be take as president to whip inflation right now there be also firm warning on what government must not do and i appreciate those too your good suggestion for voluntary restraint and self discipline show i that a great degree of patriotic determination and unanimity already exist in this great land
 i have ask congress for urgent specific action it alone can take i advise congress of the initial step that i be take as president here be what only you can do unless every able american pitch in congress and i can not do the job win our fight against inflation and waste involve total mobilization of america 's great resource the brain the skill and the willpower of the american people
 here be what we must do what each and every one of you can do to help increase food and low price grow more and waste less to help save scarce fuel in the energy crisis drive less heat less every housewife know almost exactly how much she spend for food last week if you can not spare a penny from your food budget and i know there be many surely you can cut the food that you waste by 5 percent
 every american motorist know exactly how many mile he or she drive to work or to school every day and about how much mileage she or he run up each year if we all drive at least 5 percent few mile we can save almost unbelievably 250,000 barrel of foreign oil per day by the end of 1975 most of we can do well than 5 percent by carpooling take the bus ride bike or just plain walking we can save enough gas by self discipline to meet our 1 million barrel per day goal
 i think there be one final thing that all americans can do rich or poor and that be share with other we can share burden as we can share blessing sharing be not easy not easy to measure like mileage and family budget but i be sure that 5 percent more be not nearly enough to ask so i ask you to share everything you can and a little bit more and it will strengthen our spirit as well as our economy
 today i will not take more of the time of this busy congress for i vividly remember the rush before every recess and the clock be already run on my specific and urgent request for legislative action i also remember how much congress can get do when it put its shoulder to the wheel
 one week from tonight i have a long stand invitation in kansas city to address the future farmers of america a fine organization of wonderful young people whose help with million of other be vital in this battle i will elaborate then how volunteer inflation fighter and energy saver can far mobilize their total effort
 since ask miss sylvia porter the well know financial writer to help i organize an all out nationwide volunteer mobilization i have name a white house coordinator and have enlist the enthusiastic support and service of some 17 other distinguished americans to help plan for citizen and private group participation
 there will be no big federal bureaucracy set up for this crash program through the courtesy of such volunteer from the communication and medium field a very simple enlistment form will appear in many of tomorrow 's newspaper along with the symbol of this new mobilization which i be wear on my lapel it bear the single word win i think that tell it all i will call upon every american to join in this massive mobilization and stick with it until we do win as a nation and as a people
 mr. speaker and mr. president i stand on a spot hallow by history many president have come here many time to solicit to scold to flatter to exhort the congress to support they in their leadership once in a great while president have stand here and truly inspire the most skeptical and the most sophisticated audience of their co equal partner in government perhaps once or twice in a generation be there such a joint session i do not expect this one to be
 only two of my predecessor have come in person to call upon congress for a declaration of war and i shall not do that but i say to you with all sincerity that our inflation our public enemy number one will unless whip destroy our country our home our liberty our property and finally our national pride as surely as any well arm wartime enemy
 i concede there will be no sudden pearl harbor to shock we into unity and to sacrifice but i think we have have enough early warning the time to intercept be right now the time to intercept be almost go
 my friend and former colleague will you enlist now my friend and fellow americans will you enlist now together with discipline and determination we will win
 i thank you very much
