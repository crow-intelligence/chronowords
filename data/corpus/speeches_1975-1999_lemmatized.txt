mr. speaker mr. vice president member of the 94th congress and distinguished guest

 twenty six year ago a freshman congressman a young fellow with lot of idealism who be out to change the world stand before sam rayburn in the well of the house and solemnly swear to the same oath that all of you take yesterday an unforgettable experience and i congratulate you all

 two day later that same freshman stand at the back of this great chamber over there someplace as president truman all charge up by his single handed election victory report as the constitution require on the state of the union

 when the bipartisan applause stop president truman say i be happy to report to this 81st congress that the state of the union be good our nation be well able than ever before to meet the need of the american people and to give they their fair chance in the pursuit of happiness it be foremost among the nation of the world in the search for peace

 today that freshman member from michigan stand where mr. truman stand and i must say to you that the state of the union be not good million of americans be out of work recession and inflation be erode the money of million more price be too high and sale be too slow

 this year 's federal deficit will be about $ 30 billion next year 's probably $ 45 billion the national debt will rise to over $ 500 billion our plant capacity and productivity be not increase fast enough we depend on other for essential energy

 some people question their government 's ability to make hard decision and stick with they they expect washington politic as usual

 yet what president truman say on january 5 1949 be even more true in 1975 we be well able to meet our people 's need all americans do have a fair chance to pursue happiness not only be we still the foremost nation in the pursuit of peace but today 's prospect of attain it be infinitely brighter

 there be 59 million americans employ at the start of 1949 now there be more than 85 million americans who have job in comparable dollar the average income of the american family have double during the past 26 year

 now i want to speak very bluntly i have get bad news and i do not expect much if any applause the american people want action and it will take both the congress and the president to give they what they want progress and solution can be achieve and they will be achieve

 my message today be not intend to address all of the complex need of america i will send separate message make specific recommendation for domestic legislation such as the extension of general revenue sharing and the voting rights act

 the moment have come to move in a new direction we can do this by fashion a new partnership between the congress on the one hand the white house on the other and the people we both represent

 let we mobilize the most powerful and most creative industrial nation that ever exist on this earth to put all our people to work the emphasis on our economic effort must now shift from inflation to job

 to bolster business and industry and to create new job i propose a one year tax reduction of $ 16 billion three quarter would go to individual and one quarter to promote business investment

 this cash rebate to individual amount to 12 percent of 1974 tax payment a total cut of $ 12 billion with a maximum of $ 1,000 per return

 i call on the congress to act by april 1 if you do and i hope you will the treasury can send the first check for half of the rebate in may and the second by september

 the other one fourth of the cut about $ 4 billion will go to business include farm to promote expansion and to create more job the one year reduction for business would be in the form of a liberalized investment tax credit increase the rate to 12 percent for all business

 this tax cut do not include the more fundamental reform need in our tax system but it point we in the right direction allow taxpayer rather than the government to spend their pay

 cut taxis now be essential if we be to turn the economy around a tax cut offer the good hope of create more job unfortunately it will increase the size of the budget deficit therefore it be more important than ever that we take step to control the growth of federal expenditure

 part of our trouble be that we have be self indulgent for decade we have be vote ever increase level of government benefit and now the bill have come due we have be add so many new program that the size and the growth of the federal budget have take on a life of its own

 one characteristic of these program be that their cost increase automatically every year because the number of people eligible for most of the benefit increase every year when these program be enact there be no dollar amount set no one know what they will cost all we know be that whatever they cost last year they will cost more next year

 it be a question of simple arithmetic unless we check the excessive growth of federal expenditure or impose on ourselves matching increase in taxis we will continue to run huge inflationary deficit in the federal budget

 if we project the current build in momentum of federal spending through the next 15 year state federal and local government expenditure could easily comprise half of our gross national product this compare with less than a third in 1975

 i have just conclude the process of prepare the budget submission for fiscal year 1976 in that budget i will propose legislation to restrain the growth of a number of exist program i have also conclude that no new spending program can be initiate this year except for energy far i will not hesitate to veto any new spending program adopt by the congress

 as an additional step toward put the federal government 's house in order i recommend a 5 percent limit on federal pay increase in 1975 in all government program tie to the consumer price index include social security civil service and military retirement pay and food stamp i also propose a one year maximum increase of 5 percent

 none of these recommend ceiling limitation over which congress have final authority be easy to propose because in most case they involve anticipate payment to many many deserve people nonetheless it must be do i must emphasize that i be not ask to eliminate to reduce to freeze these payment i be merely recommend that we slow down the rate at which these payment increase and these program grow

 only a reduction in the growth of spending can keep federal borrowing down and reduce the damage to the private sector from high interest rate only a reduction in spending can make it possible for the federal reserve system to avoid an inflationary growth in the money supply and thus restore balance to our economy a major reduction in the growth of federal spending can help dispel the uncertainty that so many feel about our economy and put we on the way to cure our economic ill

 if we do not act to slow down the rate of increase in federal spending the united states treasury will be legally obligate to spend more than $ 360 billion in fiscal year 1976 even if no new program be enact these be not matter of conjecture or prediction but again a matter of simple arithmetic the size of these number and their implication for our everyday life and the health of our economic system be shocking

 i submit to the last congress a list of budget deferral and rescission there will be more cut recommend in the budget that i will submit even so the level of outlay for fiscal year 1976 be still much much too high not only be it too high for this year but the decision we make now will inevitably have a major and grow impact on expenditure level in future year i think this be a very fundamental issue that we the congress and i must jointly solve

 economic disruption we and other be experience stem in part from the fact that the world price of petroleum have quadruple in the last year but in all honesty we can not put all of the blame on the oil export nation we the united states be not blameless our grow dependence upon foreign source have be add to our vulnerability for year and year and we do nothing to prepare ourselves for such an event as the embargo of 1973

 during the 1960 this country have a surplus capacity of crude oil which we be able to make available to our trading partner whenever there be a disruption of supply this surplus capacity enable we to influence both supply and price of crude oil throughout the world our excess capacity neutralize any effort at establish an effective cartel and thus the rest of the world be assure of adequate supply of oil at reasonable price

 by 1970 our surplus capacity have vanish and as a consequence the latent power of the oil cartel could emerge in full force europe and japan both heavily dependent on import oil now struggle to keep their economy in balance even the united states our country which be far more self sufficient than most other industrial country have be .put under serious pressure

 i be propose a program which will begin to restore our country 's surplus capacity in total energy in this way we will be able to assure ourselves reliable and adequate energy and help foster a new world energy stability for other major consume nation

 but this nation and in fact the world must face the prospect of energy difficulty between now and 1985 this program will impose burden on all of we with the aim of reduce our consumption of energy and increase our production great attention have be pay to the consideration of fairness and i can assure you that the burden will not fall more harshly on those less able to bear they

 i be recommend a plan to make we invulnerable to cutoff of foreign oil it will require sacrifice but it and this be most important it will work

 i have set the follow national energy goal to assure that our future be as secure and as productive as our past

 first we must reduce oil import by one million barrel per day by the end of this year and by two million barrel per day by the end of 1977

 second we must end vulnerability to economic disruption by foreign supplier by 1985

 third we must develop our energy technology and resource so that the united states have the ability to supply a significant share of the energy need of the free world by the end of this century

 to attain these objective we need immediate action to cut import unfortunately in the short term there be only a limited number of action which can increase domestic supply i will press for all of they

 i urge quick action on the necessary legislation to allow commercial production at the elk hills california naval petroleum reserve in order that we make great use of domestic coal resource i be submit amendment to the energy supply and environmental coordination act which will greatly increase the number of powerplant that can be promptly convert to coal

 obviously voluntary conservation continue to be essential but tough program be need and need now therefore i be use presidential power to raise the fee on all import crude oil and petroleum product the crude oil fee level will be increase $ 1 per barrel on february 1 by $ 2 per barrel on march 1 and by $ 3 per barrel on april 1 i will take action to reduce undue hardship on any geographical region the foregoing be interim administrative action they will be rescind when the broad but necessary legislation be enact

 to that end i be request the congress to act within 90 day on a more comprehensive energy tax program it include excise taxis and import fee total $ 2 per barrel on product import and on all crude oil deregulation of new natural gas and enactment of a natural gas excise tax

 i plan to take presidential initiative to decontrol the price of domestic crude oil on april 1 i urge the congress to enact a windfall profit tax by that date to ensure that oil producer do not profit unduly

 the soon congress act the more effective the oil conservation program will be and the quick the federal revenue can be return to our people

 i be prepared to use presidential authority to limit import as necessary to guarantee success

 i want you to know that before decide on my energy conservation program i consider rationing and high gasoline taxis as alternative in my judgment neither would achieve the desire result and both would produce unacceptable inequity

 a massive program must be initiate to increase energy supply to cut demand and provide new standby emergency program to achieve the independence we want by 1985 the large part of increase oil production must come from new frontier area on the outer continental shelf and from the naval petroleum reserve no 4 in alaska it be the intent of this administration to move ahead with exploration leasing and production on those frontier area of the outer continental shelf where the environmental risk be acceptable

 use of our most abundant domestic resource coal be severely limited we must strike a reasonable compromise on environmental concern with coal i be submit clean air act amendment which will allow great coal use without sacrifice clean air goal

 i veto the strip mining legislation pass by the last congress with appropriate change i will sign a revise version when it come to the white house

 i be propose a number of action to energize our nuclear power program i will submit legislation to expedite nuclear leasing licensing and the rapid selection of site

 in recent month utility have cancel or postpone over 60 percent of plan nuclear expansion and 30 percent of plan addition to non nuclear capacity financing problem for that industry be worsen i be therefore recommend that the one year investment tax credit of 12 percent be extend an additional two year to specifically speed the construction of powerplant that do not use natural gas or oil i be also submit proposal for selective reform of state utility commission regulation

 to provide the critical stability for our domestic energy production in the face of world price uncertainty i will request legislation to authorize and require tariff import quota or price floor to protect our energy price at level which will achieve energy independence

 increase energy supply be not enough we must take additional step to cut long term consumption i therefore propose to the congress legislation to make thermal efficiency standard mandatory for all new building in the united states a new tax credit of up to $ 150 for those homeowner who install insulation equipment the establishment of an energy conservation program to help low income family purchase insulation supply legislation to modify and defer automotive pollution standard for five year which will enable we to improve automobile gas mileage by 40 percent by 1980

 these proposal and action cumulatively can reduce our dependence on foreign energy supply from three to five million barrel per day by 1985 to make the united states invulnerable to foreign disruption i propose standby emergency legislation and a strategic storage program of one billion barrel of oil for domestic need and 300 million barrel for national defense purpose

 i will ask for the fund need for energy research and development activity i have establish a goal of one million barrel of synthetic fuel and shale oil production per day by 1985 together with an incentive program to achieve it

 i have a very deep belief in america 's capability within the next 10 year my program envision 200 major nuclear powerplant 250 major new coal mine 150 major coal fire powerplant 30 major new oil refinery 20 major new synthetic fuel plant the drilling of many thousand of new oil well the insulation of 18 million home and the manufacturing and the sale of million of new automobile truck and bus that use much less fuel

 i happen to believe that we can do it in another crisis the one in 1942 president franklin d. roosevelt say this country would build 60,000 50,000 military aircraft by 1943 production in that program have reach 125,000 aircraft annually they do it then we can do it now

 if the congress and the american people will work with i to attain these target they will be achieve and will be surpass from adversity let we seize opportunity revenue of some $ 30 billion from high energy taxis design to encourage conservation must be refund to the american people in a manner which correct distortion in our tax system work by inflation

 people have be push into high tax bracket by inflation with consequent reduction in their actual spending power business taxis be similarly distort because inflation exaggerate report profit result in excessive taxis

 accordingly i propose that future individual income taxis be reduce by $ 16.5 billion this will be do by raise the low income allowance and reduce tax rate this continue tax cut will primarily benefit lower- and middle income taxpayer

 for example a typical family of four with a gross income of $ 5,600 now pay $ 185 in federal income taxis under this tax cut plan they would pay nothing a family of four with a gross income of $ 12,500 now pay $ 1,260 in federal taxis my proposal reduce that total by $ 300 family gross $ 20,000 would receive a reduction of $ 210

 those with the very low income who can least afford high cost must also be compensate i propose a payment of $ 80 to every person 18 year of age and old in that very limited category

 state and local government will receive $ 2 billion in additional revenue sharing to offset their increase energy cost

 to offset inflationary distortion and to generate more economic activity the corporate tax rate will be reduce from 48 percent to 42 percent

 now let i turn if i might to the international dimension of the present crisis at no time in our peacetime history have the state of the nation depend more heavily on the state of the world and seldom if ever have the state of the world depend more heavily on the state of our nation

 the economic distress be global we will not solve it at home unless we help to remedy the profound economic dislocation abroad world trade and monetary structure provide market energy food and vital raw material for all nation this international system be now in jeopardy

 this nation can be proud of significant achievement in recent year in solve problem and crisis the berlin agreement the salt agreement our new relationship with china the unprecedented effort in the middle east be immensely encouraging but the world be not free from crisis in a world of 150 nation where nuclear technology be proliferate and regional conflict continue international security can not be take for grant

 so let there be no mistake about it international cooperation be a vital factor of our life today this be not a moment for the american people to turn inward more than ever before our own well being depend on america 's determination and america 's leadership in the whole wide world

 we be a great nation spiritually politically militarily diplomatically and economically america 's commitment to international security have sustain the safety of ally and friend in many area in the middle east in europe and in asia our turn away would unleash new instability new danger around the globe which in turn would threaten our own security

 at the end of world war ii we turn a similar challenge into an historic opportunity and i might add an historic achievement an old order be in disarray political and economic institution be shatter in that period this nation and its partner build new institution new mechanism of mutual support and cooperation today as then we face an historic opportunity if we act imaginatively and boldly as we act then this period will in retrospect be see as one of the great creative moment of our nation 's history the whole world be watch to see how we respond

 a resurgent american economy would do more to restore the confidence of the world in its own future than anything else we can do the program that this congress pass can demonstrate to the world that we have start to put our own house in order if we can show that this nation be able and willing to help other nation meet the common challenge it can demonstrate that the united states will fulfill its responsibility as a leader among nation

 quite frankly at stake be the future of industrialized democracy which have perceive their destiny in common and sustain it in common for 30 year

 the develop nation be also at a turning point the poor nation see their hope of feed their hungry and develop their society shatter by the economic crisis the long term economic future for the producer of raw material also depend on cooperative solution

 our relation with the communist country be a basic factor of the world environment we must seek to build a long term basis for coexistence we will stand by our principle we will stand by our interest we will act firmly when challenge the kind of a world we want depend on a broad policy of create mutual incentive for restraint and for cooperation

 as we move forward to meet our global challenge and opportunity we must have the tool to do the job

 our military force be strong and ready this military strength deter aggression against our ally stabilize our relation with former adversary and protect our homeland fully adequate conventional and strategic force cost many many billion but these dollar be sound insurance for our safety and for a more peaceful world

 military strength alone be not sufficient effective diplomacy be also essential in prevent conflict in build world understanding the vladivostok negotiation with the soviet union represent a major step in moderate strategic arm competition my recent discussion with the leader of the atlantic community japan and south korea have contribute to meet the common challenge

 but we have serious problem before we that require cooperation between the president and the congress by the constitution and tradition the execution of foreign policy be the responsibility of the president

 in recent year under the stress of the vietnam war legislative restriction on the president 's ability to execute foreign policy and military decision have proliferate as a member of the congress i oppose some and i approve other as president i welcome the advice and cooperation of the house and the senate

 but if our foreign policy be to be successful we can not rigidly restrict in legislation the ability of the president to act the conduct of negotiation be ill suited to such limitation legislative restriction intend for the good motive and purpose can have the opposite result as we have see most recently in our trade relation with the soviet union

 for my part i pledge this administration will act in the close consultation with the congress as we face delicate situation and troubled time throughout the globe

 when i become president only five month ago i promise the last congress a policy of communication conciliation compromise and cooperation i renew that pledge to the new member of this congress

 let i sum it up america need a new direction which i have seek to chart here today a change of course which will put the unemployed back to work increase real income and production restrain the growth of federal government spending achieve energy independence and advance the cause of world understanding

 we have the ability we have the know how in partnership with the american people we will achieve these objective

 as our 200th anniversary approach we owe it to ourselves and to posterity to rebuild our political and economic strength let we make america once again and for century more to come what it have so long be a stronghold and a beacon light of liberty for the whole world

 thank you



mr. speaker mr. president distinguished guest my very good friend in the congress and fellow americans

 i stand before you tonight after many agonizing hour in very solemn prayer for guidance by the almighty in my report on the state of the union in january i concentrate on two subject which be uppermost in the mind of the american people urgent action for the recovery of our economy and a comprehensive program to make the united states independent of foreign source of energy

 i thank the congress for the action that it have take thus far in my response for economic recommendation i look forward to early approval of a national energy program to meet our country 's long range and emergency need in the field of energy

 tonight it be my purpose to review our relation with the rest of the world in the spirit of candor and consultation which i have seek to maintain with my former colleague and with our countryman from the time that i take office it be the first priority of my presidency to sustain and strengthen the mutual trust and respect which must exist among americans and their government if we be to deal successfully with the challenge confront we both at home and abroad

 the leadership of the united states of america since the end of world war ii have sustain and advance the security well being and freedom of million of human being besides ourselves despite some setback despite some mistake the united states have make peace a real prospect for we and for all nation i know firsthand that the congress have be a partner in the development and in the support of american foreign policy which five president before i have carry forward with change of course but not of destination

 the course which our country choose in the world today have never be of great significance for ourselves as a nation and for all mankind we build from a solid foundation our alliance with great industrial democracy in europe north america and japan remain strong with a great degree of consultation and equity than ever before

 with the soviet union we have move across a broad front toward a more stable if still competitive relationship we have begin to control the spiral of strategic nuclear armament after two decade of mutual estrangement we have achieve an historic opening with the people 's republic of china

 in the good american tradition we have commit often with strike success our influence and good office to help contain conflict and settle dispute in many many region of the world we have for example help the party of the middle east take the first step toward live with one another in peace

 we have open a new dialog with latin america look toward a healthy hemispheric partnership we be develop close relation with the nation of africa we have exercise international leadership on the great new issue of our interdependent world such as energy food environment and the law of the sea

 the american people can be proud of what their nation have achieve and help other to accomplish but we have from time to time suffer setback and disappointment in foreign policy some be event over which we have no control some be difficulty we impose upon ourselves

 we live in a time of testing and of a time of change our world a world of economic uncertainty political unrest and threat to the peace do not allow we the luxury of abdication or domestic discord

 i recall quite vividly the word of president truman to the congress when the united states face a far great challenge at the end of the second world war if i might quote if we falter in our leadership we may endanger the peace of the world and we shall surely endanger the welfare of this nation

 president truman 's resolution must guide we today our purpose be not to point the finger of blame but to build upon our many success to repair damage where we find it to recover our balance to move ahead as a united people tonight be a time for straight talk among friend about where we stand and where we be go

 a vast human tragedy have befall our friend in vietnam and cambodia tonight i shall not talk only of obligation arise from legal document who can forget the enormous sacrifice of blood dedication and treasure that we make in vietnam

 under five president and 12 congresses the united states be engage in indochina million of americans serve thousand die and many more be wound imprison or lose over $ 150 billion have be appropriate for that war by the congress of the united states and after year of effort we negotiate under the most difficult circumstance a settlement which make it possible for we to remove our military force and bring home with pride our american prisoner this settlement if its term have be adhere to would have permit our south vietnamese ally with our material and moral support to maintain its security and rebuild after two decade of war

 the chance for an endure peace after the last american fight man leave vietnam in 1973 rest on two publicly state premise first that if necessary the united states would help sustain the term of the paris accord it sign 2 year ago and second that the united states would provide adequate economic and military assistance to south vietnam

 let we refresh our memory for just a moment the universal consensus in the united states at that time late 1972 be that if we could end our own involvement and obtain the release of our prisoner we would provide adequate material support to south vietnam the north vietnamese from the moment they sign the paris accord systematically violate the cease fire and other provision of that agreement flagrantly disregard the ban on the infiltration of troop the north vietnamese illegally introduce over 350,000 man into the south in direct violation of the agreement they send in the most modern equipment in massive amount meanwhile they continue to receive large quantity of supply and arm from their friend

 in the face of this situation the united states tear as it be by the emotion of a decade of war be unable to respond we deprive ourselves by law of the ability to enforce the agreement thus give north vietnam assurance that it could violate that agreement with impunity next we reduce our economic and arm aid to south vietnam finally we signal our increase reluctance to give any support to that nation struggle for its survival

 encourage by these development the north vietnamese in recent month begin send even their reserve division into south vietnam some 20 division virtually their entire army be now in south vietnam

 the government of south vietnam uncertain of further american assistance hastily order a strategic withdrawal to more defensible position this extremely difficult maneuver decide upon without consultation be poorly execute hamper by flood of refugee and thus lead to panic the result be painfully obvious and profoundly move

 in my first public comment on this tragic development i call for a new sense of national unity and purpose i say i would not engage in recrimination or attempt to assess the blame i reiterate that tonight

 in the same spirit i welcome the statement of the distinguished majority leader of the united states senate early this week and i quote it be time for the congress and the president to work together in the area of foreign as well as domestic policy

 so let we start afresh

 i be here to work with the congress in the conduct of foreign affair presidential initiative and ability to act swiftly in emergency be essential to our national interest

 with respect to north vietnam i call upon hanoi and ask the congress to join with i in this call to cease military operation immediately and to honor the term of the paris agreement

 the united states be urgently request the signatory of the paris conference to meet their obligation to use their influence to halt the fighting and to enforce the 1973 accord diplomatic note to this effect have be send to all member of the paris conference include the soviet union and the people 's republic of china

 the situation in south vietnam and cambodia have reach a critical phase require immediate and positive decision by this government the option before we be few and the time be very short

 on the one hand the united states could do nothing more let the government of south vietnam save itself and what be leave of its territory if it can let those south vietnamese civilian who have work with we for a decade or more save their life and their family if they can in short shut our eye and wash our hand of the whole affair if we can

 or on the other hand i could ask the congress for authority to enforce the paris accord with our troop and our tank and our aircraft and our artillery and carry the war to the enemy
 there be two narrow option

 first stick with my january request that congress appropriate $ 300 million for military assistance for south vietnam and seek additional fund for economic and humanitarian purpose

 or increase my request for both emergency military and humanitarian assistance to level which by good estimate might enable the south vietnamese to stem the onrushe aggression to stabilize the military situation permit the chance of a negotiate political settlement between the north and south vietnamese and if the very bad be to happen at least allow the orderly evacuation of americans and endanger south vietnamese to place of safety let i now state my consideration and my conclusion

 i have receive a full report from general weyand whom i send to vietnam to assess the situation he advise that the current military situation be very critical but that south vietnam be continue to defend itself with the resource available however he feel that if there be to be any chance of success for their defense plan south vietnam need urgently an additional $ 722 million in very specific military supply from the united states in my judgment a stabilization of the military situation offer the good opportunity for a political solution

 i must of course as i think each of you would consider the safety of nearly 6,000 americans who remain in south vietnam and ten of thousand of south vietnamese employee of the united states government of news agency of contractor and business for many year whose life with their dependent be in very grave peril there be ten of thousand of other south vietnamese intellectual professor teacher editor and opinion leader who have support the south vietnamese cause and the alliance with the united states to whom we have a profound moral obligation

 i be also mindful of our posture toward the rest of the world and particularly of our future relation with the free nation of asia these nation must not think for a minute that the united states be pull out on they or intend to abandon they to aggression

 i have therefore conclude that the national interest of the united states and the cause of world stability require that we continue to give both military and humanitarian assistance to the south vietnamese

 assistance to south vietnam at this stage must be swift and adequate drift and indecision invite far deep disaster the sum i have request before the major north vietnamese offensive and the sudden south vietnamese retreat be obviously inadequate half hearted action would be bad than none we must act together and act decisively

 i be therefore ask the congress to appropriate without delay $ 722 million for emergency military assistance and an initial sum of $ 250 million for economic and humanitarian aid for south vietnam

 the situation in south vietnam be change very rapidly and the need for emergency food medicine and refugee relief be grow by the hour i will work with the congress in the day ahead to develop humanitarian assistance to meet these very pressing need

 fundamental decency require that we do everything in our power to ease the misery and the pain of the monumental human crisis which have befall the people of vietnam million have flee in the face of the communist onslaught and be now homeless and be now destitute i hereby pledge in the name of the american people that the united states will make a maximum humanitarian effort to help care for and feed these hopeless victim

 and now i ask the congress to clarify immediately its restriction on the use of u.s. military force in southeast asia for the limited purpose of protect american life by ensure their evacuation if this should be necessary and i also ask prompt revision of the law to cover those vietnamese to whom we have a very special obligation and whose life may be endanger should the bad come to pass

 i hope that this authority will never have to be use but if it be need there will be no time for congressional debate because of the gravity of the situation i ask the congress to complete action on all of these measure not later than april 19

 in cambodia the situation be tragic the united states and the cambodian government have each make major effort over a long period and through many channel to end that conflict but because of their military success steady external support and their awareness of american legal restriction the communist side have show no interest in negotiation compromise or a political solution and yet for the past 3 month the beleaguered people of phnom penh have fight on hope against hope that the united states would not desert they but instead provide the arm and ammunition they so badly need

 i have receive a move letter from the new act president of cambodia saukham khoy and let i quote it for you

 dear mr. president he write as the american congress reconvene to reconsider your urgent request for supplemental assistance for the khmer republic i appeal to you to convey to the american legislator our plea not to deny these vital resource to we if a nonmilitary solution be to emerge from this tragic 5 year old conflict

 to find a peaceful end to the conflict we need time i do not know how much time but we all fully realize that the agony of the khmer people can not and must not go on much long however for the immediate future we need the rice to feed the hungry and the ammunition and the weapon to defend ourselves against those who want to impose their will by force of arm a denial by the american people of the mean for we to carry on will leave we no alternative but inevitably abandon our search for a solution which will give our citizen some freedom of choice as to their future for a number of year now the cambodian people have place their trust in america i can not believe that this confidence be misplace and that suddenly america will deny we the mean which might give we a chance to find an acceptable solution to our conflict

 this letter speak for itself in january i request food and ammunition for the brave cambodians and i regret to say that as of this evening it may be soon too late

 member of the congress my fellow americans this moment of tragedy for indochina be a time of trial for we it be a time for national resolve

 it have be say that the united states be over extend that we have too many commitment too far from home that we must reexamine what our truly vital interest be and shape our strategy to conform to they i find no fault with this as a theory but in the real world such a course must be pursue carefully and in close coordination with solid progress toward overall reduction in worldwide tension

 we can not in the meantime abandon our friend while our adversary support and encourage theirs we can not dismantle our defense our diplomacy or our intelligence capability while other increase and strengthen theirs

 let we put an end to self inflict wound let we remember that our national unity be a most priceless asset let we deny our adversary the satisfaction of use vietnam to pit americans against americans at this moment the united states must present to the world a united front

 above all let us keep event in southeast asia in their proper perspective the security and the progress of hundred of million of people everywhere depend importantly on we

 let no potential adversary believe that our difficulty or our debate mean a slackening of our national will we will stand by our friend we will honor our commitment and we will uphold our country 's principle

 the american people know that our strength our authority and our leadership have help prevent a third world war for more than a generation we will not shrink from this duty in the decade ahead

 let i now review with you the basic element of our foreign policy speak candidly about our strength and some of our difficulty

 we must first of all face the fact that what have happen in indochina have disquiet many of our friend especially in asia we must deal with this situation promptly and firmly to this end i have already schedule meeting with the leader of australia new zealand singapore and indonesia and i expect to meet with the leader of other asian country as well

 a key country in this respect be japan the warm welcome i receive in japan last november vividly symbolize for both our people the friendship and the solidarity of this extraordinary partnership i look forward as i be sure all of you do with very special pleasure to welcome the emperor when he visit the united states later this year

 we consider our security treaty with japan the cornerstone of stability in the vast reach of asia and the pacific our relation be crucial to our mutual well being together we be work energetically on the international multilateral agenda in trade energy and food we will continue the process of strengthen our friendship mutual security and prosperity

 also of course of fundamental importance be our mutual security relationship with the republic of korea which i reaffirm on my recent visit

 our relation with europe have never be strong there be no people with whom america 's destiny have be more closely link there be no people whose friendship and cooperation be more need for the future for none of the member of the atlantic community can be secure none can prosper none can advance unless we all do so together more than ever these time demand our close collaboration in order to maintain the secure anchor of our common security in this time of international riptide to work together on the promising negotiation with our potential adversary to pool our energy on the great new economic challenge that face we

 in addition to this traditional agenda there be new problem involve energy raw material and the environment the atlantic nation face many and complex negotiation and decision it be time to take stock to consult on our future to affirm once again our cohesion and our common destiny i therefore expect to join with the other leader of the atlantic alliance at a western summit in the very near future

 before this nato meeting i earnestly ask the congress to weigh the broad consideration and consequence of its past action on the complex greek turkish dispute over cyprus our foreign policy can not be simply a collection of special economic or ethnic or ideological interest there must be a deep concern for the overall design of our international action to achieve this design for peace and to assure that our individual act have some coherence the executive must have some flexibility in the conduct of foreign policy

 united states military assistance to an old and faithful ally turkey have be cut off by action of the congress this have impose an embargo on military purchase by turkey extend even to item already pay for an unprecedented act against a friend these move i know be sincerely intend to influence turkey in the cyprus negotiation i deeply share the concern of many citizen for the immense human suffering on cyprus i sympathize with the new democratic government in greece we be continue our earnest effort to find equitable solution to the problem which exist between greece and turkey but the result of the congressional action have be to block progress towards reconciliation thereby prolong the suffering on cyprus to complicate our ability to promote successful negotiation to increase the danger of a broad conflict

 our longstanding relationship with turkey be not simply a favor to turkey it be a clear and essential mutual interest turkey lie on the rim of the soviet union and at the gate of the middle east it be vital to the security of the eastern mediterranean the southern flank of western europe and the collective security of the western alliance our u.s. military basis in turkey be as critical to our own security as they be to the defense of nato

 i therefore call upon the congress to lift the american arm embargo against our turkish ally by pass the bipartisan mansfield scott bill now before the senate only this will enable we to work with greece and turkey to resolve the difference between our ally i accept and indeed welcome the bill 's requirement for monthly report to the congress on progress toward a cyprus settlement but unless this be do with dispatch force may be set in motion within and between the two nation which could not be reverse

 at the same time in order to strengthen the democratic government of greece and to reaffirm our traditional tie with the people of greece we be actively discuss a program of economic and military assistance with they we will shortly be submit specific request to the congress in this regard

 a vital element of our foreign policy be our relationship with the develop country in africa asia and latin america these country must know that america be a true that america be a concerned friend reliable both in word and deed

 as evidence of this friendship i urge the congress to reconsider one provision of the 1974 trade act which have have an unfortunate and unintended impact on our relation with latin america where we have such a long tie of friendship and cooperation under this legislation all member of opec be exclude from our generalized system of trade preference this unfortunately punish two south american friend ecuador and venezuela as well as other opec nation such as nigeria and indonesia none of which participate in last year 's oil embargo this exclusion have seriously complicate our new dialog with our friend in this hemisphere i therefore endorse the amendment which have be introduce in the congress to provide executive authority to waive those restriction on the trade act that be incompatible with our national interest

 the interest of america as well as our ally be vitally affect by what happen in the middle east so long as the state of tension continue it threaten military crisis the weakening of our alliance the stability of the world economy and confrontation with the nuclear super power these be intolerable risk

 because we be in the unique position of be able to deal with all the party we have at their request be engage for the past year and a half in the peacemaking effort unparalleled in the history of the region our policy have bring remarkable success on the road to peace last year two major disengagement agreement be negotiate and implement with our help for the first time in 30 year a process of negotiation on the basic political issue be begin and be continue

 unfortunately the late effort to reach a further interim agreement between israel and egypt have be suspend the issue divide the party be vital to they and not amenable to easy and to quick solution however the united states will not be discourage

 the momentum toward peace that have be achieve over the last 18 month must and will be maintain the active role of the united states must and will be continue the drift toward war must and will be prevent

 i pledge the united states to a major effort for peace in the middle east an effort which i know have the solid support of the american people and their congress we be now examine how good to proceed we have agree in principle to reconvene the geneva conference we be prepared as well to explore other forum the united states will move ahead on whatever course look most promising either towards an overall settlement or interim agreement should the party themselves desire they we will not accept stagnation or stalemate with all its attendant risk to peace and prosperity and to our relation in and outside of the region

 the national interest and national security require as well that we reduce the danger of war we shall strive to do so by continue to improve our relation with potential adversary

 the united states and the soviet union share an interest in lessen tension and build a more stable relationship during this process we have never have any illusion we know that we be deal with a nation that reflect different principle and be our competitor in many part of the globe through a combination of firmness and flexibility the united states in recent year lay the basis of a more reliable relationship found on mutual interest and mutual restraint but we can not expect the soviet union to show restraint in the face of the united states weakness or irresolution

 as long as i be president america will maintain its strength its alliance and its principle as a prerequisite to a more peaceful planet as long as i be president we will not permit detente to become a license to fish in troubled water detente must be and i trust will be a two way relationship

 central to u.s.-soviet relation today be the critical negotiation to control strategic nuclear weapon we hope to turn the vladivostok agreement into a final agreement this year at the time of general secretary brezhnev 's visit to the united states such an agreement would for the first time put a ceiling on the strategic arm race it would mark a turning point in postwar history and would be a crucial step in lifting from mankind the threat of nuclear war

 our use of trade and economic sanction as weapon to alter the internal conduct of other nation must also be seriously reexamine however well intentione the goal the fact be that some of our recent action in the economic field have be self defeat they be not achieve the objective intend by the congress and they have damage our foreign policy

 the trade act of 1974 prohibit most favor nation treatment credit and investment guarantee and commercial agreement with the soviet union so long as their emigration policy fail to meet our criterion the soviet union have therefore refuse to put into effect the important 1972 trade agreement between our two country

 as a result western europe and japan have step into the breach those country have extend credit to the soviet union exceed $ 8 billion in the last 6 month these be economic opportunity job and business which could have go to americans

 there should be no illusion about the nature of the soviet system but there should be no illusion about how to deal with it our belief in the right of people of the world freely to emigrate have be well demonstrate this legislation however not only harm our relation with the soviet union but seriously complicate the prospect of those seek to emigrate the favorable trend aid by quiet diplomacy by which emigration increase from 400 in 1968 to over 33,000 in 1973 have be seriously set back remedial legislation be urgently need in our national interest

 with the people 's republic of china we be firmly fix on the course set forth in the shanghai communique stability in asia and the world require our constructive relation with one fourth of the human race after two decade of mutual isolation and hostility we have in recent year build a promising foundation deep difference in our philosophy and social system will endure but so should our mutual long term interest and the goal to which our country have jointly subscribe in shanghai i will visit china later this year to reaffirm these interest and to accelerate the improvement in our relation and i be glad to welcome the distinguished speaker and the distinguished minority leader of the house back today from their constructive visit to the people 's republic of china

 let i talk about new challenge the issue i have discuss be the most pressing of the traditional agenda on foreign policy but ahead of we also be a vast new agenda of issue in an interdependent world the united states with its economic power its technology its zest for new horizon be the acknowledge world leader in deal with many of these challenge

 if this be a moment of uncertainty in the world it be even more a moment of rare opportunity

 we be summon to meet one of man 's most basic challenge hunger at the world food conference last november in rome the united states outline a comprehensive program to close the ominous gap between population growth and food production over the long term our technological skill and our enormous productive capacity be crucial to accomplish this task

 the old order in trade finance and raw material be change and american leadership be need in the creation of new institution and practice for worldwide prosperity and progress

 the world 's ocean with their immense resource and strategic importance must become area of cooperation rather than conflict american policy be direct to that end

 technology must be harness to the service of mankind while protect the environment this too be an arena for american leadership

 the interest and the aspiration of the developed and develop nation must be reconcile in a manner that be both realistic and humane this be our goal in this new era

 one of the fine success story in our foreign policy be our cooperative effort with other major energy consume nation in little more than a year together with our partner we have create the international energy agency we have negotiate an emergency sharing arrangement which help to reduce the danger of an embargo we have launch major international conservation effort we have develop a massive program for the development of alternative source of energy

 but the fate of all of these program depend crucially on what we do at home every month that pass bring we close to the day when we will be dependent on import energy for 50 percent of our requirement a new embargo under these condition could have a devastating impact on job industrial expansion and inflation at home our economy can not be leave to the mercy of decision over which we have no control and i call upon the congress to act affirmatively

 in a world where information be power a vital element of our national security lie in our intelligence service they be essential to our nation 's security in peace as in war americans can be grateful for the important but largely unsung contribution and achievement of the intelligence service of this nation

 it be entirely proper that this system be subject to congressional review but a sensationalized public debate over legitimate intelligence activity be a disservice to this nation and a threat to our intelligence system it tie our hand while our potential enemy operate with secrecy with skill and with vast resource any investigation must be conduct with maximum discretion and dispatch to avoid cripple a vital national institution

 let i speak quite frankly to some in this chamber and perhaps to some not in this chamber the central intelligence agency have be of maximum importance to president before i the central intelligence agency have be of maximum importance to i the central intelligence agency and its associated intelligence organization could be of maximum importance to some of you in this audience who might be president at some later date i think it would be catastrophic for the congress or anyone else to destroy the usefulness by dismantle in effect our intelligence system upon which we rest so heavily

 now as congress oversee intelligence activity it must of course organize itself to do so in a responsible way it have be traditional for the executive to consult with the congress through specially protect procedure that safeguard essential secret but recently some of those procedure have alter in a way that make the protection of vital information very very difficult i will say to the leader of the congress the house and the senate that i will work with they to devise procedure which will meet the need of the congress for review of intelligence agency activity and the need of the nation for an effective intelligence service

 underlie any successful foreign policy be the strength and the credibility of our defense posture we be strong and we be ready and we intend to remain so improvement of relation with adversary do not mean any relaxation of our national vigilance on the contrary it be the firm maintenance of both strength and vigilance that make possible steady progress toward a safe and a more peaceful world

 the national security budget that i have submit be the minimum the united states need in this critical hour the congress should review it carefully and i know it will but it be my consider judgment that any significant reduction revision would endanger our national security and thus jeopardize the peace

 let no ally doubt our determination to maintain a defense second to none and let no adversary be tempt to test our readiness or our resolve

 history be test we today we can not afford indecision disunity or disarray in the conduct of our foreign affair you and i can resolve here and now that this nation shall move ahead with wisdom with assurance and with national unity

 the world look to we for the vigor and for the vision that we have demonstrate so often in the past in great moment of our national history and as i look down the road i see a confident america secure in its strength secure in its value and determine to maintain both i see a conciliatory america extend its hand to ally and adversary alike form bond of cooperation to deal with the vast problem face we all i see a compassionate america its heart reach out to orphan to refugee and to our fellow human being afflict by war by tyranny and by hunger

 as president entrust by the constitution with primary responsibility for the conduct of our foreign affair i renew the pledge i make last august to work cooperatively with the congress i ask that the congress help to keep america 's word good throughout the world we be one nation one government and we must have one foreign policy

 in an hour far dark than this abraham lincoln tell his fellow citizen and i quote we can not escape history we of this congress and this administration will be remember in spite of ourselves no personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of we

 we who be entrust by the people with the great decision that fashion their future can escape neither responsibility nor our conscience by what we do now the world will know our courage our constancy and our compassion

 the spirit of america be good and the heart of america be strong let we be proud of what we have do and confident of what we can do and may god ever guide we to do what be right

 thank you

mr. president president hurley senator johnston my good friend from the house of representatives eddie hebert dave treen lindy boggs lieutenant governor fitzmorris student faculty alumnus and guest of tulane university
 it be really a great privilege and a very high honor to have an opportunity of participate again in a student activity at tulane university and for this opportunity i thank you very very much
 each time that i have be privileged to visit tulane i have come away newly impressed with the intense application of the student body to the great issue of our time and i be pleased tonight to observe that your interest have not change one bit
 as we come into the building tonight i pass a student who look up from his book and say a journey of a thousand mile begin but with a single step to indicate my interest in he i ask be you try to figure out how to get your goal in life he say no i be try to figure out how to get to the super dome in september laughter well i do not think there be any doubt in my mind that all of you will get to the super dome of course i hope it be to see the green wave tulane university have their very good season on the gridiron i have sort of a feeling that you would not mind make this another year in which you put the tigers louisiana state university in your tank
 when i have the privilege of speak here in 1968 at your direction 68 forum i have no idea that my own career and our entire nation would move so soon in another direction and i say again i be extremely proud to be invite back
 i be impressed as i undoubtedly say before but i would reiterate it tonight by tulane 's unique distinction as the only american university to be convert from state sponsorship to private status and i be also impress by the tulane graduate who serve in the united states congress bennett johnston lindy boggs dave treen
 eddie hebert when i ask he the question whether he be or not and he say he get a special degree dropout 28 laughter
 but i think the fact that you have these three outstanding graduate testify to the academic excellence and the inspiration of this historic university root in the past with its eye on the future
 just as tulane have make a great transition from the past to the future so have new orleans the legendary city that have make such a unique contribution to our great america new orleans be more as i see it than weather brick and cast iron balcony it be a state of mind a melting pot that represent the very very good of america 's evolution an example of retention of a very special culture in a progressive environment of modern change
 on january 8 1815 a monumental american victory be achieve here the battle of new orleans louisiana have be a state for less than three year but outnumber americans innovate outnumber americans use the tactic of the frontier to defeat a veteran british force train in the strategy of the napoleonic war
 we as a nation have suffer humiliation and a measure of defeat in the war of 1812 our national capital in washington have be capture and burn so the illustrious victory in the battle of new orleans be a powerful restorative to our national pride
 yet the victory at new orleans actually take place two week after the signing of the armistice in europe thousand die although a peace have be negotiate the combatant have not get the word yet the epic struggle nevertheless restore america 's pride
 today america can regain the sense of pride that exist before vietnam but it can not be achieve by refighte a war that be finish as far as america be concern as i see it the time have come to look forward to an agenda for the future to unify to bind up the nation 's wound and to restore its health and its optimistic self confidence
 in new orleans a great battle be fight after a war be over in new orleans tonight we can begin a great national reconciliation the first engagement must be with the problem of today but just as importantly the problem of the future that be why i think it be so appropriate that i find myself tonight at a university which address itself to prepare young people for the challenge of tomorrow
 i ask that we stop refighte the battle and the recrimination of the past i ask that we look now at what be right with america at our possibility and our potentiality for change and growth and achievement and sharing i ask that we accept the responsibility of leadership as a good neighbor to all people and the enemy of none i ask that we strive to become in the fine american tradition something more tomorrow than we be today
 instead of my address the image of america i prefer to consider the reality of america it be true that we have launch our bicentennial celebration without having achieve human perfection but we have attain a very remarkable self govern society that possess the flexibility and the dynamism to grow and undertake an entirely new agenda an agenda for america 's third century
 so i ask you to join i in help to write that agenda i be as determined as a president can be to seek national rediscovery of the belief in ourselves that characterize the most creative period in our nation 's history the great challenge of creativity as i see it lie ahead
 we of course be sadden indeed by the event in indochina but these event tragic as they be portend neither the end of the world nor of america 's leadership in the world
 let i put it this way if i might some tend to feel that if we do not succeed in everything everywhere then we have succeed in nothing anywhere i reject categorically such polarize thinking we can and we should help other to help themselves but the fate of responsible man and woman everywhere in the final decision rest in their own hand not in our
 america 's future depend upon americans especially your generation which be now equip itself to assume the challenge of the future to help write the agenda for america
 early today in this great community i speak about the need to maintain our defense tonight i would like to talk about another kind of strength the true source of american power that transcend all of the deterrent power for peace of our armed forces i be speak here of our belief in ourselves and our belief in our nation
 abraham lincoln ask in his own word and i quote what constitute the bulwark of our own liberty and independence and he answer it be not our frown battlement or bristling seacoast our army or our navy our defense be in the spirit which prize liberty as the heritage of all man in all land everywhere
 it be in this spirit that we must now move beyond the discord of the past decade it be in this spirit that i ask you to join i in write an agenda for the future
 i welcome your invitation particularly tonight because i know it be at tulane and other center of thought throughout our great country that much consideration be be give to the kind of future americans want and just as importantly will work for each of you be prepare yourself for the future and i be deeply interested in your preparation and your opinion and your goal however tonight with your indulgence let i share with you my own view
 i envision a creative program that go as far as our courage and our capacity can take we both at home and abroad my goal be for a cooperative world at peace use its resource to build not to destroy
 as president i be determined to offer leadership to overcome our current economic problem my goal be for job for all who want to work and economic opportunity for all who want to achieve
 i be determined to seek self sufficiency in energy as an urgent national priority my goal be to make america independent of foreign energy source by 1985
 of course i will pursue interdependence with other nation and a reform international economic system my goal be for a world in which consume and produce nation achieve a work balance
 i will address the humanitarian issue of hunger and famine of health and of healing my goal be to achieve or to assure basic need and an effective system to achieve this result
 i recognize the need for technology that enrich life while preserve our natural environment my goal be to stimulate productivity but use technology to redeem not to destroy our environment
 i will strive for new cooperation rather than conflict in the peaceful exploration of our ocean and our space my goal be to use resource for peaceful progress rather than war and destruction
 let america symbolize humanity 's struggle to conquer nature and master technology the time have now come for our government to facilitate the individual 's control over his or her future and of the future of america
 but the future require more than americans congratulate themselves on how much we know and how many product that we can produce it require new knowledge to meet new problem we must not only be motivate to build a well america we must know how to do it
 if we really want a humane america that will for instance contribute to the alleviation of the world 's hunger we must realize that good intention do not feed people some problem as anyone who serve in the congress know be complex there be no easy answer willpower alone do not grow food
 we think in a well intentione past that we could export our technology lock stock and barrel to develop nation we do it with the good of intention but we be now learn that a strain of rice that grow in one place will not grow in another that factory that produce at 100 percent in one nation produce less than half as much in a society where temperament and work habit be somewhat different
 yet the world economy have become interdependent not only food technology but money management natural resource and energy research and development all kind of this group require an organized world society that make the maximum effective use of the world 's resource
 i want to tell the world let us grow food together but let us also learn more about nutrition about weather forecasting about irrigation about the many other specialty involve in help people to help themselves
 we must learn more about people about the development of community architecture engineering education motivation productivity public health and medicine art and science political legal and social organization all of these speciality and many many more be require if young people like you be to help this nation develop an agenda for our future your future our country 's future
 i challenge for example the medical student in this audience to put on their agenda the achievement of a cure for cancer i challenge the engineer in this audience to devise new technique for develop cheap clean and plentiful energy and as a byproduct to control flood i challenge the law student in this audience to find way to speed the administration of equal justice and make good citizen out of convict criminal i challenge education those of you as education major to do real teaching for real life i challenge the art major in this audience to compose the great american symphony to write the great american novel and to enrich and inspire our daily life
 america 's leadership be essential america 's resource be vast america 's opportunity be unprecedented
 as we strive together to prefect a new agenda i put high on the list of important point the maintenance of alliance and partnership with other people and other nation these do provide a basis of share value even as we stand up with determination for what we believe this of course require a continue commitment to peace and a determination to use our good office wherever possible to promote well relation between nation of this world
 the new agenda that which be develop by you and by we must place a high priority on the need to stop the spread of nuclear weapon and to work for the mutual reduction in strategic arm and control of other weapon and i must say parenthetically the successful negotiation at vladivostok in my opinion be just a beginning
 your generation of americans be uniquely endow by history to give new meaning to the pride and spirit of america the magnetism of an american society confident of its own strength will attract the good will and the esteem of all people wherever they might be in this globe in which we live it will enhance our own perception of ourselves and our pride in be an american we can we can and i say it with emphasis write a new agenda for our future
 i be glad that tulane university and other great american educational institution be reach out to other in program to work with develop nation and i look forward with confidence to your participation in every aspect of america 's future
 and i urge americans of all age to unite in this bicentennial year to take responsibility for themselves as our ancestor do let we resolve tonight to rediscover the old virtue of confidence and stir reliance and capability that characterize our forefather two century ago i pledge as i know you do each one of we to do our part
 let the beacon light of the past shine forth from historic new orleans and from tulane university and from every other corner of this land to illuminate a boundless future for all americans and a peace for all mankind
 thank you very much

good evening
 last january 15 i go before your senators and representatives in congress with a comprehensive plan to make our country independent of foreign source of energy by 1985 such a program be long overdue we have become increasingly at the mercy of other for the fuel on which our entire economy run
 here be the fact and figure that will not go away the united states be dependent on foreign source for about 37 percent of its present petroleum need in ten year if we do nothing we will be import more than half our oil at price fix by other if they choose to sell to we at all in two and a half year we will be twice as vulnerable to a foreign oil embargo as we be two winter ago
 we be now pay out $ 25 billion a year for foreign oil five year ago we pay out only $ 3 billion annually five year from now if we do nothing who know how many more billion will be flow out of the united states these be not just american dollar these be american job
 four month ago i send the congress this 167 page draft of detailed legislation plus some additional tax proposal my program be design to conserve the energy we now have while at the same time speed up the development and production of new domestic energy although this would increase the cost of energy until new supply be fully tap those dollar would remain in this country and would be return to our own economy through tax cut and rebate
 i ask the congress in january to enact this urgent 10 year program for energy independence within 90 day that be by mid april
 in the meantime to get thing go i say i would use the standby presidential authority grant by the congress to reduce our use of foreign petroleum by raise import fee on each barrel of crude oil by $ 1 on february 1 another dollar on march 1 and a third on april 1
 as soon as congress act on my comprehensive energy program i promise to take off these import fee i impose the first dollar on oil import february 1 make appropriate exemption for hardship situation
 now what do the congress do in february about energy congress do nothing nothing that is except rush through legislation suspend for 90 day my authority to impose any import fee on foreign oil congress need time they say
 at the end of february the democratic leader of the house and senate and other members concern with energy come to the white house they give i this pamphlet outline energy goal similar to mine and promise to come up with a congressional energy program well than mine by the end of april i remember one of they say he do not see how they could ask the president to do more than postpone the second dollar for 60 day if the congress could not come up with an energy program by then he say go ahead and put it on
 their request stretch my original deadline by a couple of week but i want to be reasonable i want to be cooperative so in veto their bill to restrict the president 's authority i agree to their request for a 60 day delay before take the next step under my energy plan
 what do the congress do in march what do the congress do in april about energy congress do nothing
 in fairness i must say there be diligent effort by some member democrats as well as republicans to fashion meaningful energy legislation in their subcommittee and committee my administration work very hard with they to bring a real energy independence bill to a vote at the end of april the deadline set by the congressional leader themselves i defer for still another 30 day the second $ 1 fee on import oil even then i still hope for positive congressional action
 so what have the congress do in may about energy congress do nothing and go home for a 10 day recess
 february march april may as of now the congress have do nothing positive to end our energy dependence
 on the contrary it have take two negative action the first an attempt to prevent the president from do anything on his own the second to pass a strip mining bill which would reduce domestic coal production instead of increase it put thousand of people out of work needlessly increase the cost of energy to consumer raise electric bill for many and compel we to import more foreign oil not less
 i be force to veto this anti energy bill last week because i will not be responsible for take one step backward on energy when the congress will not take one step forward on energy
 the congress have concentrate its attention on conservation measure such as a high gasoline tax the congress have do little or nothing to stimulate production of new energy source here at home at elk hills naval petroleum reserve in california i see oil well wait to produce 300,000 barrel a day if the congress would change the law to permit it
 there be untold million of barrel more in our alaskan petroleum reserve and under the continental shelf we could save 300,000 barrel a day if only the congress would allow more electric powerplant to substitute american coal for foreign oil peaceful atomic power which we pioneer be advance fast abroad than at home
 still the congress do nothing about energy we be today bad off than we be in january domestic oil production be go down down down natural gas production be start to dwindle and many area face severe shortage next winter coal production be still at the level of the 1940 's foreign oil supplier be consider another price increase i could go on and on but you know the fact this country need to regain its independence from foreign source of energy and the soon the well
 there be no visible energy shortage now but we could have one overnight we do not have an energy crisis but we may have one next winter we do have an energy problem a very grave problem but one we can still manage and solve if we be successful internationally and can act decisively domestically
 four month be already lose the congress have act only negatively i must now do what i can do as president
 first i will impose an additional $ 1 import fee on foreign crude oil and 60 cent on refined product effective june 1 i give the congress its 60 day plus an extra 30 day to do something but nothing have be do since january high fee will far discourage the consumption of import fuel and may generate some constructive action when the congress come back
 second as i direct on april 30 the federal energy administration have complete public hearing on decontrol of old domestic oil i will submit a decontrol plan to congress shortly after it reconvene along with it i will urge the congress to pass a windfall profit tax with a plowback provision
 these two measure would prevent unfair gain by oil company from decontrol price furnish a substantial incentive to increase domestic energy production and encourage conservation
 when i talk about energy i be talk about job our american economy run on energy no energy no job in the long run it be just that simple
 the sudden fourfold increase in foreign oil price and the 1973 embargo help to throw we into this recession we be on our way out of this recession another oil embargo could throw we back we can not continue to depend on the price and supply whim of other the congress can not drift dawdle and debate forever with america 's future
 i need your help to energize this congress into comprehensive action i will continue to press for my january program which be still the only total energy program there be
 i can not sit here idly while nothing be do we must get on with the job right now
 thank you and good night

mr. chairman my distinguished colleague
 may i begin by express to the governments of finland and switzerland which have be superb host for the several phase of this conference my gratitude and that of my associate for their efficiency and hospitality
 particularly to you president kekkonen i must convey to the people of the republic of finland on behalf of the 214 million people of the united states of america a reaffirmation of the longstanding affection and admiration which all my countryman hold for your brave and beautiful land
 we be bind together by the most powerful of all tie our fervent love for freedom and independence which know no homeland but the human heart it be a sentiment as endure as the granite rock on which this city stand and as move as the music of sibelius
 our visit here though short have bring we a deep appreciation of the pride industry and friendliness which americans always associate with the finnish nation
 the nation assemble here have keep the general peace in europe for 30 year yet there have be too many narrow escape from major conflict there remain to this day the urgent issue of how to construct a just and last peace for all people
 i have not come across the atlantic to say what all of we already know that nation now have the capacity to destroy civilization and therefore all our foreign policy must have as their one supreme objective the prevention of a thermonuclear war nor have i come to dwell upon the hard reality of continue ideological difference political rivalry and military competition that persist among we
 i have come to helsinki as a spokesman for a nation whose vision have always be forward whose people have always demand that the future be bright than the past and whose united will and purpose at this hour be to work diligently to promote peace and progress not only for ourselves but for all mankind
 i be simply here to say to my colleague we owe it to our child to the child of all continent not to miss any opportunity not to malinger for one minute not to spare ourselves or allow other to shirk in the monumental task of build a well and a safe world
 the american people like the people of europe know well that mere assertion of good will pass change in the political mood of government laudable declaration of principle be not enough but if we proceed with care with commitment to real progress there be now an opportunity to turn our people hope into reality
 in recent year nation represent here have seek to ease potential conflict but much more remain to be do before we prematurely congratulate ourselves
 military competition must be control political competition must be restrain crisis must not be manipulate or exploit for unilateral advantage that could lead we again to the brink of war the process of negotiation must be sustain not at a snail 's pace but with demonstrate enthusiasm and visible progress
 nowhere be the challenge and the opportunity great and more evident than in europe that be why this conference bring we all together conflict in europe shake the world twice in this century we have pay dearly for this lesson at other time we have come perilously close to calamity we dare not forget the tragedy and the terror of those time peace be not a piece of paper
 but last peace be at least possible today because we have learn from the experience of the last 30 year that peace be a process require mutual restraint and practical arrangement
 this conference be a part of that process a challenge not a conclusion we face unresolved problem of military security in europe we face they with very real difference in value and in aim but if we deal with they with careful preparation if we focus on concrete issue if we maintain forward movement we have the right to expect real progress
 the era of confrontation that have divide europe since the end of the second world war may now be end there be a new perception and a shared perception of a change for the well away from confrontation and toward new possibility for secure and mutually beneficial cooperation that be what we all have be say here i welcome and i share these hope for the future
 the postwar policy of the united states have be consistently direct toward the rebuilding of europe and the rebirth of europe 's historic identity the nation of the west have work together for peace and progress throughout europe from the very start we have take the initiative by state clear goal and area for negotiation
 we have seek a structure of european relation temper rivalry with restraint power with moderation build upon the traditional bond that link we with old friend and reach out to forge new tie with former and potential adversary
 in recent year there have be some substantial achievement
 we see the four power agreement on berlin of 1971 as the end of a perennial crisis that on at least three occasion bring the world to the brink of doom
 the agreement between the federal republic of germany and the state of eastern europe and the related intra german accord enable central europe and the world to breathe easy
 the start of east west talk on mutual and balanced force reduction demonstrate a determination to deal with military security problem of the continent
 the 1972 treaty between the united states and the soviet union to limit antiballistic missile and the interim agreement limit strategic offensive arm be the first solid breakthrough in what must be a continue long term process of limit strategic nuclear arsenal
 i profoundly hope that this conference will spur further practical and concrete result it afford a welcome opportunity to widen the circle of those country involve in ease tension between east and west
 participation in the work of detente and participation in the benefit of detente must be everybody 's business in europe and elsewhere but detente can succeed only if everybody understand what detente actually be
 first detente be an evolutionary process not a static condition many formidable challenge yet remain
 second the success of detente of the process of detente depend on new behavior pattern that give life to all our solemn declaration the goal we be state today be the yardstick by which our performance will be measure
 the people of all europe and i assure you the people of north america be thoroughly tired of have their hope raise and then shatter by empty word and unfulfilled pledge we have well say what we mean and mean what we say or we will have the anger of our citizen to answer
 while we must not expect miracle we can and we do expect steady progress that come in step step that be relate to each other that link our action with word in various area of our relation
 finally there must be an acceptance of mutual obligation detente as i have often say must be a two way street tension can not be ease by one side alone both side must want detente and work to achieve it both side must benefit from it
 mr. chairman my colleague this extraordinary gathering in helsinki prove that all our people share a concern for europe 's future and for a well and more peaceful world but what else do it prove how shall we assess the result
 our delegation have work long and hard to produce document which restate noble and praiseworthy political principle they spell out guideline for national behavior and international cooperation
 but every signatory should know that if these be to be more than the late chapter in a long and sorry volume of unfulfilled declaration every party must be dedicate to make they come true
 these document which we will sign represent another step how long or short a step only time will tell in the process of detente and reconcilation in europe our people will be watch and measure our progress they will ask how these noble sentiment be be translate into action that bring about a more secure and just order in the daily life of each of our nation and its citizen
 the document produce here represent compromise like all international negotiation but these principle we have agree upon be more than the low common denominator of governmental position
 they affirm the most fundamental human right liberty of thought conscience and faith the exercise of civil and political right the right of minority
 they call for a free flow of information idea and people great scope for the press cultural and educational exchange family reunification the right to travel and to marriage between national of different state and for the protection of the priceless heritage of our diverse culture
 they offer wide area for great cooperation trade industrial production science and technology the environment transportation health space and the ocean
 they reaffirm the basic principle of relation between state nonintervention sovereign equality self determination territorial integrity inviolability of frontier and the possibility of change by peaceful mean

 almost 200 year ago the united states of america be bear as a free and independent nation the descendant of europeans who proclaim their independence in america express in that declaration a decent respect for the opinion of mankind and assert not only that all man be create equal but they be endow with inalienable right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
 the founder of my country do not merely say that all americans should have these right but all man everywhere should have these right and these principle have guide the united states of america throughout its two century of nationhood they have give hope to million in europe and on every continent
 i have be ask why i be here today
 i be here because i believe and my countryman believe in the interdependence of europe and north america indeed in the interdependence of the entire family of man
 i be here because the leader of 34 other government be here the state of europe and of our good neighbor canada with whom we share an open border of 5,526 mile along which there stand not a single armed soldier and across which our two people have move in friendship and mutual respect for 160 year
 i can say without fear of contradiction that there be not a single people represent here whose blood do not flow in the vein of americans and whose culture and tradition have not enrich the heritage which we americans prize so highly
 when two century ago the united states of america issue a declaration of high principle the cynic and doubter of that day jeered and scoff yet 11 long year later our independence be win and the stability of our republic be really achieve through the incorporation of the same principle in our constitution
 but those principle though they be still be perfect remain the guide light of an american policy and the american people be still dedicate as they be then to a decent respect for the opinion of mankind and to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all people everywhere

 in build a political relationship between east and west we face many challenge
 berlin have a special significance it have be a flashpoint of confrontation in the past it can provide an example of peaceful settlement in the future the united states regard it as a test of detente and of the principle of this conference we welcome the fact that subject to four power right and responsibility the result of csce apply to berlin as they do throughout europe
 military stability in europe have keep the peace while maintain that stability it be now time to reduce substantially the high level of military force on both side negotiation now underway in vienna on mutual and balanced force reduction so far have not produce the result for which i have hope the united states stand ready to demonstrate flexibility in move these negotiation forward if other will do the same an agreement that enhance mutual security be feasible and essential
 the united states also intend to pursue vigorously a further agreement on strategic arm limitation with the soviet union this remain a priority of american policy general secretary brezhnev and i agree last november in vladivostok on the essential of a new accord limit strategic offensive weapon for the next 10 year we be move forward in our bilateral discussion here in helsinki
 the world face an unprecedented danger in the spread of nuclear weapon technology the nation of europe share a great responsibility for an international solution to this problem the benefit of peaceful nuclear energy be become more and more important we must find way to spread these benefit while safeguard the world against the menace of weapon proliferation

 to those nation not participate and to all the people of the world the solemn obligation undertake in these document to promote fundamental right economic and social progress and well being apply ultimately to all people
 can we truly speak of peace and security without address the spread of nuclear weapon in the world or the creation of more sophisticated form of warfare
 can peace be divisible between area of tranquillity and region of conflict can europe truly flourish if we do not all address ourselves to the evil of hunger in country less fortunate than we to the new dimension of economic and energy issue that underline our own progress to the dialog between producer and consumer between exporter and importer between industrial country and less developed one
 and can there be stability and progress in the absence of justice and fundamental freedom
 our people want a well future their expectation have be raise by the very real step that have already be take in arm control political negotiation and expansion of contact and economic relation our presence here offer they further hope we must not let they down
 if the soviet union and the united states can reach agreement so that our astronaut can fit together the most intricate scientific equipment work together and shake hand 137 mile out in space we as statesman have an obligation to do as well on earth
 history will judge this conference not by what we say here today but by what we do tomorrow not by the promise we make but by the promise we keep

 this morning i reflect on the past at the shrine of americans who die on sunday morning 34 year ago i come away with a new spirit of dedication to the ideal that emerge from pearl harbor in world war ii dedication to america 's bipartisan policy of pursue peace through strength and dedication to a new future of interdependence and cooperation with all people of the pacific

 i subscribe to a pacific doctrine of peace with all and hostility toward none the way i would like to remember or recollect pearl harbor be by preserve the power of the past to build the future let we join with new and old country of that great pacific area in create the great civilization on the shore of the great of our ocean

 my visit here to the east west center hold another kind of meaning your center be a catalyst of america 's positive concern for asia its people and its rich diversity of culture you advance our hope that asia will gain a well understanding of the united states

 last year we be pleased to receive and to welcome nearly 54,000 asian student to the united states while thousand upon thousand of american student go to asian country i applaud your contribution to partnership in education your effort represent america 's vision of an open world of understanding freedom and peace

 in hawaii the crossroad of the pacific our past and our future join

 i be deeply move when i visit japan last year and when i recently have the honor of welcome the emperor and the empress of japan to america the gracious welcome that i receive and the warmth of the welcome the american people bestow upon the emperor and the empress testify to a grow friendship and partnership between our two great country this be a tribute to what be good in man his capacity to grow from fear to trust and from a tragedy of the past to a hopeful future it be a superb example of what can be achieve in human progress it inspire our new effort in asia to improve relation

 america a nation of the pacific basin have a very vital stake in asia and a responsibility to take a leading part in lessen tension prevent hostility and preserve peace world stability and our own security depend upon our asian commitment

 in 1941 34 year ago today we be militarily unprepared our trade in the pacific be very limited we exercise jurisdiction over the philippines we be preoccupy with western europe our instinct be isolationist

 we have transcend that age we be now the world 's strong nation our great commercial involvement in asia be expand we lead the way in confer independence upon the philippines now we be work out new association and arrangement with the trust territory of the pacific

 the center of political power in the united states have shift westward our pacific interest and concern have increase we have exchange the freedom of action of an isolationist state for the responsibility of a great global power as i return from this trip to three major asian country i be even more aware of our interest in this part of the world

 the security concern of great world power intersect in asia the united states the soviet union china and japan be all pacific power western europe have historic and economic tie with asia equilibrium in the pacific be absolutely essential to the united states and to the other country in the pacific

 the first premise of a new pacific doctrine be that american strength be basic to any stable balance of power in the pacific we must reach beyond our concern for security but without security there can be neither peace nor progress the preservation of the sovereignty and the independence of our asian friend and ally remain a paramount objective of american policy

 we recognize that force alone be insufficient to assure security popular legitimacy and social justice be vital prerequisite of resistance against subversion or aggression nevertheless we owe it to ourselves and to those whose independence depend upon our continued support to preserve a flexible and balanced position of strength throughout the pacific

 the second basic premise of a new pacific doctrine be that partnership with japan be a pillar of our strategy there be no relationship to which i have devote more attention nor be there any great success story in the history of american effort to relate to distant culture and to people the japanese american relationship can be a source of great great pride to every american and to every japanese our bilateral relation have never be well the recent exchange of visit symbolize a basic political partnership we have begin to develop with the japanese and other advanced industrial democracy well mean of harmonize our economic policy we be join with japan our european friend and representative of the develop nation this month to begin shape a more efficient and more equitable pattern of north south economic relation

 the third premise of a new pacific doctrine be the normalization of relation with the people 's republic of china the strengthening of our new tie with this great nation represent nearly one quarter of mankind this be another recent achievement of american foreign policy it transcend 25 year of hostility

 i visit china to build on the dialog start nearly 4 year ago my wide range exchange with the leader of the people 's republic of china with chairman mao tse tung and vice premier teng hsiao ping enhance our understanding of each other 's view and each other 's policy

 there be as expect difference of perspective our society our philosophy our vary position in the world give we differ perception of our respective national interest but we do find a common ground we reaffirm that we share very important area of concern and agreement they say and we say that the country of asia should be free to develop in a world where there be mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all state where people be free from the threat of foreign aggression where there be noninterference in the internal affair of other and where the principle of equality mutual benefit .and coexistence shape the development of peaceful international order we share opposition to any form of hegemony in asia or in any other part of the world

 i reaffirm the determination of the united states to complete the normalization of relation with the people 's republic of china on the basis of the shanghai communique both side regard our discussion as significant useful and constructive our relationship be become a permanent feature of the international political landscape it benefit not only our two people but all people of the region and the entire world

 a fourth principle of our pacific policy be our continue stake in stability and security in southeast asia

 after leave china i visit indonesia and the philippines indonesia be a nation of 140 million people the fifth large population in the world today it be one of our important new friend and a major country in that area of the world the republic of the philippines be one of our old and dear ally our friendship demonstrate america 's longstanding interest in asia

 i spend three day in djakarta and manila i would have like to have have time to visit our friend in thailand singapore and malaysia we share important political and economic concern with these five nation who make up the association of southeast asian nations

 i can assure you that americans will be hear much more about the asean organization all of its member be friend of the united states their total population equal our own while they be develop country they possess many many asset vital people abundant natural resource and well mannered agriculture they have skilled leader and the determination to develop themselves and to solve their own problem each of these country protect its independence by rely on its own national resilience and diplomacy we must continue to assist they i learn during my visit that our friend want we to remain actively engage in the affair of the region we intend to do so

 we retain close and valuable tie with our old friend and ally in the southwest pacific australia on the one hand and new zealand on the other

 a fifth tenet of our new pacific policy be our belief that peace in asia depend upon a resolution of outstanding political conflict

 in korea tension persist we have close tie with the republic of korea and we remain committed to peace and security on the korean peninsula as the presence of our force there attest respond to the heighten tension last spring we reaffirm our support of the republic of korea today the united states be ready to consider constructive way of ease tension on the peninsula but we will continue to resist any move which attempt to exclude the republic of korea from discussion of its own future

 in indochina the healing effect of time be require our policy toward the new regime of the peninsula will be determine by their conduct toward we we be prepared to reciprocate gesture of good will particularly the return of remain of americans kill or miss in action or information about they if they exhibit restraint toward their neighbor and constructive approach to international problem we will look to the future rather than to the past

 the sixth point of our new policy in the pacific be that peace in asia require a structure of economic cooperation reflect the aspiration of all the people in the region

 the asian pacific economy have recently achieve more rapid growth than any other region in the world our trade with east asia now exceed our transaction with the european community america 's job currency and raw material depend upon economic tie with the pacific basin our trade with the region be now increase by more than 30 percent annually reach some $ 46 billion last year our economy be increasingly interdependent as cooperation grow between developed and develop nation

 our relation with the five asean country be mark by grow maturity and by more modest and more realistic expectation on both side we no long approach they as donor to dependent these proud people look to we less for outright aid than for new trading opportunity and more equitable arrangement for the transfer of science and technology

 there be one common theme which be express to i by the leader of every asian country that i visit they all advocate the continuity of steady and responsible american leadership they seek self reliance in their own future and in their own relation with we

 our military assistance to ally and friend be a modest responsibility but its political significance far surpass the small cost involve we serve our high national interest by strengthen their self reliance their relation with we their solidarity with each other and their regional security

 i emphasize to every leader i meet that the united states be a pacific nation i pledge as president i will continue america 's active concern for asia and our presence in the asian pacific region

 asia be enter a new era we can contribute to a new structure of stability found on a balance among the major power strong tie to our ally in the region an easing of tension between adversary the stir reliance and regional solidarity of small nation and expand economic tie and cultural exchange these component of peace be already evident our foreign policy in recent year and in recent day encourage their growth

 if we can remain steadfast historian will look back and view the 1970 's as the beginning of a period of peaceful cooperation and progress a time of grow community for all the nation touch by this great ocean

 here in the pacific crossroad of hawaii we envision hope for a wide community of man we see the promise of a unique republic which include all the world 's race no other country have be so truly a free multiracial society hawaii be a splendid example a splendid showcase of america and exemplify our destiny as a pacific nation

 america 's pacific heritage emerge from this remarkable state i be proud to visit hawaii the island star in the american firmament which radiate the universal magic of aloha

 let there flow from hawaii and from all of the states in our union to all people east and west a new spirit of interchange to build human brotherhood thank you very much

mr. speaker mr. vice president member of the 94th congress and distinguished guest

 as we begin our bicentennial america be still one of the young nation in record history long before our forefather come to these shore man and woman have be struggle on this planet to forge a well life for themselves and their family

 in man 's long upward march from savagery and slavery throughout the nearly 2,000 year of the christian calendar the nearly 6,000 year of jewish reckoning there have be many deep terrifying valley but also many bright and towering peak

 one peak stand high in the range of human history one example shine forth of a people unite to produce abundance and to share the good life fairly and with freedom one union hold out the promise of justice and opportunity for every citizen that union be the united states of america

 we have not remade paradise on earth we know perfection will not be find here but think for a minute how far we have come in 200 year

 we come from many root and we have many branch yet all americans across the eight generation that separate we from the stir deed of 1776 those who know no other homeland and those who just find refuge among our shore say in unison

 i be proud of america and i be proud to be an american life will be a little well here for my child than for i i believe this not because i be tell to believe it but because life have be well for i than it be for my father and my mother i know it will be well for my child because my hand my brain my voice and my vote can help make it happen

 it have happen here in america it have happen to you and to i government exist to create and preserve condition in which people can translate their idea into practical reality in the good of time much be lose in translation but we try sometimes we have try and fail always we have have the good of intention

 but in the recent past we sometimes forget the sound principle that guide we through most of our history we want to accomplish great thing and solve age old problem and we become overconfident of our ability we try to be a policeman abroad and the indulgent parent here at home

 we think we could transform the country through massive national program but often the program do not work too often they only make thing bad in our rush to accomplish great deed quickly we trample on sound principle of restraint and endanger the right of individual we unbalance our economic system by the huge and unprecedented growth of federal expenditure and borrowing and we be not totally honest with ourselves about how much these program would cost and how we would pay for they finally we shift our emphasis from defense to domestic problem while our adversary continue a massive buildup of arm

 the time have now come for a fundamentally different approach for a new realism that be true to the great principle upon which this nation be found

 we must introduce a new balance to our economy a balance that favor not only sound active government but also a much more vigorous healthy economy that can create new job and hold down price

 we must introduce a new balance in the relationship between the individual and the government a balance that favor great individual freedom and self reliance

 we must strike a new balance in our system of federalism a balance that favor great responsibility and freedom for the leader of our state and local government

 we must introduce a new balance between the spending on domestic program and spending on defense a balance that ensure we will fully meet our obligation to the needy while also protect our security in a world that be still hostile to freedom

 and in all that we do we must be more honest with the american people promise they no more than we can deliver and deliver all that we promise

 the genius of america have be its incredible ability to improve the life of its citizen through a unique combination of governmental and free citizen activity

 history and experience tell we that moral progress can not come in comfortable and in complacent time but out of trial and out of confusion tom paine arouse the troubled americans of 1776 to stand up to the time that try man 's soul because the hard the conflict the more glorious the triumph

 just a year ago i report that the state of the union be not good tonight i report that the state of our union be well in many way a lot well but still not good enough

 to paraphrase tom paine 1975 be not a year for summer soldier and sum shine patriot it be a year of fear and alarm and of dire forecast most of which never happen and will not happen

 as you recall the year 1975 open with rancor and with bitterness political misdeed of the past have neither be forget nor forgive the long most divisive war in our history be wind toward an unhappy conclusion many fear that the end of that foreign war of man and machine mean the beginning of a domestic war of recrimination and reprisal friend and adversary abroad be ask whether america have lose its nerve finally our economy be ravage by inflation inflation that be plunge we into the bad recession in four decade at the same time americans become increasingly alienated from big institution they be steadily lose confidence not just in big government but in big business big labor and big education among other ours be a troubled land

 and so 1975 be a year of hard decision difficult compromise and a new realism that teach we something important about america it bring back a needed measure of common sense steadfastness and self discipline

 americans do not panic or demand instant but useless cure in all sector people meet their difficult problem with the restraint and with responsibility worthy of their great heritage

 add up the separate piece of progress in 1975 subtract the setback and the sum total show that we be not only head in a new direction a direction which i propose 12 month ago but it turn out to be the right direction

 it be the right direction because it follow the truly revolutionary american concept of 1776 which hold that in a free society the making of public policy and successful problemsolving involve much more than government it involve a full partnership among all branch and all level of government private institution and individual citizen

 common sense tell i to stick to that steady course

 take the state of our economy last january most thing be rapidly get bad this january most thing be slowly but surely get well

 the bad recession since world war ii turn around in april the good cost of living news of the past year be that double digit inflation of 12 percent or high be cut almost in half the bad unemployment remain far too high

 today nearly 1,700,000 more americans be work than at the bottom of the recession at year 's end people be again be hire much fast than they be be lay off

 yet let us be honest many americans have not yet feel these change in their daily life they still see price go up far too fast and they still know the fear of unemployment

 we be also a grow nation we need more and more job every year today 's economy have produce over 85 million job for americans but we need a lot more job especially for the young

 my first objective be to have sound economic growth without inflation

 we all know from recent experience what runaway inflation do to ruin every other worthy purpose we be slow it we must stop it cold

 for many americans the way to a healthy noninflationary economy have become increasingly apparent the government must stop spend so much and stop borrow so much of our money more money must remain in private hand where it will do the most good to hold down the cost of living we must hold down the cost of government

 in the past decade the federal budget have be grow at an average rate of over 10 percent a year the budget i be submit wednesday cut this rate of growth in half i have keep my promise to submit a budget for the next fiscal year of $ 395 billion in fact it be $ 394.2 billion

 by hold down the growth of federal spending we can afford additional tax cut and return to the people who pay taxis more decisionmake power over their own life

 last month i sign legislation to extend the 1975 tax reduction for the first six month of this year i now propose that effective july 1 1976 we give our taxpayer a tax cut of approximately $ 10 billion more than congress agree to in december

 my broad tax reduction would mean that for a family of four make $ 15,000 a year there will be $ 227 more in take home pay annually hardworke americans catch in the middle can really use that kind of extra cash

 my recommendation for a firm restraint on the growth of federal spending and for great tax reduction be simple and straightforward for every dollar save in cut the growth in the federal budget we can have an add dollar of federal tax reduction

 we can achieve a balanced budget by 1979 if we have the courage and the wisdom to continue to reduce the growth of federal spending

 one test of a healthy economy be a job for every american who want to work government our kind of government cannot create that many job but the federal government can create condition and incentive for private business and industry to make more and more job

 five out of six job in this country be in private business and in industry common sense tell we this be the place to look for more job and to find they fast i mean real rewarding permanent job

 to achieve this we must offer the american people great incentive to invest in the future my tax proposal be a major step in that direction to supplement these proposal i ask that congress enact change in federal tax law that will speed up plant expansion and the purchase of new equipment my recommendation will concentrate this job creation tax incentive in area where the unemployment rate now run over 7 percent legislation to get this start must be approve at the early possible date

 within the strict budget total that i will recommend for the come year i will ask for additional housing assistance for 500,000 family these program will expand housing opportunity spur construction and help to house moderate- and low income family

 we have a disappointing year in the housing industry in 1975 but with low interest rate and available mortgage money we can have a healthy recovery in 1976

 a necessary condition of a healthy economy be freedom from the petty tyranny of massive government regulation we be waste literally million of work hour cost billion of taxpayer and consumer dollar because of bureaucratic redtape the american farmer who now feed 215 million americans but also million worldwide have show how touch more he can produce without the shackle of government control

 now we badly need reform in other key area in our economy the airline trucking railroad and financial institution i have submit concrete plan in each of these area not to help this or that industry but to foster competition and to bring price down for the consumer

 this administration in addition will strictly enforce the federal antitrust law for the very same purpose

 take a long look at america 's future there can be neither sustained growth nor more job unless we continue to have an assured supply of energy to run our economy domestic production of oil and gas be still decline our dependence on foreign oil at high price be still too great drain job and dollar away from our own economy at the rate of $ 125 per year for every american

 last month i sign a compromise national energy bill which enact a part of my comprehensive energy independence program this legislation be late not the complete answer to energy independence but still a start in the right direction

 i again urge the congress to move ahead immediately on the remainder of my energy proposal to make america invulnerable to the foreign oil cartel

 my proposal as all of you know would reduce domestic natural gas shortage allow production from federal petroleum reserve stimulate effective conservation include revitalization of our railroad and the expansion of our urban transportation system develop more and clean energy from our vast coal resource expedite clean and safe nuclear power production create a new national energy independence authority to stimulate vital energy investment and accelerate development of technology to capture energy from the sun and the earth for this and future generation

 also i ask for the sake of future generation that we preserve the family farm and family own small business both strengthen america and give stability to our economy i will propose estate tax change so that family business and family farm can be hand down from generation to generation without have to be sell to pay taxis

 i propose tax change to encourage people to invest in america 's future and their own through a plan that give moderate income family income tax benefit if they make long term investment in common stock in american company

 the federal government must and will respond to clear cut national need for this and future generation

 hospital and medical service in america be among the good in the world but the cost of a serious and extended illness can quickly wipe out a family 's lifetime saving increase health cost be of deep concern to all and a powerful force push up the cost of living the burden of catastrophic illness can be bear by very few in our society we must eliminate this fear from every family

 i propose catastrophic health insurance for everybody cover by medicare to finance this add protection fee for short term care will go up somewhat but nobody after reach age 65 will have to pay more than $ 500 a year for covered hospital or nursing home care nor more than $ 250 for one year 's doctor bill

 we can not realistically afford federally dictate national health insurance provide full coverage for all 215 million americans the experience of other country raise question about the quality as well as the cost of such plan but i do envision the day when we may use the private health insurance system to offer more middle income family high quality health service at price they can afford and shield they also from their catastrophic illness

 use resource now available i propose improve the medicare and other federal health program to help those who really need protection old people and the poor to help state and local government give well health care to the poor i propose that we combine 16 exist federal program include medicaid into a single $ 10 billion federal grant

 fund would be divide among state under a new formula which provide a large share of federal money to those state that have a large share of low income family

 i will take further step to improve the quality of medical and hospital care for those who have serve in our armed force

 now let i speak about social security our federal social security system for people who have work and contribute to it for all their life be a vital part of our economic system its value be no long debatable in my budget for fiscal year 1977 i be recommend that the full cost of living increase in the social security benefit be pay during the come year

 but i be concern about the integrity of our social security trust fund that enable people those retire and those still work who will retire to count on this source of retirement income young worker watch their deduction rise and wonder if they will be adequately protect in the future we must meet this challenge head on simple arithmetic warn all of we that the social security trust fund be head for trouble unless we act soon to make sure the fund take in as much as it pay out there will be no security for old or for young

 i must therefore recommend a three tenth of 1 percent increase in both employer and employee social security taxis effective january 1 1977 this will cost each cover employee less than one extra dollar a week and will ensure the integrity of the trust fund

 as we rebuild our economy we have a continue responsibility to provide a temporary cushion to the unemployed at my request the congress enact two extension and two expansion in unemployment insurance which help those who be jobless during 1975 these program will continue in 1976

 in my fiscal year 1977 budget i be also request fund to continue prove job training and employment opportunity program for million of other americans

 compassion and a sense of community two of america 's great strength throughout our history tell we we must take care of our neighbor who can not take care of themselves the host of federal program in this field reflect our generosity as a people

 but everyone realize that when it come to welfare government at all level be not do the job well too many of our welfare program be inequitable and invite abuse too many of our welfare program have problem from begin to end bad we be waste badly need resource without reach many of the truly needy

 complex welfare program can not be reform overnight surely we can not simply dump welfare into the lap of the 50 state their local taxpayer or their private charity and just walk away from it nor be it the right time for massive and sweeping change while we be still recover from the recession

 nevertheless there be still plenty of improvement that we can make i will ask congress for presidential authority to tighten up the rule for eligibility and benefit

 last year i twice seek long overdue reform of the scandal riddle food stamp program this year i say again let us give food stamp to those most in need let us not give any to those who do not need they

 protect the life and property of the citizen at home be the responsibility of all public official but be primarily the job of local and state law enforcement authority

 americans have always find the very thought of a federal police force repugnant and so do i. but there be proper way in which we can help to insure domestic tranquility as the constitution charge we

 my recommendation on how to control violent crime be submit to the congress last june with strong emphasis on protect the innocent victim of crime to keep a convict criminal from commit more crime we must put he in prison so he can not harm more law abide citizen to be effective this punishment must be swift and it must be certain

 too often criminal be not send to prison after conviction but be allow to return to the street some judge be reluctant to send convict criminal to prison because of inadequate facility to alleviate this problem at the federal level my new budget propose the construction of four new federal facility

 to speed federal justice i propose an increase this year in the united states attorney prosecute federal crime and the reinforcement of the number of united states marshal additional federal judge be need as recommend by i and the judicial conference

 another major threat to every american 's person and property be the criminal carry a handgun the way to cut down on the criminal use of gun be not to take gun away from the law abide citizen but to impose mandatory sentence for crime in which a gun be use make it hard to obtain cheap gun for criminal purpose and concentrate gun control enforcement in highcrime area

 my budget recommend 500 additional federal agent in the 11 large metropolitan high crime area to help local authority stop criminal from sell and use handgun

 the sale of hard drug be tragically on the increase again i have direct all agency of the federal government to step up law enforcement effort against those who deal in drug in 1975 i be glad to report federal agent seize substantially more heroin come into our country than in 1974

 as president i have talk personally with the leader of mexico colombia and turkey to urge great effort by their government to control effectively the production and shipment of hard drug

 i recommend month ago that the congress enact mandatory fix sentence for person convict of federal crime involve the sale of hard drug hard drug we all know degrade the spirit as they destroy the body of their user

 it be unrealistic and misleading to hold out the hope that the federal government can move into every neighborhood and clean up crime under the constitution the great responsibility for curb crime lie with state and local authority they be the frontline fighter in the war against crime

 there be definite way in which the federal government can help they i will propose in the new budget that congress authorize almost $ 7 billion over the next five year to assist state and local government to protect the safety and property of all their citizen

 as president i pledge the strict enforcement of federal law and by example support and leadership to help state and local authority enforce their law together we must protect the victim of crime and ensure domestic tranquility

 last year i strongly recommend a five year extension of the exist revenue sharing legislation which thus far have provide $ 23 billion to help state and local unit of government solve problem at home this program have be effective with decisionmake transfer from the federal government to locally elect official congress must act this year or state and local unit of government will have to drop program or raise local taxis

 include my health care program reform i propose to consolidate some 59 separate federal program and provide flexible federal dollar grant to help state city and local agency in such important area as education child nutrition and social service this flexible system will do the job well and do it close to home

 the protection of the life and property of americans from foreign enemy be one of my primary responsibility as president

 in a world of instant communication and intercontinental ballistic missile in a world economy that be global and interdependent our relation with other nation become more not less important to the life of americans

 america have have a unique role in the world since the day of our independence 200 year ago and ever since the end of world war ii we have bear successfully a heavy responsibility for ensure a stable world order and hope for human progress

 today the state of our foreign policy be sound and strong we be at peace and i will do all in my power to keep it that way

 our military force be capable and ready our military power be without equal and i intend to keep it that way

 our principal alliance with the industrial democracy of the atlantic community and japan have never be more solid

 a further agreement to limit the strategic arm race may be achieve

 we have an improve relationship with china the world 's most populous nation

 the key element for peace among the nation of the middle east now exist our traditional friendship in latin america africa and asia continue

 we have take the role of leadership in launch a serious and hopeful dialog between the industrial world and the develop world

 we have help to achieve significant reform of the international monetary system

 we should be proud of what america what our country have accomplish in these area and i believe the american people be

 the american people have hear too much about how terrible our mistake how evil our deed and how misguide our purpose the american people know well

 the truth be we be the world 's great democracy we remain the symbol of man 's aspiration for liberty and well being we be the embodiment of hope for progress

 i say it be time we quit downgrade ourselves as a nation of course it be our responsibility to learn the right lesson from past mistake it be our duty to see that they never happen again but our great duty be to look to the future the world 's trouble will not go away

 the american people want strong and effective international and defense policy in our constitutional system these policy should reflect consultation and accommodation between the president and the congress but in the final analysis as the framer of our constitution know from hard experience the foreign relation of the united states can be conduct effectively only if there be strong central direction that allow flexibility of action that responsibility clearly rest with the president

 i pledge to the american people policy which seek a secure just and peaceful world i pledge to the congress to work with you to that end

 we must not face a future in which we can no long help our friend such as angola even in limited and carefully control way we must not lose all capacity to respond short of military intervention

 some hasty action of the congress during the past year most recently in respect to angola be in my view very shortsighted unfortunately they be still very much on the mind of our ally and our adversary

 a strong defense posture give weight to our value and our view in international negotiation it assure the vigor of our alliance and it sustain our effort to promote settlement of international conflict only from a position of strength can we negotiate a balanced agreement to limit the growth of nuclear arm only a balanced agreement will serve our interest and minimize the threat of nuclear confrontation

 the defense budget i will submit to the congress for fiscal year 1977 will show an essential increase over the current year it provide for real growth in purchase power over this year 's defense budget which include the cost of the all volunteer force

 we be continue to make economy to enhance the efficiency of our military force but the budget i will submit represent the necessity of american strength for the real world in which we live

 as conflict and rivalry persist in the world our united states intelligence capability must be the good in the world

 the crippling of our foreign intelligence service increase the danger of american involvement in direct armed conflict our adversary be encourage to attempt new adventure while our own ability to monitor event and to influence event short of military action be undermine without effective intelligence capability the united states stand blindfold and hobble

 in the near future i will take action to reform and strengthen our intelligence community i ask for your positive cooperation it be time to go beyond sensationalism and ensure an effective responsible and responsive intelligence capability

 tonight i have speak about our problem at home and abroad i have recommend policy that will meet the challenge of our third century i have no doubt that our union will endure well strong and with more individual freedom we can see forward only dimly one year five year a generation perhaps like our forefather we know that if we meet the challenge of our own time with a common sense of purpose and conviction if we remain true to our constitution and to our ideal then we can know that the future will be well than the past

 i see america today cross a threshold not just because it be our bicentennial but because we have be test in adversity we have take a new look at what we want to be and what we want our nation to become

 i see america resurgent certain once again that life will be well for our child than it be for we seek strength that can not be count in megaton and rich that can not be erode by inflation

 i see these united states of america move forward as before toward a more perfect union where the government serve and the people rule

 we will not make this happen simply by make speech good or bad your or mine but by hard work and hard decision make with courage and with common sense

 i have hear many inspire presidential speech but the word i remember well be speak by dwight d. eisenhower america be not good because it be great the president say america be great because it be good

 president eisenhower be raise in a poor but religious home in the heart of america his simple word echo president lincoln 's eloquent testament that right make might and lincoln in turn evoke the silent image of george washington kneeling in prayer at valley forge

 so all these magic memory which link eight generation of americans be sum up in the inscription just above i how many time have we see it in god we trust

 let we engrave it now in each of our heart as we begin our bicentennial



mr. chairman delegate and alternate to this republican convention
 i be honor by your nomination and i accept it with pride with gratitude and with a total will to win a great victory for the american people we will wage a win campaign in every region of this country from the snowy bank of minnesota to the sandy plain of georgia we concede not a single state we concede not a single vote

 i be deeply grateful to those who stand with i in win the nomination of the party whose cause i have serve all of my adult life i respect the conviction of those who want a change in washington i want a change too after 22 long year of majority misrule let us change the united states congress
 my gratitude tonight reach far beyond this arena to countless friend whose confidence hard work and unselfish support have bring i to this moment it would be unfair to single out anyone but may i make an exception for my wonderful family mike jack steve and susan and especially my dear wife betty
 we republicans have have some tough competition we not only preach the virtue of competition we practice they but tonight we come together not on a battlefield to conclude a cease fire but to join force on a training field that have condition we all for the rugged contest ahead let i say this from the bottom of my heart after the scrimmage of the past few month it really feel good to have ron reagan on the same side of the line
 to strengthen our championship lineup the convention have wisely choose one of the able americans as our next vice president senator bob dole of kansas with his help with your help with the help of million of americans who cherish peace who want freedom preserve prosperity share and pride in america we will win this election i speak not of a republican victory but a victory for the american people
 you at home listening tonight you be the people who pay the taxis and obey the law you be the people who make our system work you be the people who make america what it be it be from your rank that i come and on your side that i stand
 something wonderful happen to this country of ours the past two year we all come to realize it on the fourth of july together out of year of turmoil and tragedy war and riot assassination and wrongdoing in high place americans recapture the spirit of 1776 we see again the pioneer vision of our revolutionary founder and our immigrant ancestor their vision be of free man and free woman enjoy limited government and unlimited opportunity the mandate i want in 1976 be to make this vision a reality but it will take the voice and the vote of many more americans who be not republicans to make that mandate bind and my mission possible
 i have be call an unelected president an accidental president we may even hear that again from the other party despite the fact that i be welcome and endorse by an overwhelming majority of their elect representative in the congress who certify my fitness to our high office having become vice president and president without expect or seek either i have a special feeling toward these high office to i the presidency and the vice presidency be not prize to be win but a duty to be do
 so tonight it be not the power and the glamour of the presidency that lead i to ask for another four year it be something every hard work american will understand the challenge of a job well begin but far from finished
 two year ago on august 9 1974 i place my hand on the bible which betty hold and take the same constitutional oath that be administer to george washington i have faith in our people in our institution and in myself my fellow americans i say our long national nightmare be over
 it be an hour in our history that trouble our mind and tear at our heart anger and hatred have rise to dangerous level divide friend and family the polarization of our political order have arouse unworthy passion of reprisal and revenge our governmental system be close to stalemate than at any time since abraham lincoln take the same oath of office our economy be in the throe of runaway inflation take we headlong into the bad recession since franklin d. roosevelt take the same oath
 on that dark day i tell my fellow countryman i be acutely aware that you have not elect i as your president by your ballot so i ask you to confirm i as your president with your prayer
 on a marble fireplace in the white house be carve a prayer which john adams write it conclude may none but honest and wise man ever rule under this roof since i have reside in that historic house i have try to live by that prayer i face many tough problem i probably make some mistake but on balance america and americans have make an incredible comeback since august 1974 nobody can honestly say otherwise and the plain truth be that the great progress we have make at home and abroad be in spite of the majority who run the congress of the united states
 for two year i have stand for all the people against a vote hungry free spend congressional majority on capitol hill fifty five time i veto extravagant and unwise legislation 45 time i make those veto stick those veto have save american taxpayer billion and billion of dollar i be against the big tax spender and for the little taxpayer
 i call for a permanent tax cut couple with spending reduction to stimulate the economy and relieve hard press middle income taxpayer your personal exemption must be raise from $ 750 to $ 1,000 the other party 's platform talk about tax reform but there be one big problem their own congress will not act
 i call for reasonable constitutional restriction on court order busing of schoolchildren but the other party 's platform concede that busing should be a last resort but there be the same problem their own congress will not act
 i call for a major overhaul of criminal law to crack down on crime and illegal drug the other party 's platform deplore america 's $ 90 billion cost of crime there be the problem again their own congress will not act
 the other party 's platform talk about a strong defense now here be the other side of the problem their own congress do act they slash $ 50 billion from our national defense need in the last 10 year
 my friend washington be not the problem their congress be the problem you know the president of the united states be not a magician who can wave a wand or sign a paper that will instantly end a war cure a recession or make bureaucracy disappear a president have immense power under the constitution but all of they ultimately come from the american people and their mandate to he that be why tonight i turn to the american people and ask not only for your prayer but also for your strength and your support for your voice and for your vote
 i come before you with a 2 year record of performance without your mandate i offer you a 4 year pledge of great performance with your mandate as governor al smith use to say let us look at the record
 two year ago inflation be 12 percent sale be off plant be shut down thousand be be lay off every week fear of the future be throttle down our economy and threaten million of family
 let us look at the record since august 1974 inflation have be cut in half payroll be up profit be up production be up purchase be up since the recession be turn around almost 4 million of our fellow americans have find new job or get their old job back this year more man and woman have job than ever before in the history of the united states confidence have return and we be in the full surge of sound recovery to steady prosperity
 two year ago america be mire in withdrawal from southeast asia a decade of congresses have shortchange our global defense and threaten our strategic posture mount tension between israel and the arab nation make another war seem inevitable the whole world watch and wonder where america be go do we in our domestic turmoil have the will the stamina and the unity to stand up for freedom
 look at the record since august two year ago today america be at peace and seek peace for all nation not a single american be at war anywhere on the face of this earth tonight
 our tie with western europe and japan economic as well as military be never strong our relation with eastern europe the soviet union and mainland china be firm vigilant and forward look policy i have initiate offer sound progress for the people of the pacific africa and latin america israel and egypt both trust the united states have take an historic step that promise an eventual just settlement for the whole middle east
 the world now respect america 's policy of peace through strength the united states be again the confident leader of the free world nobody question our dedication to peace but nobody doubt our willingness to use our strength when our vital interest be at stake and we will i call for an up to date powerful army navy air force and marines that will keep america secure for decade a strong military posture be always the good insurance for peace but america 's strength have never rest on arm alone it be root in our mutual commitment of our citizen and leader in the high standard of ethic and morality and in the spiritual renewal which our nation be undergo right now
 two year ago people 's confidence in their high official to whom they have overwhelmingly entrust power have twice be shatter lose faith in the word of their elect leader americans lose some of their own faith in themselves
 again let us look at the record since august 1974 from the start my administration have be open candid forthright while my entire public and private life be under search examination for the vice presidency i reaffirm my lifelong conviction that truth be the glue that hold government together not only government but civilization itself i have demand honesty decency and personal integrity from everybody in the executive branch of the government the house and senate have the same duty
 the american people will not accept a double standard in the united states congress those who make our law today must not debase the reputation of our great legislative body that have give we such giant as daniel webster henry clay sam rayburn and robert a. taft whether in the nation 's capital the state capital or city hall private morality and public trust must go together
 from august of 1974 to august of 1976 the record show steady progress upward toward prosperity peace and public trust my record be one of progress not platitude my record be one of specific not smile my record be one of performance not promise it be a record i be proud to run on it be a record the american people democrats independents and republicans alike will support on november 2
 for the next four year i pledge to you that i will hold to the steady course we have begin but i have no intention of stand on the record alone
 we will continue win the fight against inflation we will go on reduce the dead weight and impudence of bureaucracy we will submit a balanced budget by 1978
 we will improve the quality of life at work at play and in our home and in our neighborhood we will not abandon our city we will encourage urban program which assure safety in the street create healthy environment and restore neighborhood pride we will return control of our child 's education to parent and local school authority

 we will build an america where people feel rich in spirit as well as in worldly good we will build an america where people feel proud about themselves and about their country
 we will build on performance not promise experience not expediency real progress instead of mysterious plan to be reveal in some dim and distant future the american people be wise wise than our opponent think they know who pay for every campaign promise they be not afraid of the truth we will tell they the truth
 from start to finish our campaign will be credible it will be responsible we will come out fight and we will win yes we have all see the poll and the pundit who say our party be dead i have hear that before so do harry truman i will tell you what i think the only poll that count be the poll the american people go to on november 2 and right now i predict that the american people be go to say that night jerry you have do a good job keep right on do it
 as i try in my imagination to look into the home where family be watch the end of this great convention i can not tell which face be republicans which be democrats and which be independent i can not see their color or their creed i see only americans
 i see americans who love their husband their wife and their child i see americans who love their country for what it have be and what it must become i see americans who work hard but who be willing to sacrifice all they have work for to keep their child and their country free i see americans who in their own quiet way pray for peace among nation and peace among themselves we do love our neighbor and we do forgive those who have trespass against we

 god help i i will not let you down
 thank you very much

mr. president mrs. ford mr. vice president mr. vice president to be the distinguished guest here you lady and gentleman i be go to say fellow republicans here but those who be watch from a distance all those million of democrats and independent who i know be look for a cause around which to rally and which i believe we can give they mr. president before you arrive tonight these wonderful people here when we come in give nancy and myself a welcome that plus this plus your kindness and generosity in honor we by bring we down here will give we a memory that will live in our heart forever

 watch on television these last few night i have see also the warmth with which you greet nancy and you also fill my heart with joy when you do that may i say some word there be cynic who say that a party platform be something that no one bother to read and be do not very often amount to much whether it be different this time than be have ever be before i believe the republican party have a platform that be a banner of bold unmistakable color with no pale pastel shade we have just hear a call to arm base on that platform

 and a call to we to really be successful in communicating and reveal to the american people the difference between this platform and the platform of the oppose party which be nothing but a revamp and a reissue and a rerunning of a late late show of the thing that we have be hear from they for the last 40 year

 if i could just take a moment i have an assignment the other day someone ask i to write a letter for a time capsule that be go to open in los angeles a hundred year from now on our tricentennial

 it sound like an easy assignment they suggest i write about the problem and issue of the day and i set out to do so ride down the coast in an automobile look at the blue pacific out on one side and the santa ynez mountains on the other and i could not help but wonder if it be go to be that beautiful a hundred year from now as it be on that summer day

 and then as i try to write let your own mind turn to that task you be go to write for people a hundred year from now who know all about we we know nothing about they we do not know what kind of world they will be live in and suddenly i think to myself if i write of the problem they will be the domestic problem of which the president speak here tonight the challenge confront we the erosion of freedom take place under democratic rule in this country the invasion of private right the control and restriction on the vitality of the great free economy that we enjoy these be the challenge that we must meet and then again there be that challenge of which he speak that we live in a world in which the great power have aim and poise at each other horrible missile of destruction nuclear weapon that can in a matter of minute arrive at each other 's country and destroy virtually the civilized world we live in

 and suddenly it dawn on i those who would read this letter a hundred year from now will know whether those missile be fire they will know whether we meet our challenge

 whether they will have the freedom that we have know up until now will depend on what we do here will they look back with appreciation and say thank god for those people in 1976 who head off that loss of freedom who keep we now a hundred year later free who keep our world from nuclear destruction

 and if we fail they probably will not get to read the letter at all because it speak of individual freedom and they will not be allow to talk of that or read of it

 this be our challenge and this be why we be here in this hall tonight well than we have ever do before we have get to quit talk to each other and about each other and go out and communicate to the world that we may be few in number than we have ever be but we carry the message they be wait for we must go forth from here united determined and what a great general say a few year ago be true there be no substitute for victory mr. president





i be edwin newman moderator of this first debate of the 1976 campaign between gerald r. ford of michigan republican candidate for president and jimmy carter of georgia democratic candidate for president

 we thank you president ford and we thank you governor carter for be with we tonight

 there be to be three debate between the presidential candidate and one between the vice presidential candidate all be be arrange by the league of women voters education fund

 tonight 's debate the first between presidential candidate in 16 year and the first ever in which an incumbent president have participate be take place before an audience in the walnut street theatre in philadelphia just 3 block from independence hall the television audience may reach 100 million in the united states and many million overseas

 tonight 's debate focus on domestic and economic policy question will be put by frank reynolds of abc news james gannon of the wall street journal and elizabeth drew of the new yorker magazine

 under the agree rule the first question will go to governor carter that be decide by the toss of a coin he will have up to 3 minute to answer one follow up question will be permit with up to 2 minute to reply president ford will then have 2 minute to respond

 the next question will go to president ford with the same time arrangement and question will continue to be alternate between the candidate each man will make a 3 minute statement at the end governor carter to go first

 president ford and governor carter do not have any note or prepare remark with they this evening

 mr. reynolds your question for governor carter

 mr reynolds mr. president governor carter

 governor in an interview with the associated press last week you say you believe these debate would alleviate a lot of concern that some voter have about you well one of those concern not an uncommon one about candidate in any year be that many voter say they do not really know where you stand

 now you have make job your number one priority and you have say you be committed to a drastic reduction in unemployment can you say now governor in specific term what your first step would be next january if you be elect to achieve that

 mr carter yes first of all it be to recognize the tremendous economic strength of this country and to set the putting back to work of our people as a top priority this be an effort that ought to be do primarily by strong leadership in the white house the inspiration of our people the tap of business agriculture industry labor and government at all level to work on this project we will never have an end to the inflationary spiral and we will never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work

 there be several thing that can be do specifically that be not now be do first of all to channel research and development fund into area that will provide large number of job secondly we need to have a commitment in the private sector to cooperate with government in matter like housing here a very small investment of taxpayer money in the housing field can bring large number of extra job in the guarantee of mortgage loan in the putting forward of 202 program for housing for old people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exist in the construction industry

 another thing be to deal with our need in the central city where the unemployment rate be extremely high sometimes among minority group those who do not speak english or who be black or young people a 40 percent unemployment here a ccc civilian conservation corps]-type program would be appropriate to channel money into the sharing with private sector and also local and state government to employ young people who be now out of work

 another very important aspect of our economy would be to increase production in every way possible to hold down taxis on individual and to shift the tax burden on to those who have avoid pay taxis in the past

 these kind of specific thing none of which be be do now would be a great help in reduce unemployment

 there be an additional factor that need to be do and cover very succinctly and that be to make sure that we have a good relationship between management business on the one hand and labor on the other

 in a lot of place where unemployment be very high we might channel specific target job opportunity by pay part of the salary of unemployed people and also share with local government the payment of salary which would let we cut down the unemployment rate much lower before we hit the inflationary level

 but i believe that by the end of the first 4 year of the next term we could have the unemployment rate down to 3 percent adult unemployment which be about 4 to 4 percent overall a control inflation rate and have a balanced growth of about 4 to 6 percent around 5 percent which would give we a balanced budget

 mr reynolds governor in the event you be successful and you do achieve a drastic drop in unemployment that be likely to create additional pressure on price how willing be you to consider an income policy in other word wage and price control

 mr carter well we now have such a low utilization of our productive capacity about 73 percent i think it be about the low since the great depression year and such a high unemployment rate now-7.9 percent that we have a long way to go in get people to work before we have the inflationary pressure and i think this would be easy to accomplish to get job now without have the strong inflationary pressure that would be necessary

 i would not favor the payment of a give fix income to people unless they be not able to work but with tax incentive for the low income group we could build up their income level above the poverty level and not make welfare more profitable than work

 the moderator mr. president your response


 the president i do not believe that mr. carter have be any more specific in this case than he have be on many other instance i notice particularly that he do not endorse the humphrey hawkins bill which he have on occasion and which be include as a part of the democratic platform that legislation allegedly would help our unemployment but we all know that it would have control our economy it would have add $ 10 to $ 30 billion each year in additional expenditure by the federal government it would have call for export control on agricultural product

 in my judgment the good way to get job be to expand the private sector where five out of six job today exist in our economy we can do that by reduce federal taxis as i propose about a year ago when i call for a tax reduction of $ 28 billion three quarter of it to go to private taxpayer and one quarter to the business sector we could add to job in the major metropolitan area by a proposal that i recommend that would give tax incentive to business to move into the inner city and to expand or to build new plant so that they would take a plant or expand a plant where people be and people be currently unemployed

 we could also help our youth with some of the proposal that would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like we give money to young people who be go to college

 those be the kind of specific that i think we have to discuss on these debate and these be the kind of program that i will talk about on my time

 the moderator mr. gannon your question to president ford

 mr gannon mr. president i would like to continue for a moment on this question of taxis which you have just raise you have say that you favor more tax cut for middle income americans even those earn up to $ 30,000 a year that presumably would cost the treasury quite a bit of money in lose revenue

 in view of the very large budget deficit that you have accumulate and that be still in prospect how be it possible to promise further tax cut and to reach your goal of balance the budget

 the president at the time mr. gannon that i make the recommendation for a $ 28 billion tax cut three quarter of it to go to individual taxpayer and 25 percent to american business i say at the same time that we have to hold the lid on federal spending that for every dollar of a tax reduction we have to have an equal reduction in federal expenditure a one for one proposition and i recommend that to the congress with a budget ceiling of $ 395 billion and that would have permit we to have a $ 28 billion tax reduction

 in my tax reduction program for middle income taxpayer i recommend that the congress increase personal exemption from $ 750 per person to $ 1,000 per person that would mean of course that for a family of four that that family would have $ 1,000 more personal exemption money that they could spend for their own purpose money that the government would not have to spend but if we keep the lid on federal spending which i think we can with the help of the congress we can justify fully a $ 28 billion tax reduction

 in the budget that i submit to the congress in january of this year i recommend a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending for the last 10 year the budget of the united states have grow from about 11 percent per year we can not afford that kind of growth in federal spending and in the budget that i recommend we cut it in half a growth rate of 5 to 5 1/2 percent with that kind of limitation on federal spending we can fully justify the tax reduction that i have propose and it seem to i with the stimulant of more money in the hand of the taxpayer and with more money in the hand of business to expand to modernize to provide more job our economy will be stimulate so that we will get more revenue and we will have a more prosperous economy

 mr gannon mr. president to follow up a moment the congress have pass a tax bill which be before you now which do not meet exactly the sort of outline that you request what be your intention on that bill since it do not meet your requirement do you plan to sign that bill

 the president that tax bill do not entirely meet the criterion that i establish i think the congress should have add another $ 10 billion reduction in personal income taxis include the increase of personal exemption from $ 750 to $ 1,000 and congress could have do that if the budget committee of the congress and the congress as a whole have not increase the spending that i recommend in the budget i be sure you know that in the resolution pass by the congress they have add about $ 17 billion in more spending by the congress over the budget that i recommend so i would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending

 now this tax bill that have not reach the white house yet but be expect in a day or two it be about 1,500 page it have some good provision in it it have leave out some that i have recommend unfortunately on the other hand when you have a bill of that magnitude with those many provision a president have to sit and decide if there be more good than bad and from the analysis that i have make so far it seem to i that that tax bill do justify my signature and my approval

 the moderator governor carter your response

 mr carter well mr. ford be change considerably his previous philosophy the present tax structure be a disgrace to this country it be just a welfare program for the rich as a matter of fact 25 percent of the total tax deduction go for only 1 percent of the rich people in this country and over 50 percent of the tax credit go for the 14 percent of the rich people in this country

 when mr. ford first become president in august of 1974 the first thing he do in october be to ask for a $ 4.7 billion increase in taxis on our people in the midst of the heavy recession since the great depression of the 1940 's in january of 1975 he ask for a tax change a $ 5.6 billion increase on low and middle income private individual a $ 6 1/2 billion decrease on the corporation and the special interest in december of 1975 he veto the roughly $ 18 to $ 20 billion tax reduction bill that have be pass by the congress and then he come back later on in january of this year and he do advocate a $ 10 billion tax reduction but it would be offset by a $ 6 billion increase this come january in deduction for social security payment and for unemployment compensation

 the whole philosophy of the republican party include my opponent have be to pile on taxis on low income people to take they off on the corporation as a matter of fact since the late sixty when mr. nixon take office we have have a reduction in the percentage of taxis pay by corporation from 30 percent down to about 20 percent we have have an increase in taxis pay by individual payroll taxis from 14 percent up to 20 percent this be what the republicans have do to we this be why tax reform be so important

 the moderator mrs. drew your question to governor carter

 ms drew governor carter you have propose a number of new or enlarged program include job and health welfare reform child care aid to education aid to city change in social security and housing subsidy you have also say that you want to balance the budget by the end of your first term now you have not put a price tag on those program but even if we price they conservatively and we count for full employment by the end of your first term and we count for the economic growth that would occur during that period there still be not enough money to pay for those program and balance the budget by any estimate that i have be able to see so in that case what would give

 mr carter well as a matter of fact there be if we assume a rate of growth of our economy equivalent to what it be during president johnson and president kennedy even before the vietnamese war and if we assume that at the end of the 4 year period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 percent under those circumstance even assume no elimination of unnecessary program and assume an increase in the allotment of money to finance program increase as the inflation rate do my economic project i think confirm by the house and the senate committee have be with a $ 60 billion extra amount of money that can be spend in fiscal year 81 which would be the last year of this next term within that $ 60 billion increase there would be fit the program that i promise the american people i might say too that if we see that these goal can not be reach and i believe they be reasonable goal then i would cut back on the rate of implementation of new program in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal year 81 which be the last year of the next term

 i believe that we ought to have a balanced budget during normal economic circumstance and these projection have be very carefully make i stand behind they and if they should be in error slightly on the down side then i will phase in the program that we have advocate more slowly

 ms. drew governor accord to the budget committee of the congress that you refer to if we get to full employment what they project at a 4 percent unemployment and as you say even allow for the inflation in the program there would not be anything more than a surplus of $ 5 billion by 1981 conservative estimate of your program would be that they would be about $ 85 to $ 100 billion so how do you say that you be go to be able to do these thing and balance the budget

 mr carter well the assumption that you have describe that be different be in the rate of growth of our economy

 ms drew no they take that into account in those figure

 mr carter i believe that it be accurate to say that the committee to whom you refer with the employment rate that you state and with the 5 to 5 1/2 percent growth rate in our economy that the projection would be a $ 60 billion increase in the amount of money that we have to spend in 1981 compare to now

 and in that framework would be fit any improvement in the program now this do not include any extra control over unnecessary spending the weed out of obsolete or obsolescent program we will have a safety version build in with complete reorganization of the executive branch of government which i be pledge to do

 the present bureaucratic structure of the federal government be a mess and if i be elect president that be go to be a top priority of mine to completely revise the structure of the federal government to make it economical efficient purposeful and manageable for a change and also i be go to institute zero base budgeting which i use 4 year in georgia which assess every program every year and eliminate those program that be obsolete or obsolescent

 but with these projection we will have a balanced budget by fiscal year 1981 if i be elect president keep my promise to the american people and it be just predicate on very modest but i think accurate projection of employment increase and a growth in our national economy equal to what be experience under kennedy johnson before the vietnam war

 the moderator president ford

 the president if it be true that there will be a $ 60 billion surplus by fiscal year 1981 rather than spend that money for all the new program that governor carter recommend and endorse and which be include in the democratic platform i think the american taxpayer ought to get an additional tax break a tax reduction of that magnitude i feel that the taxpayer be the one that need the relief i do not think we should add additional program of the magnitude that governor carter talk about

 it seem to i that our tax structure today have rate that be too high but i be very glad to point out have since 1969 during a republican administration we have have 10 million people take off of the tax roll at the low end of the taxpayer area and at the same time assume that i sign the tax bill that be mention by mr. gannon we will in the last two tax bill have increase the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayer

 and i believe that by eliminate 10 million taxpayer in the last 8 year and by put a heavy tax burden on those in the high tax bracket plus the other action that have be take we can give taxpayer adequate tax relief

 now it seem to i that as we look at the recommendation of the budget committee and our own projection there be not go to be any $ 60 billion dividend i have hear of those dividend in the past it always happen we expect one at the time of the vietnam war but it be use up before we ever end the war and taxpayer never get the adequate relief they deserve

 the moderator mr. reynolds

 mr reynolds mr. president when you come into office you speak very eloquently of the need for a time for healing and very early in your administration you go out to chicago and you announce you propose a program of case by case pardon for draft resister to restore they to full citizenship some 14,000 young man take advantage of your offer but another 90,000 do not in grant the pardon to former president nixon sir part of your rationale be to put watergate behind we to if i may quote you again truly end our long national nightmare

 why do not the same rationale apply now today in our bicentennial year to the young man who resist in vietnam and many of they still in exile abroad

 the president the amnesty program that i recommend in chicago in september of 1974 would give to all draft evader and military deserter the opportunity to earn their good record back about 14 to 15,000 do take advantage of that program we give they ample time i be against an across the board pardon of draft evader or military deserter

 now in the case of mr. nixon the reason the pardon be give be that when i take office this country be in a very very divided condition there be hatre there be divisiveness people have lose faith in their government in many many respect mr. nixon resign and i become president it seem to i that if i be to adequately and effectively handle the problem of high inflation a grow recession the involvement of the united states still in vietnam that i have to give 100 percent of my time to those two major problem

 mr. nixon resign that be disgrace the first president out of 38 that ever resign from public office under pressure so when you look at the penalty that he pay and when you analyze the requirement that i have to spend all of my time work on the economy which be in trouble that i inherit work on our problem in southeast asia which be still plague we it seem to i that mr. nixon have be penalize enough by his resignation in disgrace and the need and necessity for i to concentrate on the problem of the country fully justify the action that i take

 mr reynolds i take it then sir that you do not believe that you be go to reconsider and think about those 90,000 who be still abroad have they not be penalize enough many of they have be there for year

 the president well mr. carter have indicate that he would give a blanket pardon to all draft evader i do not agree with that point of view i give in september of 1974 an opportunity for all draft evader all deserter to come in voluntarily clear their record by earn an opportunity to restore their good citizenship i think we give they a good opportunity i do not think we should go any far

 the moderator governor carter

 mr carter well i think it be very difficult for president ford to explain the difference between the pardon of president nixon and his attitude toward those who violate the draft law as a matter of fact now i do not advocate amnesty i advocate pardon there be a difference in my opinion and in accordance with the ruling of the supreme court and in accordance with the definition in the dictionary

 amnesty mean that what you do be right pardon mean that what you do whether it be right or wrong you be forgive for it and i do advocate a pardon for draft evader i think it be accurate to say that 2 year ago when mr. ford put in this amnesty that three time as many deserter be excuse as be the one who evade the draft

 but i think that now be the time to heal our country after the vietnam war and i think that what the people be concern about be not the pardon or the amnesty of those who evade the draft but whether or not our crime system be fair

 we have get a sharp distinction draw between white collar crime the big shot who be rich who be influential very seldom go to jail those who be poor and who have no influence quite often be the one who be punish and the whole subject of crime be one that concern our people very much and i believe that the fairness of it be what be the major problem that address our leader and this be something that have not be address adequately by this administration

 but i hope to have a complete responsibility on my shoulder to help bring about a fair criminal justice system and also to bring about an end to the divisiveness that have occur in our country as a result of the vietnam war

 the moderator mr. gannon

 mr gannon governor carter you have promise a sweeping overhaul of the federal government include a reduction in the number of government agency you say would go down to about 200 from some 1,900 that sound indeed like a very deep cut in the federal government but be not it a fact that you be not really talk about few federal employee or less government spending but rather that you be talk about reshape the federal government not make it small

 mr carter well i have be through this before mr. gannon as the governor of georgia when i take over we have a bureaucratic mess like we have in washington now and we have 300 agency department bureau commission some fully budget some not but all have responsibility to carry out that be in conflict and we cut those 300 agency and so forth down substantially we eliminate 278 of they we set up a simple structure of government that could be administer fairly and it be a tremendous success it have not be undo since i be there

 it result also in an ability to reshape our court system our prison system our education system our mental health program and a clear assignment of responsibility and authority and also to have our people once again understand and control our government

 i intend to do the same thing if i be elect president when i get to washington come in as an outsider one of the major responsibility that i will have on my shoulder be a complete reorganization of the executive branch of government

 we now have a greatly expand white house staff when mr. nixon go in office for instance we have $ 3 1/2 million spend on the white house and its staff that have escalate now to $ 16 million in the last republican administration this need to be change we need to put the responsibility back on the cabinet member we also need to have a great reduction in agency and program for instance we now have in the health area 302 different program administer by 11 major department and agency sixty other advisory commission be responsible for this medicaid be in one agency medicare be in a different one the check on the quality of health care be in a different one none of they be responsible for health care itself this make it almost impossible for we to have a good health program

 we have just advocate this past week a consolidation of the responsibility for energy our country now have no comprehensive energy program or policy we have 20 different agency in the federal government responsible for the production the regulation the information about energy the conservation of energy spread all over government this be a gross waste of money so tough competent management of government give we a simple efficient purposeful and manageable government will be a great step forward and if i be elect and i intend to be then it be go to be do

 mr gannon well i would like to press my question on the number of federal employee whether you would really plan to reduce the overall number or merely put they in different department and relabel they in your energy plan you consolidate a number of agency into one or you would but do that really change the overall

 mr carter i can not say for sure that we would have few federal employee when i go out of office than when i come in it take i about 3 year to completely reorganize the georgia government the last year i be in office our budget be actually less than it be a year before which show a great improvement

 also we have a 2 percent increase in the number of employee the last year but it be a tremendous shift from administrative job into the delivery of service for instance we completely revise our prison system we establish 84 new mental health treatment center and we shift people out of administrative job into the field to deliver well service the same thing will be do at the federal government level

 i accomplish this with substantial reduction in employee in some department for instance in the transportation department we cut back about 25 percent of the total number of employee in give our people well mental health care we increase the number of employee but the efficiency of it the simplicity of it the ability of people to understand their own government and control it be a substantial benefit derive from complete reorganization

 we have get to do this at the federal government level if we do not the bureaucratic mess be go to continue there be no way for our people now to understand what their government be there be no way to get the answer to a question when you come to washington to try to as a governor to try to begin a new program for your people like the treatment of drug addict i find there be 13 different federal agency that i have to go to to manage the drug treatment program in the georgia government we only have one agency responsible for drug treatment

 this be the kind of change that would be make and it would be of tremendous benefit in long range planning in tight budgeting save the taxpayer money make the government more efficient cut down on bureaucratic waste have a clear delineation of authority and responsibility of employee and give our people a well chance to understand and control their government

 the moderator president ford

 the president i think the record should show mr. newman that the bureau of census we check it just yesterday indicate that in the 4 year that governor carter be governor of the state of georgia expenditure by the government go up over 50 percent employee of the government in georgia during his term of office go up over 25 percent and the figure also show that the bond indebtedness of the state of georgia during his governorship go up over 20 percent

 and there be some very interesting testimony give by governor carter 's successor governor busbee before a senate committee a few month ago on how he find the medicaid program when he come into office follow governor carter he testify and these be his word the present governor of georgia he say he find the medicaid program in georgia in shamble

 now let i talk about what we have do in the white house as far as federal employee be concern the first order that i issue after i become president be to cut or eliminate the prospective 40,000 increase in federal employee that have be schedule by my predecessor and in the term that i have be president some 2 year we have reduce federal employment by 11,000

 in the white house staff itself when i become president we have roughly 540 employee we now have about 485 employee so we have make a rather significant reduction in the number of employee on the white house staff work for the president

 so i think our record of cut back employee plus the failure on the part of the governor 's program to actually save employment in georgia show which be the well plan

 the moderator mrs. drew

 ms. drew mr. president at vail after the republican convention you announce that you would now emphasize five new area among those be job and housing and health improve recreational facility for americans and you also add crime you also mention education

 for 2 year you have be tell we that we could not do very much in these area because we could not afford it and in fact we do have a $ 50 billion deficit now in rebuttal to governor carter a little bit early you say that if there be to be any surplus in the next few year you think it should be turn back to the people in the form of tax relief so how be you go to pay for any new initiative in these area you announce at vail you be go to now stress

 the president well in the last 2 year as i indicate before we have a very tough time we be face with heavy inflation over 12 percent we be face with substantial unemployment but in the last 24 month we have turn the economy around and we have bring inflation down to under 6 percent and we have add employment of about 4 million in the last 17 month to the point where we have 88 million people work in america today the most in the history of the country the net result be we be go to have some improvement in our receipt and i think we will have some decrease in our disbursement we expect to have a low deficit in fiscal year 1978

 we feel that with this improvement in the economy we feel with more receipt and few disbursement we can in a moderate way increase as i recommend over the next 10 year a new park program that would cost a billion and a half dollar double our national park system

 we have recommend that in the housing program we can reduce down payment and moderate monthly payment but that do not cost any more as far as the federal treasury be concern

 we believe that we can do a well job in the area of crime but that require tough sentencing mandatory certain prison sentence for those who violate our criminal law we believe that you can revise the federal criminal code which have not be revise in a good many year that do not cost any more money we believe that you can do something more effectively with a moderate increase in money in the drug abuse program

 we feel that in education we can have a slight increase not a major increase it be my understanding that governor carter have indicate that he approve of a $ 30 billion expenditure by the federal government as far as education be concern at the present time we be spend roughly $ 3,500 million i do not know where that money would come from

 but as we look at the quality of life program job health education crime recreation we feel that as we move forward with a healthy economy we can absorb the small necessary cost that will be require

 ms. drew but sir in the next few year would you try to reduce the deficit would you spend money for these program that you have just outline or would you as you say early return whatever surplus you get to the people in the form of tax relief

 the president we feel that with the program that i have recommend the additional $ 10 billion tax cut with the moderate increase in the quality of life area we can still have a balanced budget which i will submit to the congress in january of 1978 we will not wait 1 year or 2 year long as governor carter indicate

 as the economy improve and it be improve our gross national product this year will average about 6 percent increase over last year we will have a low rate of inflation for the calendar year this year something slightly under 6 percent employment will be up revenue will be up we will keep the lid on some of these program that we can hold down as we have a little extra money to spend for those quality of life program which i think be need and necessary

 now i can not and would not endorse the kind of program that governor carter recommend he endorse the democratic platform which as i read it call for approximately 60 additional program we estimate that those program would add $ 100 billion minimum and probably $ 200 billion maximum each year to the federal budget those program you can not afford and give tax relief

 we feel that you can hold the line and restrain federal spending give a tax reduction and still have a balanced budget by 1978

 the moderator governor carter

 mr carter well mr. ford take the same attitude that the republicans always take in the last 3 month before an election they be always for the program that they fight the other 3 1/2 year i remember when herbert hoover be against job for people i remember when all landon be against social security and later president nixon-16 year ago be tell the public that john kennedy 's proposal would bankrupt the country and would double the cost

 the good thing to do be to look at the record of mr. ford 's administration and mr. nixon 's before his

 we have last year a $ 65 billion deficit the large deficit in the history of our country more of a deficit spending than we have in the entire 8 year period under president johnson and president kennedy we have get 500,000 more americans out of job today than be out of work 3 month ago and since mr. ford have be in office in 2 year we have have a 50 percent increase in unemployment from 5 million people out of work to 2 1/2 million more people out of work or a total of 7 1/2 million we have also get a comparison between himself and mr. nixon he be get four time the size of the deficit that mr. nixon even have himself

 this talk about more people at work be distort because with the 14 percent increase in the cost of live in the last 2 year it mean that woman and young people have have to go to work when they do not want to because their father could not make enough to pay the increase cost of food and housing and clothing

 we have in this last 2 year alone $ 120 billion total deficit under president ford and at the same time we have have in the last 8 year a doubling in the number of bankruptcy for small business we have have a negative growth in our national economy measure in real dollar the take home pay of a worker in this country be actually less now than it be in 1968 measure in real dollar this be the kind of record that be there and talk about the future and a drastic change or conversion on the part of mr. ford at the last minute be one that just do not go

 the moderator mr. reynolds

 mr reynolds governor carter i would like to turn to what we use to call the energy crisis

 yesterday a british government commission on air pollution but one head by a nuclear physicist recommend that any further expansion of nuclear energy be delay in britain as long as possible now this be a subject that be quite controversial among our own people and there seem to be a clear difference between you and the president on the use of nuclear power plant which you say you would use as a last priority why sir be they unsafe

 mr carter well among my other experience in the past i have be a nuclear engineer and i do graduate work in this field i think i know the capability and limitation of atomic power

 but the energy policy of our nation be one that have not yet be establish under this administration i think almost every other developed nation in the world have an energy policy except we

 we have see the federal energy agency administration establish for instance in the crisis of 1973 it be suppose to be a temporary agency now it be permanent it be enormous it be grow every day and i think the wall street journal report not too long ago they have 112 public relation expert work for the federal energy agency administration to try to justify to the american people its own existence

 we have get to have a firm way to handle the energy question the reorganization proposal that i have put forward be one first step in addition to that we need to have a realization that we have get about 35 year worth of oil leave in the whole world we be go to run out of oil when mr. nixon make his famous speech on operation independence we be import about 35 percent of our oil now we have increase that amount 25 percent we now import about 44 percent of our oil

 we need a shift from oil to coal we need to concentrate our research and development effort on coal burning and extraction that be safe for miner that also be clean burning we need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measure and then as a last resort only continue to use atomic power

 i would certainly not cut out atomic power altogether we can not afford to give up that opportunity until later but to the extent that we continue to use atomic power i would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precaution be initiate and maintain for instance some that have be forget we need to have the reactor core below ground level the entire powerplant that use atomic power tightly seal and a heavy vacuum maintain there ought to be a standardized design there ought to be a full time atomic energy specialist independent of the power company in the control room full time 24 hour a day to shut down a plant if an abnormality develop these kind of procedure along with evacuation procedure adequate insurance ought to be initiate

 so shift from oil to coal emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power strict conservation measure not yield every time the special interest group put pressure on the president like this administration have do and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strict possible safety precaution that be the good overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it

 mr reynolds well governor on the same subject would you require mandatory conservation effort to try to conserve fuel

 mr carter yes i would some of the thing that can be do about this be a change in the rate structure of electric power company we now encourage people to waste electricity by give the low rate to the big user we do not do anything to cut down on peak load requirement we do not have an adequate requirement for the insulation of home for the efficiency of automobile and whenever the automobile manufacturer come forward and say they can not meet the limit that the congress have put forward this republican administration have delay the implementation date

 in addition to that we ought to have a shift to the use of coal particularly in the appalachian region where the coal be locate a lot of very high quality low carbon coal i mean low sulfur coal be there it be where our employment be need this would help a great deal

 so mandatory conservation measure yes encouragement by the president for people to voluntarily conserve yes and also the private sector ought to be encourage to bring forward to the public the benefit from efficiency one bank in washington for instance give low interest loan for people who adequately insulate their home or who buy efficient automobile and some major manufacture company like dow chemical have through very effective efficiency mechanism cut down the use of energy by as much as 40 percent with the same out product

 these kind of thing ought to be do they ought to be encourage and support and even require by the government yes

 the moderator president ford

 the president governor carter skim over a very serious and a very broad subject in january of 1975 i submit to the congress and to the american people the first comprehensive energy program recommend by any president it call for an increase in the production of energy in the united states it call for conservation measure so that we would save the energy that we have

 if you be go to increase domestic oil and gas production and we have to you have to give to those producer an opportunity to develop their land or their well i recommend to the congress that we should increase coal production in this country from 600 million ton a year to 1,200 million ton by 1985 in order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground we have to improve our utilization of coal make it more efficient make it clean

 in addition we have to expand our research and development in my program for energy independence we have increase for example solar energy research from about $ 84 million a year to about $ 120 million a year we be go as fast as the expert say we should in nuclear power we have increase the research and development under the energy research and development agency administration very substantially to ensure that our nuclear power plant be safe that they be more efficient and that we have adequate safeguard

 i think you have to have great oil and gas production more coal production more nuclear production and in addition you have to have energy conservation

 the moderator mr. gannon

 mr gannon mr. president i would like to return for a moment to this problem of unemployment you have veto or threaten to veto a number of job bill pass or in development in the democratic control congress yet at the same time the government be pay out i think it be $ 17 billion perhaps $ 20 billion a year in unemployment compensation cause by the high unemployment why do you think it be well to pay out unemployment compensation to idle people than to put they to work in public service job

 the president the bill that i have veto the one for an additional $ 6 billion be not a bill that would have solve our unemployment problem even the proponent of it admit that no more than 400,000 job would be make available our analysis indicate that something in the magnitude of about 150 to 200,000 job would be make available each one of those job would have cost the taxpayer $ 25,000 in addition the job would not be available right now they would not have materialize for about 9 to 18 month

 the immediate problem we have be to stimulate our economy now so that we can get rid of unemployment what we have do be to hold the lid on spending in an effort to reduce the rate of inflation and we have prove i think very conclusively that you can reduce the rate of inflation and increase job

 for example as i have say we have add some 4 million job in the last 17 month we have now employ 88 million people in america the large number in the history of the united states we have add 500,000 job in the last 2 month

 inflation be the quick way to destroy job and by hold the lid on federal spending we have be able to do a good job an affirmative job in inflation and as a result have add to the job in this country

 i think it be also appropriate to point out that through our tax policy we have stimulate add employment throughout the country the investment tax credit the tax incentive for expansion and modernization of our industrial capacity it be my opinion that the private sector where five out of the six job be where you have permanent job with the opportunity for advancement be a well place than make work job under the program recommend by the congress

 mr gannon just to follow up mr. president the congress have just pass a $ 3.7 billion appropriation bill which would provide money for the public work job program that you early try to kill by your veto of the authorization legislation

 in light of the fact that unemployment again be rise or have in the past 3 month i wonder if you have rethought that question at all whether you would consider allow this program to be fund or will you veto that money bill

 the president well that bill have not yet come down to the oval office so i be not in a position to make any judgment on it tonight but that be an extra $ 4 billion that would add to the deficit which would add to the inflationary pressure which would help to destroy job in the private sector not make job where the job really be these make work temporary job dead end as they be be not the kind of job that we want for our people

 i think it be interesting to point out that in the 2 year that i have be president i have veto 56 bill congress have sustain 42 veto as a result we have save over $ 9 billion in federal expenditure and the congress by override the bill that i do veto the congress have add some $ 13 billion to the federal expenditure and to the federal deficit

 now governor carter complain about the deficit that this administration have have and yet he condemn the veto that i have make that have save the taxpayer $ 9 billion and could have save an additional $ 13 billion now he can not have it both way and therefore it seem to i that we should hold the lid as we have to the good of our ability so we can stimulate the private economy and get the job where the job be five out of six in this economy

 the moderator governor carter

 mr carter well mr. ford do not seem to put into perspective the fact that when 500,000 more people be out of work then there be 3 month ago where we have 2 million more people out of work than be when he take office that this touch human being

 i be in a city in pennsylvania not too long ago near here and there be about 4,000 or 5,000 people in the audience it be on a train trip and i say how many adult here be out of work about a thousand raise their hand

 mr. ford actually have few people now in the private sector in nonfarm job than when he take office and still he talk about a success 7.9 percent unemployment be a terrible tragedy in this country

 he say he have learn how to match unemployment with inflation that be right we have get the high inflation we have have in 25 year right now except under this administration and that be 50 year ago and we have get the high unemployment we have have under mr. ford 's administration since the great depression this affect human being and his insensitivity in provide those people a chance to work have make this a welfare administration and not a work administration

 he have not save $ 9 billion with his veto it have only be a net saving of $ 4 billion and the cost in unemployment compensation welfare compensation and lose revenue have increase $ 23 billion in the last 2 year this be a typical attitude that really cause havoc in people 's life and then it be cover over by say that our country have naturally get a 6 percent unemployment rate or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation it be a travesty it show a lack of leadership and we have never have a president since the war between the states that veto more bill mr. ford have veto four time as many bill as mr. nixon per year and 11 of they have be overridden one of his bill that be overridden he only get one vote in the senate and seven vote in the house from republicans so this show a breakdown in leadership

 the moderator governor carter under the rule i must stop you

 mrs. drew

 ms drew governor carter i would like to come back to the subject of taxis you have say that you want to cut taxis for the middle- and low income group

 mr carter right

 ms drew but unless you be willing to do such thing as reduce the itemize deduction for charitable contribution or home mortgage payment or interest or taxis or capital gain you can not really raise sufficient revenue to provide an overall tax cut of any size so how be you go to provide that tax relief that you be talk about

 mr carter now we have such a grossly unbalanced tax system as i say early that it be a disgrace of all the tax benefit now 25 percent of they go to the 1 percent of the rich people in this country over 50 percent-53 to be exact percent of the tax benefit go to the 14 percent rich people in this country

 we have have a 50 percent increase in payroll deduction since mr. nixon go in office 8 year ago mr. ford have advocate since he have be in office over $ 5 billion in reduction for corporation special interest group and the very very wealthy who derive their income not from labor but from investment

 that have get to be change a few thing that can be do we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporation who invest overseas if they make $ 1 million in profit overseas they do not have to pay any of their taxis unless they bring their money back into this country where they do not pay their taxis the average american pay their taxis for they not only that but it rob this country of job because instead of come back with that million dollar and create a shoe factory say in new hampshire or vermont if the company take the money down to italy and build a shoe factory they do not have to pay any taxis on the money

 another thing be a system call disc domestic international sales corporation which be originally design and propose by mr. nixon to encourage export this permit a company to create a dummy corporation to export their product and then not to pay the full amount of taxis on they this cost our government about $ 1.4 billion a year and when those rich corporation do not pay that tax the average american taxpayer pay it for they

 another one that be very important be the business deduction jet airplane first class travel the $ 50 martini lunch the average work person can not take advantage of that but the wealthy people can

 another system be where a dentist can invest money in say raise cattle and can put in $ 100,000 of his own money borrow $ 900,000-$900,000 that make a million and mark off a great amount of loss through that procedure there be one example for instance where somebody produce pornographic movie they put in $ 30,000 of their own money and get $ 120,000 in tax saving

 these special kind of program have rob the average taxpayer and have benefit those who be powerful and who can employ lobbyist and who can have their c.p.a. 's and their lawyer to help they benefit from the roughly 8,000 page of the tax code the average american person can not do it you can not hire a lobbyist out of unemployment compensation check

 ms drew governor to follow up on your answer in order for any kind of tax relief to really be feel by the middle- and low income people accord to congressional committee on this you need about $ 10 billion now you list some thing the deferral on foreign income be estimate it would save about $ 500 million disc you say be $ 1.4 billion the estimate of the outside if you eliminate all tax shelter be $ 5 billion

 so where else would you raise the revenue to provide this tax relief would you in fact do away with all business deduction and what other kind of preference would you do away with

 mr carter no i would not do away with all business deduction i think that would be a very serious mistake but if you could just do away with the one that be unfair you could lower taxis for everyone i would never do anything that would increase the taxis for those who work for a living or who be presently require to list all their income

 what i want to do be not to raise taxis but to eliminate loophole and this be the point of my first statistic that i give you that the present tax benefit that have be carve out over a long period of years-50 year by sharp tax lawyer and by lobbyist have benefit just the rich these program that i describe to you early the tax deferral for overseas the disc and the tax shelter they only apply to people in the $ 50,000 a year bracket or up and i think this be the good way to approach it be to make sure that everybody pay taxis on the income that they earn and make sure that you take whatever saving there be from the high income level and give it to the low and middle income family

 the moderator president ford

 the president governor carter 's answer tonight do not coincide with the answer that he give in an interview to the associated press a week or so ago in that interview governor carter indicate that he would raise the taxis on those in the medium- or middle income bracket or high now if you take the medium- or middle income taxpayer that be about $ 14,000 per person governor carter have indicate publicly in an interview that he would increase the taxis on about 50 percent of the work people of this country

 i think the way to get tax equity in this country be to give tax relief to the middle income people who have an income from roughly $ 8,000 up to $ 25 or $ 30,000 they have be shortchange as we have take 10 million taxpayer off the tax roll in the last 8 year and as we have add to the minimum tax provision to make all people pay more taxis

 i believe in tax equity for the middle income taxpayer increase the personal exemption mr. carter want to increase taxis for roughly half of the taxpayer of this country

 now the governor have also play a little fast and loose with the fact about veto the record show that president roosevelt veto on an average of 55 bill a year president truman veto on the average while he be president about 38 bill a year i understand that governor carter when he be governor of georgia veto between 35 and 40 bill a year my average in 2 year be 26 but in the process of that we have save $ 9 billion

 and one final comment governor carter talk about the tax bill and all of the inequity that exist in the present law i must remind he the democrats have control the congress for the last 22 year and they write all the tax bill

 the moderator mr. reynolds

 mr reynolds i suspect that we could continue on this tax argument for some time but i would like to move on to another area

 mr. president everybody seem to be run against washington this year and i would like to raise two coincidental event then ask you whether you think perhaps this may have a bearing on the attitude throughout the country

 the house ethics committee have just now end its investigation of daniel schorr after several month and many thousand of dollar try to find out how he obtain and cause to be publish a report of the congress that probably be the property of the american people at the same time the senate select committee on standards and conduct have vote not really to begin an investigation of a united states senator because of allegation against he that he may have be receive corporate fund illegally over a period of year

 do you suppose sir that event like this contribute to the feeling in the country that maybe there be something wrong in washington and i do not mean just in the executive branch but throughout the whole government


 the president there be a considerable anti washington feel throughout the country but i think the feeling be misplace in the 2 year we have restore integrity in the white house and we have set high standard in the executive branch of the government

 the anti washington feeling in my opinion ought to be focus on the congress of the united states for example this congress very shortly will spend a billion dollar a year for its housekeeping its salary its expense and the like the next congress will probably be the first billion dollar congress in the history of the united states i do not think the american people be get their money 's worth from the majority party that run this congress we in addition see that in the last 4 year the number of employee hire by the congress have go up substantially much more than the gross national product much more than any other increase throughout our society congress be hire people by the drove and the cost as a result have go up

 and i do not see any improvement in the performance of the congress under the present leadership so it seem to i instead of the anti washington feeling be aim at everybody in washington it seem to i that the focus should be where the problem be which be the congress of the united states and particularly the majority in the congress

 they spend too much money on themselves they have too many employee there be some question about their morality it seem to i that in this election the focus should not be on the executive branch but the correction should come as the voter for their member of the house of representatives or for their united states senator that be where the problem be and i hope there will be some corrective action take so we can get some new leadership in the congress of the united states

 mr reynolds mr. president if i may follow up i think you have make it plain that you take a dim view of the majority in the congress be not it quite likely sir that you will have a democratic congress in the next session if you be elect president and have not the country a right to ask whether you can get along with that congress or whether we will have continue confrontation

 the president well it seem to i that we have a chance the republicans to get a majority in the house of representatives we will make some gain in the united states senate so there will be different ratio in the house as well as in the senate and as president i will be able to work with that congress

 but let i take the other side of the coin if i might suppose we have have a democratic congress for the last 2 year and we have have governor carter as president he have in effect say that he would agree with all of he would disapprove of the veto that i have make and would have add significantly to expenditure and the deficit in the federal government i think it would be contrary to one of the basic concept in our system of government a system of check and balance

 we have a democratic congress today and fortunately we have have a republican president to check their excess with my veto if we have a democratic congress next year and a president who want to spend an additional $ 100 billion a year or maybe $ 200 billion a year with more program we will have in my judgment great deficit with more spending more danger of inflation

 i think the american people want a republican president to check on any excess that come out of the next congress if it be a democratic congress

 the moderator governor carter

 mr carter well it be not a matter of republican and democrat it be a matter of leadership or no leadership president eisenhower work with a democratic congress very well even president nixon because he be a strong leader at least work with a democratic congress very well

 mr. ford have veto as i say early four time as many bill per year as mr. nixon mr. ford quite often put forward a program just as a public relation stunt and never try to put it through the congress by work with the congress i think under president nixon and eisenhower they pass about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation this year mr. ford will not pass more than 26 percent of all the legislative proposal he put forward

 this be government by stalemate and we have see almost a complete breakdown in the proper relationship between the president who represent this country and the congress who collectively also represent this country

 we have have republican presidents before who have try to run against a democratic congress and i do not think it's the congress be mr. ford 's opponent but if he insist that i be responsible for the democratic congress of which i have not be a part then i think it be only fair that he be responsible for the nixon administration in its entirety of which he be a part that i think be a good balance

 but the point be that a president ought to lead this country mr. ford so far as i know except for avoid another watergate have not accomplish one single major program for his country and there have be a constant squabbling between the president and the congress and that be not the way this country ought to be run

 i might go back to one other thing mr. ford have misquote an ap news story that be in error to begin with that story report several time that i would lower taxis for lower- and middle income family and that correction be deliver to the white house and i be sure that the president know about this correction but he still insist on repeat an erroneous statement

 the moderator president ford governor carter we no long have enough time for two complete sequence of question we have only about 6 minute leave for question and answer for that reason we will drop the follow up question at this point but each candidate will still be able to respond to the other 's answer

 to the extent that you can gentleman please keep your remark brief

 mr gannon governor carter one important part of the government 's economic policy apparatus we have not talk about be the federal reserve board i would like to ask you something about what you have say and that be that you believe that a president ought to have a chairman of the federal reserve board whose view be compatible with his own

 base on the record of the last few year would you say that your view be compatible with those of chairman arthur burns and if not would you seek his resignation if you be elect

 mr carter what i have say be that the president ought to have a chance to appoint the chairman of the federal reserve board to have a coterminus term in other word both of they serve the same 4 year

 the congress can modify the supply of money by modify the income tax law the president can modify the economic structure of the country by public statement and general attitude and the budget that he propose the federal reserve have an independent status that ought to be preserve

 i think that mr. burns do take a typical erroneous republican attitude in the 1973 year when inflation be so high he assume that the inflation rate be because of excessive demand and therefore put into effect tight constraint on the economy very high interest rate which be typical also of a republican administration try to increase the tax payment by individual cut the tax payment by corporation i would have do it opposite i think the problem should have be address by increase productivity by having put people back to work so they could purchase more good low income taxis on individual perhaps raise they if necessary on corporation in comparison but mr. burns in that respect make a very serious mistake

 i would not want to destroy the independence of the federal reserve board but i do think we ought to have a cohesive economic policy with at least the chairman of the federal reserve board and the president 's term be the same and let the congress of course be the third entity with independence subject only to the president 's veto

 the moderator president ford your response

 the president the chairman of the federal reserve board should be independent fortunately he have be during democratic as well as republican administration as a result in the last 2 year we have have a responsible monetary policy

 the federal reserve board indicate that the supply of money would be hold between 4 to 4 1/2 and 7 and 7 1/2 they have do a good job in integrate the money supply with the fiscal policy of the executive and legislative branch of the government

 it would be catastrophic if the chairman of the federal reserve board become the tool of the political party that be in power it be important for our future economic security that that job be nonpolitical and separate from the executive and the legislative branch

 the moderator mrs. drew

 ms. drew mr. president the real problem with the fbi in fact all of the intelligence agency be there be no real law govern they such law as there be tend to be vague and open ended now you have issue some executive order but we have learn that leave these agency to executive discretion and direction can get they and in fact the country in a great deal of trouble one president may be a decent man the next one might not be

 so what do you think about try to write in some more protection by get some law govern these agency

 the president you be familiar of course with the fact that i be the first president in 30 year who have reorganize the intelligence agency in the federal government the cia the defense intelligence agency the national security agency and the other we have do that by executive order and i think we have tighten it up we have straighten out their problem that develop over the last few year it do not seem to i that it be need or necessary to have legislation in this particular regard

 i have recommend to the congress however i'm sure you be familiar with this legislation that would make it very proper and in the right way that the attorney general could go in and get the right for wiretappe under security case this be an effort that be make by the attorney general and myself work with the congress but even in this area where i think new legislation would be justify the congress have not respond

 so i feel in that case as well as in the reorganization of the intelligence agency as i have do we have to do it by executive order and i be glad that we have a good director in george bush we have good executive order and the cia and the dia and nsa be now do a good job under proper supervision

 the moderator governor carter

 mr carter well one of the very serious thing that be happen in our government in recent year and have continue up until now be a breakdown in the trust among our people in the at this point there be an audio failure which cause a delay in the debate until 11:18 p.m.

 the moderator lady and gentleman probably it be not necessary for i to say that we have a technical failure during the debate it be not a failure in the debate it be a failure in the broadcasting of the debate it occur 27 minute ago the fault have be deal with and we want to thank president ford and governor carter for be so patient and understanding while this delay go on

 we very much regret the technical failure that lose the sound as it be leave the theatre it occur during governor carter 's response to what would have be and what be the last question put to the candidate that question go to president ford it deal with the control of government intelligence agency governor carter be make his response and have very nearly finish it he will conclude that response now after which president ford and governor carter will make their closing statement

 mr carter there have be too much government secrecy and not enough respect for the personal privacy of american citizen

 the moderator it be now time for the closing statement which be to be up to 4 minute long

 governor carter by the same toss of the coin that direct the first question to you you be to go first now

 mr carter well tonight we have bad a chance to talk a lot about the past but i think it be time to talk about the future our nation in the last 8 year have be divide as never before it be a time for unity it be time to draw ourselves together to have a president and a congress that can work together with mutual respect for a change cooperate for a change in the open for a change so the people can understand their own government it be time for government industry and labor manufacturing agriculture education other entity in our society to cooperate and it be a time for government to understand and to cooperate with our people

 for a long time our american citizen have be exclude sometimes mislead sometimes have be lie to this be not compatible with the purpose of our nation i believe in our country it need to be competent the government need to be well manage efficient economical we need to have a government that be sensitive to our people 's need to those who be poor who do not have adequate health care who have be cheat too long by our tax program who have be out of job whose family have be tear apart we need to restore the faith and the trust of the american people in their own government

 in addition to that we have suffer because we have not have leadership in this administration we have get a government of stalemate we have lose the vision of what our country can and ought to be this be not the america that we have know in the past it be not the america that we have to have in the future

 i do not claim to know all the answer but i have get confidence in my country our economic strength be still there our system of government in spite of vietnam cambodia cia watergate be still the good system of government on earth and the great resource of all be the 215 million americans who still have within we the strength the character the intelligence the experience the patriotism the idealism the compassion the sense of brotherhood on which we can rely in the future to restore the greatness to our country

 we ought not to be exclude from our government anymore we need a president that can go in who derive his strength from the people i owe the special interest nothing i owe everything to you the people of this country and i believe that we can bind our wound i believe that we can work together and i believe that if we can tap the tremendous untapped reservoir of innate strength in this country that we can once again have a government as good as our people and let the world know what we still know and hope for that we still live in the great and the strong and the good country on earth

 the moderator president ford

 the president on november 2 all of you will make a very very important decision one of the major issue in this campaign be trust a president should never promise more than he can deliver and a president should always deliver everything that he have promise a president can not be all thing to all people a president should be the same thing to all people

 another issue in this campaign governor carter have endorse the democratic platform which call for more spending big deficit more inflation or more taxis governor carter have embrace the record of the present congress dominate by his political party it call for more of the same governor carter in his acceptance speech call for more and more program which mean more and more government i think the real issue in this campaign and that which you must decide on november 2 be whether you should vote for his promise or my performance in 2 year in the white house

 on the fourth of july we have a wonderful 200th birthday for our great country it be a superb occasion it be a glorious day

 in the first century of our nation 's history our forefather give we the fine form of government in the history of mankind in the second century of our nation 's history our forefather develop the most productive industrial nation in the history of the globe our third century should be the century of individual freedom for all our 215 million americans today and all that join we

 in the last few year government have get big and big industry have get large and large labor union have get big and big and our child have be the victim of mass education

 we must make this next century the century of the individual we should never forget that a government big enough to give we everything we want be a government big enough to take from we everything we have

 the individual worker in the plant throughout the united states should not be a small cog in a big machine the member of a labor union must have his right strengthen and broaden and our child in their education should have an opportunity to improve themselves base on their talent and their ability

 my mother and father during the depression work very hard to give i an opportunity to do well in our great country your mother and father do the same thing for you and other betty and i have work very hard to give our child a bright future in the united states our beloved country you and other in this great country have work hard and do a great deal to give your child and your grandchild the blessing of a well america i believe we can all work together to make the individual in the future have more and all of we work together can build a well america

 the moderator thank you president ford thank you governor carter our thank also to the questioner and to the audience in this theatre we much regret the technical failure that cause a 28 minute delay in the broadcast of the debate we believe however that everyone will agree that it do not detract from the effectiveness of the debate or from its fairness

 the next presidential debate be to take place on wednesday october 6 in san francisco at 9:30 p.m. eastern daylight time the topic be to be foreign and defense issue as with all three debate between the presidential candidate and the one between the vice presidential candidate it be be arrange by the league of women voters education fund in the hope of promote a wide and well inform participation by the american people in the election in november

 now from the walnut street theatre in philadelphia good night

good evening i be pauline frederick of npr national public radio moderator of the second of the historic debate of the 1976 campaign between gerald r. ford of michigan republican candidate for president and jimmy carter of georgia democratic candidate for president
 thank you president ford and thank you governor carter for be with we tonight

 the debate take place before an audience in the palace of fine arts theatre in san francisco an estimated 100 million americans be watch on television as well san francisco be the site of the signing of the united nations charter 31 year ago thus it be an appropriate place to hold this debate the subject of which be foreign and defense issue

 the questioner tonight be max frankel associate editor of the new york times henry l. trewhitt diplomatic correspondent of the baltimore sun and richard valeriani diplomatic correspondent of nbc news

 the ground rule tonight be basically the same as they be for the first debate 2 week ago the question will be alternate between candidate by the toss of a coin governor carter will take the first question

 each question sequence will be as follow the question will be ask and the candidate will have up to 3 minute to answer his opponent will have up to 2 minute to respond and prior to the response the questioner may ask a follow up question to clarify the candidate 's answer when necessary with up to 2 minute to reply each candidate will have 3 minute for a closing statement at the end

 president ford and governor carter do not have note or prepare remark with they this evening but they may take note during the debate and refer to they

 mr. frankel you have the first question for governor carter

 mr frankel governor since the democrats last run our foreign policy include many of the man who be advise you the country have be relieve of the vietnam agony and the military draft we have start arm control negotiation with the russians we have open relation with china we have arrange the disengagement in the middle east we have regain influence with the arabs without desert israel now maybe we have even begin a process of peaceful change in africa

 now you have object in this campaign to the style with which much of this be do and you have mention some other thing that you think ought to have be do but do you really have a quarrel with this republican record would you not have do any of those thing

 mr carter well i think this republican administration have be almost all style and spectacular and not substance we have get a chance tonight to talk about first of all leadership the character of our country and a vision of the future in every one of these instance the ford administration have fail and i hope tonight that i and mr. ford will have a chance to discuss the reason for those failure

 our country be not strong any more we be not respect any more we can only be strong overseas if we be strong at home and when i become president we will not only be strong in those area but also in defense a defense capability second to none

 we have lose in our foreign policy the character of the american people we have ignore or exclude the american people and the congress from participation in the shaping of our foreign policy it be be one of secrecy and exclusion

 in addition to that we have have a chance to become now contrary to our long stand belief and principle the arm merchant of the whole world we have try to buy success from our enemy and at the same time we have exclude from the process the normal friendship of our ally

 in addition to that we have become fearful to compete with the soviet union on an equal basis we talk about detente the soviet union know what they want in detente and they have be get it we have not know what we have want and we have be out trade in almost every instance

 the other point i want to make be about our defense we have get to be a nation bless with the defense capability that be efficient tough capable well organize narrowly focus fighting capability the ability to fight if necessary be the good way to avoid the chance for or the requirement to fight

 and the last point i want to make be this mr. ford mr. kissinger have continue on with the policy and failure of richard nixon even the republican platform have criticize the lack of leadership in mr. ford and they have criticize the foreign policy of this administration this be one instance where i agree with the republican platform

 i might say this in closing and that be that as far as foreign policy go mr. kissinger have be the president of this country mr. ford have show an absence of leadership and an absence of a grasp of what this country be and what it ought to be that be get to be change and that be one of the major issue in this campaign of 1976

 the moderator president ford would you like to respond

 the president governor carter again be talk in broad generality let i take just one question that he raise the military strength and capability of the united states governor carter in november of 1975 indicate that he want to cut the defense budget by $ 15 billion a few month later he say he want to cut the defense budget by $ 8 billion or $ 9 billion and more recently he talk about cut the defense budget by $ 5 billion to $ 7 billion there be no way you can be strong militarily and have those kind of reduction in our military appropriation

 now let i just tell you a little story about late october of 1975 i ask the then secretary of defense mr. schlesinger to tell i what have to be do if we be go to reduce the defense budget by $ 3 to $ 5 billion a few day later mr. schlesinger come back and say if we cut the defense budget by $ 3 to $ 5 billion we will have to cut military personnel by 250,000 civilian personnel by 100,000 job in america by 100,000 we would have to stretch out our aircraft procurement we would have to reduce our naval construction program we would have to reduce the research and development for the army the navy the air force and marines by 8 percent we would have to close 20 military basis in the united states immediately that be the kind of a defense program that mr. carter want

 let i tell you this straight from the shoulder you do not negotiate with mr. brezhnev from weakness and the kind of a defense program that mr. carter want will mean a weak defense and a poorer negotiating position

 the moderator mr. trewhitt a question for president ford

 mr trewhitt mr. president my question really be the other side of the coin from mr. frankel 's for a generation the united states have have a foreign policy base on containment of communism yet we have lose the first war in vietnam we lose a shoving match in angola communists threaten to come to power by peaceful mean in italy and relation generally have cool with the soviet union in the last few month so let i ask you first what do you do about such case as italy and secondly do this general drift mean that we be move back toward something like an old cold war relationship with the soviet union

 the president i do not believe we should move to a cold war relationship i think it be in the good interest of the united states and the world as a whole that the united states negotiate rather than go back to the cold war relationship with the soviet union

 i do not look at the picture as bleakly as you have indicate in your question mr. trewhitt i believe that the united states have have many success in recent year and recent month as far as the communist movement be concern we have be successful in portugal where a year ago it look like there be a very great possibility that the communists would take over in portugal it do not happen we have a democracy in portugal today

 a few month ago or i should say maybe 2 year ago the soviet union look like they have continue strength in the middle east today accord to prime minister rabin the soviet union be weak in the middle east than they have be in many many year the fact be the soviet union relationship with egypt be at a low level the soviet union relationship with syria be at a very low point the united states today accord to prime minister rabin of israel be at a peak in its influence and power in the middle east

 but let us turn for a minute to the southern african operation that be now go on the united states of america take the initiative in southern africa we want to end the bloodshed in southern africa we want to have the right of self determination in southern africa we want to have majority rule with the full protection of the right of the minority we want to pro serve human dignity in southern africa we have take initiative and in southern africa today the united states be trust by the black frontline nation and black africa the united states be trust by the other element in southern africa

 the united states foreign policy under this administration have be one of progress and success and i believe that instead of talk about soviet progress we can talk about american success

 and may i make an observation part of the question you ask mr. trewhitt i do not believe that it be in the good interest of the united states and the nato nation to have a communist government in nato mr. carter have indicate he would look with sympathy to a communist government in nato i think that would destroy the integrity and the strength of nato and i be totally opposed to it

 mr carter well mr. ford unfortunately have just make a statement that be not true i have never advocate a communist government for italy that would obviously be a ridiculous thing for anyone to do who want to be president of the country i think that this be an instance for deliberate distortion and this have occur also in the question about defense as a matter of fact i have never advocate any cut of $ 15 billion in our defense budget as a matter of fact mr. ford have make a political football out of the defense budget

 about a year ago he cut the pentagon budget $ 6.8 billion after he fire james schlesinger the political heat get so great that he add back about $ 3 billion when ronald reagan win the texas primary election mr. ford add back another $ 1 1/2 billion immediately before the kansas city convention he add back another $ 1.8 billion in the defense budget and his own office of management and budget testify that he have a $ 3 billion cut insurance add to the defense budget under the pressure from the pentagon obviously this be another indication of try to use the defense budget for political purpose which he be try to do tonight

 now we go into south africa late after great britain rhodesia the black nation have be try to solve this problem for many many year we do not go in until right before the election similar to what be take place in 1972 when mr. kissinger announce peace be at hand just before the election at that time

 and we have weaken our position in nato because the other country in europe support the democratic force in portugal long before we do we stick to the portugal dictatorship much long than other democracy do in this world

 the moderator mr. valeriani a question for governor carter

 mr valeriani governor carter much of what the united states do abroad be do in the name of the national interest what be your concept of the national interest what should the role of the united states in the world be and in that connection consider your limit experience in foreign affair and the fact that you take some pride in be a washington outsider do not you think it would be appropriate for you to tell the american voter before the election the people that you would like to have in key position such as secretary of state secretary of defense national security affair adviser at the white house

 mr carter well i be not go to name my cabinet before i get elect i have get a little way to go before i start do that but i have an adequate background i believe i be a graduate of the u.s. naval academy the first military graduate since eisenhower i have serve as governor of georgia and have travel extensively in foreign country in south america central america europe the middle east and in japan

 i have travel the last 21 month among the people of this country i have talk to they and i have listen and i have see at firsthand in a very vivid way the deep hurt that be come to this country in the aftermath of vietnam and cambodia and chile and pakistan and angola and watergate cia revelation

 what we be formerly so proud of the strength of our country its moral integrity the representation in foreign affair of what our people be what our constitution stand for have be go and in the secrecy that have surround our foreign policy in the last few year the american people and the congress have be exclude

 i believe i know what this country ought to be i have be one who be love my nation as many americans do and i believe that there be no limit place on what we can be in the future if we can harness the tremendous resource militarily economically and the stature of our people the meaning of our constitution in the future

 every time we have make a serious mistake in foreign affair it be be because the american people have be exclude from the process if we can just tap the intelligence and ability the sound commonsense and the good judgment of the american people we can once again have a foreign policy to make we proud instead of ashamed and i be not go to exclude the american people from that process in the future as mr. ford and kissinger have do

 this be what it take to have a sound foreign policy strong at home strong defense permanent commitment not betray the principle of our country and involve the american people and the congress in the shaping of our foreign policy

 every time mr. ford speak from a position of secrecy in negotiation and secret treaty that have be pursue and achieve in support dictatorship in ignore human right we be weak and the rest of the world know it

 so these be the way that we can restore the strength of our country and they do not require long experience in foreign policy nobody have that except a president who serve a long time or a secretary of state but my background my experience my knowledge of the people of this country my commitment to our principle that do not change those be the good basis to correct the horrible mistake of this administration and restore our own country to a position of leadership in the world

 mr valeriani how specifically governor be you go to bring the american people into the decisionmake process in foreign policy what do that mean

 mr carter first of all i would quit conduct the decisionmake process in secret as have be a characteristic of mr. kissinger and mr. ford in many instance we have make agreement like in vietnam that have be reveal later on to our embarrassment

 recently ian smith the president of rhodesia announce that he have unequivocal commitment from mr. kissinger that he could not reveal the american people do not know what those commitment be we have see in the past a destruction of elect government like in chile and the strong support of military dictatorship there these kind of thing have hurt we very much

 i would restore the concept of the fireside chat which be an integral part of the administration of franklin roosevelt and i would also restore the involvement of the congress when harry truman be president he be not afraid to have a strong secretary of defense dean acheson george marshall be strong secretaries of state excuse i state but he also make sure that there be a bipartisan support the members of congress arthur vandenburg walter george be part of the process and before our nation make a secret agreement and before we make a bluffing statement we be sure that we have the backing not only of the president and the secretary of state but also of the congress and the people this be a responsibility of the president and i think it be very damaging to our country for mr. ford to have turn over this responsibility to the secretary of state

 the moderator president ford do you have a response

 the president governor carter again contradict himself he complain about secrecy and yet he be quote as say that in the attempt to find a solution in the middle east that he would hold unpublicized meeting with the soviet union i presume for the purpose of impose a settlement on israel and the arab nation

 but let i talk just a minute about what we have do to avoid secrecy in the ford administration after the united states take the initiative in work with israel and with egypt and achieve the sinai ii agreement and i be proud to say that not a single egyptian or israeli soldier have lose his life since the signing of the sinai agreement but at the time that i submit the sinai agreement to the congress of the united states i submit every single document that be applicable to the sinai ii agreement it be the most complete documentation by any president of any agreement sign by a president on behalf of the united states

 now as far as meet with the congress be concern during the 24 month that i have be the president of the united states i have average well than one meeting a month with responsible group or committee of the congress both house and senate

 the secretary of state have appear in the several year that he be be the secretary before 80 different committee hearing in the house and in the senate the secretary of state have make well than 50 speech all over the united states explain american foreign policy i have make myself at least 10 speech in various part of the country where i have discuss with the american people defense and foreign policy

 the moderator mr. frankel a question for president ford

 mr frankel mr. president i would like to explore a little more deeply our relationship with the russians they use to brag back in khrushchev 's day that because of their great patience and because of our greed for business deal that they would soon or later get the well of we be it possible that despite some setback in the middle east they have prove their point our ally in france and italy be now flirt with communism we have recognize a permanent communist regime in east germany we virtually sign in helsinki an agreement that the russians have dominance in eastern europe we bail out soviet agriculture with our huge grain sale we have give they large loan access to our good technology and if the senate have not interfere with the jackson amendment maybe you would have give they even large loan be that what you call a two way street of traffic in europe

 the president i believe that we have negotiate with the soviet union since i have be president from a position of strength and let i cite several example

 shortly after i become president in december of 1974 i meet with general secretary brezhnev in vladivostok and we agree to a mutual cap on the ballistic missile launcher at a ceiling of 2,400 which mean that the soviet union if that become a permanent agreement will have to make a reduction in their launcher that they now have or plan to have i negotiate at vladivostok with mr. brezhnev a limitation on the mirving of their ballistic missile at a figure of 1,320 which be the first time that any president have achieve a cap either on launcher or on mirv 's

 it seem to i that we can go from there to the grain sale the grain sale have be a benefit to american agriculture we have achieve a 5 3/4 year sale of a minimum of 6 million metric ton which mean that they have already buy about 4 million metric ton this year and be bind to buy another 2 million metric ton to take the grain and corn and wheat that the american farmer have produce in order to have full production and these grain sale to the soviet union have help we tremendously in meet the cost of the additional oil and the oil that we have buy from overseas

 if we turn to helsinki i be glad you raise it mr. frankel in the case of helsinki 35 nation sign an agreement include the secretary of state for the vatican i can not under any circumstance believe that his holiness the pope would agree by sign that agreement that the 35 nation have turn over to the warsaw pact nation the domination of eastern europe it just be not true and if mr. carter allege that his holiness by sign that have do it he be totally inaccurate

 now what have be accomplish by the helsinki agreement number one we have an agreement where they notify we and we notify they of any military maneuver that be to be undertake they have do it in both case where they have do so there be no soviet domination of eastern europe and there never will be under a ford administration

 mr frankel i be sorry could i just follow do i understand you to say sir that the russians be not use eastern europe as their own sphere of influence and occupy most of the country there and make sure with their troop that it be a communist zone whereas on our side of the line the italians and the french be still flirt with the possibility of communism

 the president i do not believe mr. frankel that the yugoslavians consider themselves dominate by the soviet union i do not believe that the romanians consider themselves dominate by the soviet union i do not believe that the poles consider themselves dominate by the soviet union each of those country be independent autonomous it have its own territorial integrity and the united states do not concede that those country be under the domination of the soviet union as a matter of fact i visit poland yugoslavia and romania to make certain that the people of those country understand that the president of the united states and the people of the united states be dedicate to their independence their autonomy and their freedom

 the moderator governor carter have you a response

 mr carter well in the first place i be not criticize his holiness the pope i be talk about mr. ford

 the fact be that secrecy have surround the decision make by the ford administration in the case of the helsinki agreement it may have be a good agreement at the beginning but we have fail to enforce the so call basket 3 part which ensure the right of people to migrate to join their family to be free to speak out the soviet union be still jam radio free europe radio free europe be be jam

 we have also see a very serious problem with the so call sonnenfeldt document which apparently mr. ford have just endorse which say that there be an organic linkage between the eastern european country and the soviet union and i would like to see mr. ford convince the polish americans and the czech americans and the hungarian americans in this county that those country do not live under the domination and supervision of the soviet union behind the iron curtain

 we also have see mr. ford exclude himself from access to the public he have not have a tough cross examination type press conference in over 30 day one press conference he have without sound

 he be also show a weakness in yield to pressure the soviet union for instance put pressure on mr. ford and he refuse to see a symbol of human freedom recognize around the world alexander solzhenitsyn

 the arabs have put pressure on mr. ford and he be yield and he have permit a boycott by the arab country of american business who trade with israel who have american jews own or take part in the management of american company his own secretary of commerce have to be subpenae by the congress to reveal the name of business who be subject to this boycott they do not volunteer the information he have to be subpenae

 and the last thing i would like to say be this this grain deal with the soviet union in 72 be terrible and mr. ford make up for it with three embargo one against our own ally in japan that be not the way to run our foreign policy include international trade

 the moderator mr. trewhitt a question for governor carter

 mr trewhitt governor i would like to pick up on that point actually and on your appeal for a great measure of american idealism in foreign affair foreign affair come home to the american public pretty much in such issue as oil embargo and grain sale that sort of thing would you be willing to risk an oil embargo in order to promote human right in iran saudi arabia withhold arm from saudi arabia for the same purpose as a matter of fact i think you have perhaps answer this final part but would you withhold grain from the soviet union in order to promote civil right in the soviet union

 mr carter i would never single out food as a trade embargo item if i ever decide to impose an embargo because of a crisis in international relationship it would include all shipment of all equipment for instance if the arab country ever again declare an embargo against our nation on oil i would consider that not a military but an economic declaration of war and i would respond instantly and in kind i would not ship that arab country anything no weapon no spare part for weapon no oil drilling rig no oil pipe no nothing i would not single out just food

 another thing i would like to say be this in our international trade as i say in my opening statement we have become the arm merchant of the world when this republican administration come into office we be ship about $ 1 billion worth of arm overseas now $ 10 to $ 12 billion worth of arm overseas to country that quite often use these weapon to fight each other

 the shift in emphasis have be very disturbing to i speak about the middle east under the last democratic administration 60 percent of all weapon that go into the middle east be for israel nowadays--75 percent be for israel before now 60 percent go to the arab country and this do not include iran if you include iran our present shipment of weapon to the middle east only 20 percent go to israel this be a deviation from idealism it be a deviation from a commitment to our major ally in the middle east which be israel it be a yielding to economic pressure on the part of the arabs on the oil issue and it be also a tremendous indication that under the ford administration we have not address the energy policy adequately

 we still have no comprehensive energy policy in this country and it be an overall sign of weakness when we be weak at home economically high unemployment high inflation a confused government a wasteful defense establishment this encourage the kind of pressure that be be put on we successfully it would have be inconceivable 10 15 year ago for we to be bring to our knee with an arab oil embargo but it be do 3 year ago and they be still put pressure on we from the arab country to our discredit around the world

 these be the weakness that i see and i believe it be not just a matter of idealism it be a matter of be tough it be a matter of be strong it be a matter of be consistent our priority ought to be first of all to meet our own military need secondly to meet the need of our ally and friend and only then should we ship military equipment to foreign country as a matter of fact iran be go to get 80 f-14 's before we even meet our own air force order for f-14 's and the shipment of spruance class destroyers to iran be much more highly sophisticated than the spruance class destroyers that be presently be deliver to our own navy this be ridiculous and it ought to be change

 mr trewhitt governor let i pursue that if i may if i understand you correctly you would in fact to use my example withhold arm from iran and saudi arabia even if the risk be an oil embargo and if they should be secure those arm from somewhere else and then if the embargo come then you would respond in kind do i have it correctly

 mr carter if iran be not an arab country as you know it be a moslem country but if saudi arabia should declare an oil embargo against we then i would consider that an economic declaration of war and i would make sure that the saudis understand this ahead of time so there would be no doubt in their mind i think under those circumstance they would refrain from push we to our knee as they do in 1973 with the previous oil embargo

 the moderator president ford

 the president governor carter apparently do not realize that since i have be president we have sell to the israelis over $ 4 billion in military hardware we have make available to the israelis over 45 percent of the total economic and military aid since the establishment of israel 27 year ago so the ford administration have do a good job in help our good ally israel and we be dedicated to the survival and security of israel

 i believe that governor carter do not realize the need and necessity for arm sale to iran he indicate he would not make those iran be border very extensively by the soviet union iran have iraq as one of its neighbor the soviet union and the communist dominate government of iraq be neighbor of iran and iran be an ally of the united states it be my strong feeling that we ought to sell arm to iran for its own national security and as an ally a strong ally of the united states

 the history of our relationship with iran go back to the day of president truman when he decide that it be vitally necessary for our own security as well as that of iran that we should help that country and iran have be a good ally in 1973 when there be an oil embargo iran do not participate iran continue to sell oil to the united states i believe that it be in our interest and in the interest of israel and iran and saudi arabia for the united states to sell arm to those country it be for their security as well as ours

 the moderator mr. valeriani a question for president ford

 mr valeriani mr. president the policy of your administration be to normalize relation with mainland china that mean establish at some point full diplomatic relation and obviously do something about the mutual defense treaty with taiwan if you be elect will you move to establish full diplomatic relation with peking and will you abrogate the mutual defense treaty with taiwan and as a corollary would you provide mainland china with military equipment if the chinese be to ask for it

 the president our relationship with the people 's republic of china be base upon the shanghai communiqu f 1972 that communiqu all for the normalization of relation between the united states and the people 's republic it do not set a time schedule it do not make a determination as to how that relationship should be achieve in relationship to our current diplomatic recognition and obligation to the taiwanese government the shanghai communiqu ¤oe say that the difference between the people 's republic on the one hand and taiwan on the other shall be settle by peaceful mean

 the net result be this administration and during my time as the president for the next 4 year we will continue to move for normalization of relation in the traditional sense and we will insist that the dispute between taiwan and the people 's republic be settle peacefully as be agree in the shanghai communiqu f 1972

 the ford administration will not let down will not eliminate or forget our obligation to the people of taiwan we feel that there must be a continue obligation to the people the some 19 or 20 million people in taiwan and as we move during the next 4 year those will be the policy of this administration

 mr valeriani sir the military equipment for the mainland chinese

 the president there be no policy of this government to give to the people 's republic or to sell to the people 's republic of china military equipment i do not believe that we the united states should sell give or otherwise transfer military hardware to the people 's republic of china or any other communist nation such as the soviet union and the like

 the moderator governor carter

 mr carter i would like to go back just one moment to the previous question where mr. ford i think confuse the issue by try to say that we be ship israel 40 percent of our aid as a matter of fact during this current year we be ship iran or have contract to ship to iran about $ 7 billion worth of arm and also to saudi arabia about $ 7 billion worth of arm

 also in 1975 we almost bring israel to their knee after the yom kippur war by the so call reassessment of our relationship to israel we in effect try to make israel the scapegoat for the problem in the middle east and this weaken our relationship with israel a great deal and put a cloud on the total commitment that our people feel toward the israelis there ought to be a clear unequivocal commitment without change to israel

 in the far east i think we need to continue to be strong and i would certainly pursue the normalization of relationship with the people 's republic of china we open up a great opportunity in 1972 -which have pretty well be fritter away under mr. ford that ought to be a constant inclination toward friendship but i would never let that friendship with the people 's republic of china stand in the way of the preservation of the independence and freedom of the people on taiwan

 the moderator mr. frankel a question for governor carter

 mr frankel governor we always seem in our election and maybe in between too to argue about who can be tough in the world give or take a few billion dollar give or take one weapon system our lead politician and i think you two gentleman seem to settle roughly on the same strategy in the world at roughly the same pentagon budget cost

 how bad do thing have to get in our own economy or how much backwardness and hunger would it take in the world to persuade you that our national security and our survival require very drastic cutback in arm spending and dramatic new effort in other direction

 mr carter well always in the past we have have an ability to have a strong defense and also to have a strong domestic economy and also to be strong in our reputation and influence within the community of nation these characteristic of our country have be endanger under mr. ford we be no long respect in a showdown vote in the united nations or in any other international council we be lucky to get 20 percent of the other nation to vote with we our ally feel that we have neglect they the so call nixon shock against japan have weaken our relationship there under this administration we have also have an inclination to keep separate the european country think that if they be separate then we can dominate they and proceed with our secret lone ranger type diplomatic effort

 i would also like to point out that we in this country have let our economy go down the drain the bad inflation since the great depression the high unemployment of any developed nation of the world we have a high unemployment rate in this country than great britain than west germany our unemployment rate be twice as high as it be in italy it be three or four time as high as it be in japan and that terrible circumstance in this country be export overseas we comprise about 30 percent of the world 's economic trade power influence and when we be weak at home weak than all our ally that weakness weaken the whole free world so strong economy be very important

 another thing that we need to do be to reestablish the good relationship that we ought to have between the united states and our natural ally and friend they have feel neglect and use that base of strength and use the idealism the honesty the predictability the commitment the integrity of our own country that be where our strength lie and that would permit we to deal with the develop nation in a position of strength

 under this administration we have bad a continuation of a so call balance of power politic where everything be look on as a struggle between we on the one side and the soviet union on the other our ally the small country get trample in the rush

 what we need be to try to seek individualized bilateral relationship with country regardless of their size and to establish world order politic which mean we want to preserve peace through strength we also want to revert back to the stature and the respect that our country have in previous administration now i can not say when this can come but i can guarantee it will not come if gerald ford be reelect and this present policy be continue it will come if i be elect

 mr frankel if i hear you right sir you be say gun and butter both but president johnson also have trouble keep up both vietnam and his domestic program i be really ask when do the need of the city and our own need and those of other backward and even more needy country and society around the world take precedence over some of our military spending ever

 mr carter let i say very quickly that under president johnson in spite of the massive investment in the vietnam war he turn over a balanced budget to mr. nixon the unemployment rate be less than 4 percent the inflation rate under kennedy and johnson be about 2 percent out third what it be under this administration so we do have at that time with good management the ability to do both i do not think anybody can say that johnson and kennedy neglect the poor and the destitute people in this country or around the world

 but i can say this the number one responsibility of any president above all else be to guarantee the security of our nation an ability to be free of the threat of attack or blackmail and to carry out our obligation to our ally and friend and to carry out a legitimate foreign policy they must go hand in hand but the security of this nation have get to come first

 the moderator president ford

 the president let i say very categorically you can not maintain the security and the strength of the united states with the kind of defense budget cut that governor carter have indicate in 1975 he want to cut the budget $ 15 billion he be now down to a figure of $ 5 billion to $ 7 billion reduction of that kind will not permit the united states to be strong enough to deter aggression and maintain the peace

 governor carter apparently do not know the fact as soon as i become president i initiate meeting with the nato head of state and meet with they in brussels to discuss how we could improve the defense relationship in western europe in november of 1975 i meet with the leader of the five industrial nation in france for the purpose of see what we could do act together to meet the problem of the come recession in puerto rico this year i meet with six of the lead industrial nation head of state to meet the problem of inflation so we would be able to solve it before it get out of hand

 i have meet with the head of government bilaterally as well as multilaterally our relation with japan have never be well i be the first united states president to visit japan and we have the emperor of japan here this past year and the net result be japan and the united states be work more closely together now than at any time in the history of our relationship you can go around the world and let i take israel for example just recently president prime minister rabin say that our relation be never well

 the moderator mr. trewhitt a question for president ford

 mr trewhitt mr. president you refer early to your meeting with mr. brezhnev at vladivostok in 1974 you agree on that occasion to try to achieve another strategic arm limitation salt agreement within the year nothing happen in 1975 or not very much publicly at least and those talk be still drag and thing get quieter as the current season approach be there a bit of politic involve there perhaps on both side or perhaps more important be interim weapon development and i be think of such thing as the cruise missile and the soviet ss-20 intermediate range rocket make salt irrelevant bypass the salt negotiation

 the president first we have to understand that salt i expire october 3 1977 mr. brezhnev and i meet in vladivostok in december of 1974 for the purpose of try to take the initial step so we could have a salt ii agreement that would go to 1985 as i indicate early we do agree on a 2,400 limitation on launcher of ballistic missile that would mean a cutback in the soviet program it would not interfere with our .own program at the same time we put a limitation of 1,320 on mirv 's

 our technician have be work since that time in geneva try to put into technical language an agreement that can be verify by both party in the meantime there have develop the problem of the soviet backfire their high performance aircraft which they say be not a long range aircraft and which some of our people say be an intercontinental aircraft in the interim there have be the development on our part primarily the cruise missile cruise missile that could be launch from land base mobile installation cruise missile that could be launch from high performance aircraft like the b-52 's or the b l 's which i hope we proceed with cruise missile which could be launch from either surface or submarine naval vessel those gray area weapon system be create some problem in the agreement for a salt ii negotiation

 but i can say that i be dedicate to proceed and i meet just last week with the foreign minister of the soviet union and he indicate to i that the soviet union be interested in narrow the difference and make a realistic and a sound compromise

 i hope and trust in the good interest of both country and in the good interest of all people throughout this globe that the soviet union and the united states can make a mutually beneficial agreement because if we do not and salt i expire on october 3 1977 you will unleash again an all out nuclear arm race with the potential of a nuclear holocaust of unbelievable dimension so it be the obligation of the president to do just that and i intend to do so

 mr trewhitt mr. president let i follow that up i will submit that the cruise missile add a whole new dimension to the arm competition and then cite a statement by your office to the arm control association a few day ago in which you say that the cruise missile might eventually be include in a comprehensive arm limitation agreement but that in the meantime it be an essential part of the american strategic arsenal now may i assume from that that you be tend to exclude the cruise missile from the next salt agreement or be it still negotiable in that context

 the president i believe that the cruise missile which we be now develop in research and development across the spectrum from air from the sea or from the land can be include within a salt ii agreement they be a new weapon system that have a great potential both conventional and nuclear armed at the same time we have to make certain that the soviet union 's backfire which they claim be not an intercontinental aircraft and which some of our people contend be must also be include if we be to get the kind of an agreement which be in the good interest of both country

 and i really believe that it be far well for we and for the soviet union and more importantly for the people around the world that these two super power find an answer for a salt ii agreement before october 3 1977 i think good will on both part hard bargaining by both party and a reasonable compromise will be in the good interest of all party

 the moderator governor carter

 mr carter well mr. ford act like he be run for president for the first time he have be in office 2 year and there have be absolutely no progress make toward a new salt agreement he have learn the date of the expiration of salt i apparently

 we have see in this world a development of a tremendous threat to we as a nuclear engineer myself i know the limitation and capability of atomic power i also know that as far as the human being on this earth be concern that the nonproliferation of atomic weapon be number one only in the last few day with the election approach have mr. ford take any interest in a nonproliferation movement

 i advocate last may in a speech at the united nations that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear device both weapon and peaceful device that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuse to comply with strict control over the waste which can be reprocess into explosive i have also advocate that we stop the sale by germany and france of reprocess plant to pakistan and brazil mr. ford have not move on this we also need to provide an adequate supply of enriched uranium mr. ford again under pressure from the atomic energy lobby have insist that this reprocessing or rather reenrichment be do by private industry and not by the exist government plant

 this kind of confusion and absence of leadership have let we drift now for 2 year with the constantly increase threat of atomic weapon throughout the world we now have five nation that have atomic bomb that we know about if we continue under mr. ford 's policy by 1985 or 90 we will have 20 nation that have the capability of explode atomic weapon this have get to be stop that be one of the major challenge and major undertaking that i will assume as the next president

 the moderator mr. valeriani a question for governor carter

 mr valeriani governor carter early tonight you say america be not strong anymore america be not respect anymore and i feel i must ask you do you really believe that the united states be not the strong country in the world do you really believe that the united states be not the most respected country in the world or be that just campaign rhetoric

 mr carter no it be not just campaign rhetoric i think that militarily we be as strong as any nation on earth i think we have get to stay that way and continue to increase our capability to meet any potential threat but as far as strength derive from commitment to principle as far as strength derive from the unity within our country as far as strength derive from the people the congress the secretary of state the president share in the evolution and carry out of a foreign policy as far as strength derive from the respect of our own ally and friend their assurance that we will be staunch in our commitment that we will not deviate and we will give they adequate attention as far as strength derive from do what be right care for the poor provide food become the breadbasket of the world instead of the arm merchant of the world in those respect we be not strong also we will never be strong again overseas unless we be strong at home and with our economy in such terrible disarray and get bad by the month we have get 500,000 more americans unemployed today than we have 3 month ago we have get 2 1/2 million more americans out of work now than we have when mr. ford take office this kind of deterioration in our economic strength be bind to weaken we around the world

 and we not only have problem at home but we export those problem overseas so as far as the respect of our own people toward our own government as far as participation in the shaping of concept and commitment as far as a trust of our country among the nation of the world as far as dependence of our country in meet the need and obligation that we have express to our ally as far as the respect of our country even among our potential adversary we be weak potentially we be strong under this administration that strength have not be realize

 the moderator president ford

 the president governor carter brag about the unemployment during democratic administration and condemn the unemployment at the present time i must remind he that we be at peace and during the period that he brag about unemployment be low the united states be at war

 now let i correct one other comment that governor carter have make i have recommend to the congress that we develop the uranium enrichment plant at portsmouth ohio which be a publicly own us government facility and have indicate that the private program which would follow on in alabama be one that may or may not be construct but i commit to the one at portsmouth ohio

 the governor also talk about morality in foreign policy the foreign policy of the united states meet the high standard of morality what be more moral than peace and the united states be at peace today what be more moral in foreign policy than for the administration to take the lead in the world food conference in rome in 1974 when the united states commit 6 million metric ton of food over 60 percent of the food commit for the disadvantaged and underdeveloped nation of the world the ford administration want to eradicate hunger and disease in our underdeveloped country throughout the world what be more moral than for the united states under the ford administration to take the lead in southern africa in the middle east those be initiative in foreign policy which be of the high moral standard and that be indicative of the foreign policy of this country

 the moderator mr. frankel a question for president ford

 mr frankel mr. president can we stick with morality for a lot of people it seem to cover a bunch of sin

 mr. nixon and mr. kissinger use to tell we that instead of morality we have to worry in the world about live with and let live all kind of government that we really do not like north and south korean dictator chilean fascist chinese communists iranian emperor and so on they say the only way to get by in a wicked world be to treat other on the basis of how they treat we and not how they treat their own people

 but more recently we seem to have take a different tack we seem to have decide that it be part of our business to tell the rhodesians for instance that the way they be treat their own black people be wrong and they have get to change their government and we put pressure on they we be rather liberal in our advice to the italians as to how to vote

 be this a new ford foreign policy in the making can we expect that you be now go to turn to south africa and force they to change their government to intervene in similar way to end the bloodshed as you call it say in chile or chilean prison and to throw our weight around for the value that we hold dear in the world

 the president i believe that our foreign policy must express the high standard of morality and the initiative that we take in southern africa be the good example of what this administration be do and will continue to do in the next 4 year

 if the united states have not move when we do in southern africa there be no doubt there would have be an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world if we have not take our initiative it be very very possible that the government of rhodesia would have be overrun and that the soviet union and the cubans would have dominate southern africa

 so the united states seek to preserve the principle of self determination to eliminate the possibility of bloodshed to protect the right of the minority as we insist upon the right of the majority i believe follow the good conscience of the american people in foreign policy and i believe that we have use our skill secretary of state kissinger have do a superb job in work with the black african nation the so call frontline nation he have do a superb job in get the prime minister of south africa mr. vorster to agree that the time have come for a solution to the problem of rhodesia secretary kissinger in his meeting with prime minister smith of rhodesia be able to convince he that it be in the good interest of white as well as black in rhodesia to find an answer for a transitional government and then a majority government

 this be a perfect example of the kind of leadership that the united states under this administration have take and i can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future effort in foreign policy include our effort in the middle east where it be vitally important because the middle east be the crossroad of the world there have be more dispute and it be an area where there be more volatility than any other place in the world but because arab nation and the israelis trust the united states we be able to take the lead in the sinai ii agreement

 and i can assure you that the united states will have the leadership role in move toward a comprehensive settlement of the middle eastern problem i hope and trust as soon as possible and we will do it with the high moral principle

 ms. frankel mr. president just clarify one point there be lot of majority in the world that feel they be be push around by minority government and be you say they can now expect to look to we for not just good cheer but throw our weight on their side in south africa or on taiwan or in chile to help change their government as in rhodesia

 the president i would hope that as we move to one area of the world from another and the united states must not spread itself too thinly that be one of the problem that help to create the circumstance in vietnam but as we as a nation find that we be ask by the various party either one nation against another or individual within a nation that the united states will take the leadership and try to resolve the difference

 let i take south korea as an example i have personally tell president park that the united states do not condone the kind of repressive measure that he have take in that country but i think in all fairness and equity we have to recognize the problem that south korea have on the north they have north korea with 500,000 well train well equip troop they be support by the people 's republic of china they be support by the soviet union south korea face a very delicate situation now the united states in this case this administration have recommend a year ago and we have reiterate it again this year that the united states south korea north korea and the people 's republic of china sit down at a conference table to resolve the problem of the korean peninsula this be a leadership role that the united states under this administration be carry out and if we do it and i think the opportunity and the possibility be get well we will have solve many of the internal domestic problem that exist in south korea at the present time

 the moderator governor carter

 mr carter i notice that mr. ford do not comment on the prison in chile this be a typical example maybe of many other where this administration overthrow an elect government and help to establish a military dictatorship this have not be an ancient history story last year under mr. ford of all the food for peace that go to south america 85 percent go to the military dictatorship in chile

 another point i want to make be this he say we have to move from one area of the world to another that be one of the problem with this administration 's so call shuttle diplomacy while the secretary of state be in one country there be almost 150 other that be wonder what we be go to do next what will be the next secret agreement we do not have a comprehensive understandable foreign policy that deal with world problem or even regional problem

 another thing that concern i be what mr. ford say about unemployment that insinuate that under johnson and kennedy that unemployment could only be hold down when this country be at war karl marx say that the free enterprise system in a democracy can only continue to exist when they be at war or prepare for war karl marx be the grandfather of communism i do not agree with that statement i hope mr. ford do not either

 he have put pressure on the congress and i do not believe mr. ford would even deny this to hold up on nonproliferation legislation until the congress agree for an $ 8 billion program for private industry to start produce enriched uranium

 and the last thing i want to make be this he talk about peace and i be thankful for peace we be peaceful when mr. ford go into office but he and mr. kissinger and other try to start a new vietnam in angola and it be only the outcry of the american people and the congress when this secret deal be discover that prevent our renew involvement in that conflagration which be take place there

 the moderator gentleman i be sorry to say we do not have time enough for two complete sequence of question we now have only 12 minute leave therefore i would like to ask for short question and short answer and we also will drop the follow up question each candidate may still respond of course to the other 's answer mr. trewhitt a question for governor carter

 mr trewhitt governor carter before this event the most communication i receive concerned panama would you as president be prepared to sign a treaty which at a fix date yield administrative and economic control of the canal zone and share defense which as i understand it be the position the united states take in 1974

 mr carter well here again the panamanian question be one that have be confuse by mr. ford he have direct his diplomatic representative to yield to the panamanians full sovereignty over the panama canal zone at the end of a certain period of time when mr. reagan raise this question in florida mr. ford not only disavow his instruction but he also even drop parenthetically the use of the word detente

 i would never give up complete control or practical control of the panama canal zone but i would continue to negotiate with the panamanians when the original treaty be sign back in the early 1900 's when theodore roosevelt be president panama retain sovereignty over the panama canal zone we retain control as though we have sovereignty

 now i would be willing to go ahead with negotiation i believe that we could share more fully responsibility for the panama canal zone with panama i would be willing to continue to raise the payment for shipment of good through the panama canal zone i might even be willing to reduce to some degree our military emplacement in the panama canal zone but i would not relinquish practical control of the panama canal zone any time in the foreseeable future

 the moderator president ford

 the president the united states must and will maintain complete access to the panama canal the united states must maintain a defense capability of the panama canal and the united states will maintain our national security interest in the panama canal

 the negotiation for the panama canal start under president johnson and have continue up to the present time i believe those negotiation should continue but there be certain guideline that must be follow and i have just define they

 let i take just a minute to comment on something that governor carter say on nonproliferation in may of 1975 i call for a conference of nuclear supplier that conference have meet six time in may of this year governor carter take the first initiative approximately 12 month after i have take my initiative a year ago

 the moderator mr. valeriani a question for president ford

 mr valeriani mr. president the government general accounting office have just put out a report suggest that you shoot from the hip in the mayaguez rescue mission and that you ignore diplomatic message say that a peaceful solution be in prospect why do not you do more diplomatically at the time and a related question do the white i house try to prevent the release of that report

 the president the white house do not prevent the release of that report on july 12 of this year we give full permission for the release of that report i be very disappointed in the fact that the gao release that report because i think it interject political partisan politic at the present time

 but let i comment on the report somebody who sit in washington d.c. 18 month after the mayaguez incident can be a very good grandstand quarterback and let i make another observation this morning i get a call from the skipper of the mayaguez he be furious because he tell i that it be the action of i president ford that save the life of the crew of the mayaguez and i can assure you that if we have not take the strong and forceful action that we do we would have be criticize very very severely for sit back and not move

 captain miller be thankful the crew be thankful we do the right thing it seem to i that those who sit in washington 18 month after the incident be not the good judge of the decisionmaking process that have to be make by the national security council and by myself at the time the incident be develop in the pacific

 let i assure you that we make every possible overture to the people 's republic of china and through they to the cambodian government we make diplomatic protest to the cambodian government through the united nations every possible diplomatic mean be utilize but at the same time i have a responsibility and so do the national security council to meet the problem at hand and we handle it responsibly and i think captain miller 's testimony to that effect be the good evidence

 the moderator governor carter

 mr carter well i be reluctant to comment on the recent report i have not read it i think the american people have only one requirement that the fact about mayaguez be give to they accurately and completely

 mr. ford have be there for 18 month he have the fact that be release today immediately after the mayaguez incident i understand that the report today be accurate mr. ford have say i believe that it be accurate and that the white house make no attempt to block the issuing of that report i do not know if that be exactly accurate or not

 i understand that both the department of state and the defense department have approve the accuracy of today 's report or yesterday 's report and also the national security agency i do not know what be right or what be wrong or what be do the only thing i believe be that whatever the knowledge be that mr. ford have should have be give to the american people 18 month ago immediately after the mayaguez incident occur

 this be what the american people want when something happen that endanger our security or when something happen that threaten our stature in the world or when american people be endanger by the action of a foreign country just 40 sailor on the mayaguez we obviously have to move aggressively and quickly to rescue they but then after the immediate action be take i believe the president have an obligation to tell the american people the truth and not wait 18 month later for the report to be issue

 the moderator gentleman at this time we have time for only two very short question mr. frankel a question for governor carter

 mr frankel governor carter if the price of gain influence among the arabs be close our eye a little bit to their boycott against israel how would you handle that

 mr carter i believe that the boycott of american business by the arab country because those business trade with israel or because they have american jews who be owner or director in the company be an absolute disgrace this be the first time that i remember in the history of our country when we have let a foreign country circumvent or change our bill of rights i will do everything i can as president to stop the boycott of american business by the arab country

 it be not a matter of diplomacy or trade with i it be a matter of morality and i do not believe that the arab country will pursue it when we have a strong president who will protect the integrity of our country the commitment of our constitution and bill of rights and protect people in this country who happen to be jews it may later be catholics it may later be baptist who be threaten by some foreign country but we ought to stand staunch and i think it be a disgrace that so far mr. ford 's administration have block the passage of legislation that would have reveal by law every instance of the boycott and it would have prevent the boycott from continue

 the moderator president ford

 the president again governor carter be inaccurate the arab boycott action be first take in 1952 and in november of 1975 i be the first president to order the executive branch to take action affirmative action through the department of commerce and other cabinet departments to make certain that no american businessman or business organization should discriminate against jews because of an arab boycott

 and i might add that my administration and i be very proud of it be the first administration that have take an antitrust action against company in this country that have allegedly cooperate with the arab boycott just on monday of this week i sign a tax bill that include an amendment that would prevent company in the united states from take a tax deduction if they have in any way whatsoever cooperate with the arab boycott

 and last week when we be try to get the export administration act through the congress necessary legislation my administration go to capitol hill and try to convince the house and the senate that we should have an amendment on that legislation which would take strong and effective action against those who participate or cooperate with the arab boycott

 one other point because the congress fail to act i be go to announce tomorrow that the department of commerce will disclose those company that have participate in the arab boycott this be something that we can do the congress fail to do it and we intend to do it

 the moderator mr. trewhitt a very brief question for president ford

 mr trewhitt mr. president if you get the accounting of miss in action you want from north vietnam or from vietnam i be sorry now would you then be prepared to reopen negotiation for restoration of relation with that country

 the president let i restate our policy as long as vietnam north vietnam do not give we a full and complete accounting of our miss in action i will never go along with the admission of vietnam to the united nations if they do give we a bona fide complete accounting of the 800 mia 's then i believe that the united states should begin negotiation for the admission of vietnam to the united nations but not until they have give we the full accounting of our mia 's

 the moderator governor carter

 mr carter one of the most embarrassing failure of the ford administration and one that touch specifically on human right be his refusal to appoint a presidential commission to go to vietnam to go to laos to go to cambodia and try to trade for the release of information about those who be miss in action in those war this be what the family of mia 's want so far mr. ford have not do it we have have several fragmentary effort by member of the congress and by private citizen

 several month ago the vietnam government say we be ready to sit down and negotiate for release of information on mia 's so far mr. ford have not respond

 i also would never formalize relationship with vietnam nor permit they to join the united nations until they have take this action but that be not enough we need to have an active and aggressive action on the part of the president the leader of this country to seek out every possible way to get that information which have keep the mia family in despair and doubt and mr. ford have just not do it

 the moderator thank you governor carter

 that complete the questioning for this evening each candidate now have up to 3 minute for a closing statement it be determine by the toss of a coin that governor carter would take the first question and he now go first with his closing remark

 president ford and governor carter do not have prepare note or comment with they this evening but they may make note and refer to they during the debate

 it have be determine that president ford would take the first question in this last debate and mr. kraft you have that first question for president ford

 mr kraft mr. president i assume that the americans all know that these be difficult time and that there be no pie in the sky and that they do not expect something for nothing so i would like to ask you as a first question as you look ahead in the next 4 year what sacrifice be you go to call on the american people to make what price be you go to ask they to pay to realize your objective

 let i add governor carter that if you feel that it be appropriate to answer that question in your comment as to what price it would be appropriate for the american people to pay for a carter administration i think that would be proper too mr. president

 the president mr. kraft i believe that the american people in the next 4 year under a ford administration will be call upon to make those necessary sacrifice to preserve the peace which we have which mean of course that we will have to maintain an adequate military capability which mean of course that we will have to add i think a few billion dollar to our defense appropriation to make certain that we have adequate strategic force adequate conventional force

 i think the american people will be call upon to be in the forefront in give leadership to the solution of those problem that must be solve in the middle east in southern africa and any problem that might arise in the pacific

 the american people will be call upon to tighten their belt a bit in meet some of the problem that we face domestically i do not think that america can go on a big spending spree with a whole lot of new program that would add significantly to the federal budget

 i believe that the american people if give the leadership that i would expect to give would be willing to give this thrust to preserve the peace and the necessary restraint at home to hold the lid on spend so that we could i think have a long overdue and totally justify tax decrease for the middle income people and then with the economy that would be generate from a restraint on spending and a tax reduction primarily for the middle income people then i think the american people would be willing to make those sacrifice for peace and prosperity in the next 4 year

 mr kraft could i be a little bit more specific mr. president

 the president sure sure

 mr kraft do not your policy really imply that we be go to have to have a pretty high rate of unemployment over a fairly long time that growth be go to be fairly slow and that we be not go to be able to do very much in the next 4 or 5 year to meet the basic agenda of our national need in the city in health in transit and a whole lot of other thing like that

 the president not at all

 mr kraft be not those the real cost

 the president no mr. kraft we be spend very significant amount of money now some $ 200 billion a year almost 50 percent of our total federal expenditure by the federal government at the present time for human need now we will probably have to increase that to some extent but we do not have to have growth in spending that will blow the lid off and add to the problem of inflation

 i believe we can meet the problem within the city of this country and still give a tax reduction i propose as you know a reduction to increase the personal exemption from $ 750 to $ 1,000 with the fiscal program that i have and if you look at the projection it show that we will reduce unemployment that we will continue to win the battle against inflation and at the same time give the kind of quality of life that i believe be possible in america a job a home for all those that will work and save for it safety in the street health care that be affordable these thing can be do if we have the right vision and the right restraint and the right leadership

 the moderator thank you governor carter your response please

 mr carter well i might say first of all that i think in case of a carter administration the sacrifice would be much less mr. ford 's own environmental agency have project a 10 percent unemployment rate by 1978 if be be president the american people be ready to make sacrifice if they be part of the process if they know that they will be help to make decision and will not be exclude from be an involved party to the national purpose

 the major effort that we must put forward be to put our people back to work and i think that this be one example where a lot of people have selfish grasp idea now i remember in 1973 in the depth of the energy crisis when president nixon call on the american people to make a sacrifice to cut down on the waste of gasoline to cut down on the speed of automobile it be a tremendous surge of patriotism i want to make a sacrifice for my country

 i think we could call together with strong leadership in the white house business industry and labor and say let us have voluntary price restraint let us lay down some guideline so we do not have continue inflation

 we could also have an end to the extreme we now have one extreme for instance of some welfare recipient who by take advantage of the welfare law the housing law the medicaid law and the food stamp law make over $ 10,000 a year and they do not have to pay any taxis on it at the other extreme just i percent of the rich people in our country derive 25 percent of all the tax benefit so both those extreme grasp for advantage and the person who have to pay that expense be the middle income family who be still work for a living and they have to pay for the rich who have the privilege and for the poor who be not work

 but i think that a balanced approach with everybody be part of it and strive for unselfishness could help as it do in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country i know i be ready for it i think the american people be too

 the moderator thank you mr. maynard your question to governor carter

 mr maynard governor by all indication the voter be so turn off by this election campaign so far that only half intend to vote one major reason for this apathetic electorate appear to be the low level at which this campaign bas be conduct it have digress frequently from important issue into allegation of blunder and brainwash and fixation on lust in playboy what responsibility do you accept for the low level of this campaign for the nation 's high office

 mr carter i think the major reason for a decrease in participation that we have experience ever since 1960 bas be the deep discouragement of the american people about the performance of public official when you have get 7 1/2 8 million people out of work when you have get three time as much inflation as you have during the last 8 year democratic administration when you have the high deficit in history when you have it become increasingly difficult for a family to put a child through college or to own a home there be a natural inclination to be turn off also in the aftermath of vietnam and cambodia and watergate and the cia revelation people have feel that they have be betray by public official

 i have to admit that in the heat of the campaign i've be in 30 primary during the springtime i have be campaign for 22 month i've make some mistake and i think this be part of just be a human being i have to say that my campaign have be an open one the playboy thing bas be of very great concern to i i do not know how to deal with it exactly i agree to give the interview to playboy other people have do it who be notable governor jerry brown walter cronkite albert schweitzer mr. ford 's own secretary of treasury mr. simon william buckley many other people but they be not run for president and in retrospect from hindsight i would not have give that interview have i to do it over again if i should ever decide in the future to discuss my deep christian belief and condemnation and sinfulness l would use another forum besides playboy

 but i can say this i be do the good i can to get away from that and during the next 10 day the american people will not see the carter campaign run television advertisement or newspaper advertisement base on a personal attack on president ford 's character i believe that the opposite be true with president ford 's campaign and i hope that we can leave those issue in the next 10 day about personality and mistake of the past we've both matte some mistake and talk about unemployment inflation housing education taxation government organization strip away of secrecy and the thing that be crucial to the american people

 i regret the thing in my own long campaign that have be mistake but i be try to do away with those the last 10 day

 the moderator thank you governor carter president ford your response

 the president i believe that the american people have be turn off in this election mr. maynard for a variety of reason we have see on capitol hill in the congress a great many allegation of wrongdoing of alleged immorality those be very disturbing to the american people they wonder how an elect representative can serve they and participate in such activity serve in the congress of the united states yes and i be certain many many americans be turn off by the revelation of watergate a very very bad period of time in american political history yes and thousand maybe million of americans be turn off because of the problem that come out of our involvement in vietnam

 but on the other hand i find on july 4 of this year a new spirit bear in america we be celebrate our bicentennial and i find that there be a movement as i travel around the country of great interest in this campaign now like any hard work person seek public office in the campaign inevitably sometimes you will use rather graphic language and i be guilty of that just like i think most other in the political arena but i do make a pledge that in the next 10 day when we be ask the american people to make one of the most important decision in their lifetime because i think this election be one of the most vital in the history of america that we do together what we can to stimulate voter participation

 the moderator thank you president ford mr. nelson your question to president ford

 mr nelson mr. president you mention watergate and you become president because of watergate so do not you owe the american people a special obligation to explain in detail your role of limit one of the original investigation of a watergate that be the one by the house banking committee and i know you have answer question on this before but there be question that still remain and i think people want to know what your role be

 will you name the person you talk to in connection with that investigation and since you say you have no recollection of talk to anyone from the white house would you be willing to open for examination the white house tape of conversation during that period

 the president mr. nelson i testify before two committee house and senate on precisely the question that you have ask and the testimony under oath be to the effect that i do not talk to mr. nixon to mr. haldeman to mr. ehrlichman or to any of the people at the white house i say i have no recollection whatsoever of talk with any of the white house legislative liaison people

 i indicate under oath that the initiative that i take be at the request of the rank member of the house banking and currency committee on the republican side which be a legitimate request and a proper response by i

 now that be go into by two congressional committee and follow that investigation both committee overwhelmingly approve i and both the house and the senate do likewise

 now in the meantime the special prosecutor within the last few day after an investigation himself say there be no reason for he to get involve because he find nothing that would justify it and then just a day or two ago the attorney general of the united states make a further investigation and come to precisely the same conclusion

 now after all of those investigation by objective responsible people i think the matter be close once and for all but to add one other feature i do not control any of the tape those tape be in the jurisdiction of the court and i have no right to say yes or no but all the committee the attorney general the special prosecutor all of they have give i a clean bill of health i think the matter be settle once and for all

 mr nelson well mr. president if i do say so though the question be that i think you still have not go into detail about what your role in it be and i do not think there be any question about whether or not there be a criminal prosecution but whether you have tell the american people your entire involvement in it and whether you would be willing even though you do not control the tape whether you would be willing to ask that the tape be release for examination

 the president that be for the proper authority who have control over those tape to make that decision i have give every bit of evidence answer every question that be be ask i by any senator or any member of the house plus the fact that the special prosecutor on his own initiation and the attorney general on his initiation the high law enforcement official in this country all of they have give i a clean bill of health and i have tell everything i know about it i think the matter be settle once and for all

 the moderator governor carter your response

 mr carter i do not have any response

 the moderator thank you

 then we will have the next question from mr. kraft to governor carter

 mr kraft governor carter the next big crisis spot in the world may be yugoslavia president tito be old and sick and there be division in his country it be pretty certain that the russians be go to do everything they possibly can after tito die to force yugoslavia back into the soviet camp

 but last saturday you say and this be a quote--"i would not go to war in yugoslavia even if the soviet union send in troop do not that statement practically invite the russians to intervene in yugoslavia do not it discourage yugoslavs who might be tempt to resist and would not it have be wise on your part to say nothing and to keep the russians in the dark as president ford do and as i think every president have do since president truman

 mr carter in the last 2 week i have have a chance to talk to two man who have visit the soviet union yugoslavia and china one be governor averell harriman,1 who visit the soviet union and yugoslavia and the other one be james schlesinger,2 whom i think you accompany to china i get a complete report back from those country from these two distinguished gentleman

 1 governor of new york 1954 58 and ambassador at large 1961 1965 68

 2secretary of defense 1973 75

 mr. harriman talk to the leader in yugoslavia and i think it be accurate to say that there be no prospect in their opinion of the soviet union invade yugoslavia should mr. tito pass away the present leadership there be fairly uniform in their purpose i think it be a close knit group and i think it would be unwise for we to say that we will go to war in yugoslavia if the soviets should invade which i think would be an extremely unlikely thing

 i have maintain from the very beginning of my campaign and this be a standard answer that i make in response to the yugoslavian question that i would never go to war become militarily involved in the internal affair of another country unless our own security be directly threaten and i do not believe that our security would be directly threaten if the soviet union go into yugoslavia i do not believe it will happen i certainly hope it will not i would take the strong possible measure short of actual military action there by our own troop but i doubt that that would be an eventuality

 mr kraft one quick follow up do you clear the response you make with secretary schlesinger and governor harriman

 mr carter no i do not

 the moderator president ford your response

 the president well i firmly believe mr. kraft that it be unwise for a president to signal in advance what option he might exercise if any international problem arise

 i think we all recall with some sadness that at the period of the late 1940 's early 1950 's there be some indication that the united states would not include south korea in an area of defense there be some who allege i can not prove it true or untrue that such a statement in effect invite the north koreans to invade south korea it be a fact they do

 but no president of the united states in my opinion should signal in advance to a prospective enemy what his decision might be or what option he might exercise it be far well for a person sit in the white house who have a number of option to make certain that the other side so to speak do not know precisely what you be go to do and therefore that be the reason that i would not identify any particular course of action when i respond to a question a week or so ago

 the moderator thank you

 mr. maynard your question to president ford please

 mr maynard sir this question concern your administrative performance as president the other day general george brown the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff deliver his view on several sensitive subject among they great britain one of this country 's old ally he say and i quote he now great britain it be a pathetic thing it just make you cry they be no long a world power all they have be general admiral and band since general brown 's comment have cause this country embarrassment in the past why be he still this nation 's lead military officer

 the president i have indicate to general brown that the word that he use in that interview in that particular case and in several other be very ill advise and general brown have indicate his apology his regret and i think that will in this situation settle the matter

 it be tragic that the full transcript of that interview be not release and that there be excerpt some of the excerpt take out of context not this one however that you bring up

 general brown have an exemplary record of military performance he serve this nation with great great skill and courage and bravery for 35 year and i think it be the consensus of the people who be knowledgeable in the military field that he be probably the outstanding military leader and strategist that we have in america today

 now he do use ill advise word but i think in the fact that he apologize that he be reprimand do permit he to stay on and continue that kind of leadership that we so badly need as we enter into negotiation under the salt ii agreement or if we have operation that might be develop in the middle east or in southern africa or in the pacific we need a man with that experience that knowledge that know how and i think in light of the fact that he have apologize would not have justify my asking for his resignation

 the moderator thank you

 governor carter your response

 mr carter well just briefly i think this be the second time that general brown have make a statement for which he do have to apologize and i know that everybody make mistake i think the first one be relate to the unwarranted influence of american jews on the medium and in the congress this one concern great britain i think he say israel be a military burden on we and that iran hope to reestablish the persian empire

 i be not sure that i remember early that president ford have express his concern about the statement or apologize for it this be something though that i think be indicative of a need among the american people to know how the commander in chief the president feel and i think the only criticism that i would have of mr. ford be that immediately when the statement be reveal perhaps a statement from the president would have be a clarifying and a very beneficial thing

 the moderator mr. nelson your question now to governor carter

 mr nelson governor despite the fact that you have be run for president a long time now many americans still seem to be uneasy about you they do not feel that they know you or the people around you and one problem seem to be that you have not reach out to bring people with broad background or national experience into your campaign or your presidential plan most of the people around you on a day to day basis be the people you have know in georgia many of they be young and relatively inexperienced in national affair do not this raise a serious question as to whether you would bring into a carter administration people with the necessary background to run the federal government

 mr carter i do not believe it do i begin campaign 22 month ago at that time nobody think i have a chance to win very few people know who i be i come from a tiny town as you know plains and do not hold public office do not have very much money and my first organization be just four or five people plus my wife and my child my three son and their wife

 and we win the nomination by go out into the street barbershop beauty parlor restaurant store in factory shift line also in farmer market and livestock sale barn and we talk a lot and we listen a lot and we learn from the american people we build up an awareness among the voter of this country particularly those in whose primary i entered--30 of they nobody have ever do that before about who i be and what i stand for

 now we have a very wide range group of adviser who help i prepare for these debate and who teach i about international economic and foreign affair defense matter health education welfare government reorganization i'd say several hundred of they and they be very fine and very highly qualified

 the one major decision that i have make since acquire the nomination and i share this with president ford be the choice of the vice president i think this would be indicative of the kind of leader that i would choose to help i if i be elect

 i choose senator walter mondale and the only criterion that i have put forward in my own mind be who among the several million people in this country would be the good person qualified to be president if something should happen to i and to join i in be vice president if i should serve out my term and i be convince now more than i be when i get the nomination that walter mondale be the right choice and i believe this be a good indication of the kind of people that i would choose in the future

 mr. ford have have that same choice to make i do not want to say anything critical of senator dole but i have never hear mr. ford say that that be his primary consideration who be the good person i could choose in this country to be president of the united states

 i feel completely at ease know that some day senator mondale might very well be president in the last five vice presidential nominee incumbent three of they have become president but i think this be indicative of what i would do

 the moderator president ford your response please

 the president the governor may not have hear my establish criterion for the selection of a vice president but it be a well establish criterion that the person i select would be fully qualified to be president of the united states and senator bob dole be so qualified--16 year in the house of representatives and in the senate very high responsibility on important committee

 i do not mean to be critical of senator mondale but i be very very surprised when i read that senator mondale make a very derogatory very personal comment about general brown after the news story that break about general brown if my recollection be correct he indicate that general brown be not qualified to be a sewer commissioner i do not think that be a proper way to describe a chairman of the joint chiefs of staff who have fight for his country for 35 year and i be sure the governor would agree with i on that i think senator dole would show more good judgment and discretion than to so describe a heroic and brave and very outstanding leader of the military

 so i think our selection of bob dole as vice president be base on merit and if he should ever become the president of the united states with his vast experience as a member of the house and a member of the senate as well as a vice president i think he would do an outstanding job as president of the united states

 the moderator mr. kraft your question to president ford

 mr kraft mr. president let i assure you and maybe some of the view audience that be on this panel have not be as it may seem all torture and agony one of the hearten thing be that i and my colleague have receive literally hundred and maybe even thousand of suggest question from ordinary citizen all across the country who want answer

 the president that be a tribute to their interest in this election

 mr kraft i will give you that but let i go on because one main subject on the mind of all of they have be the environment particularly curious about your record people really want to know why you veto the strip mining bill they want to know why you work against strong control on auto emission they want to know why you be not do anything about pollution of the atlantic ocean they want to know why a bipartisan organization such as the national league of conservation voters say that when it come to environmental issue you be and i be quoting--"hopeless

 the president first let i set the record straight i veto the strip mining bill mr. kraft because it be the overwhelming consensus of knowledgeable people that that strip mining bill would have mean the loss of literally thousand of job something around 140,000 job number two that strip mining bill would have severely set back our need for more coal and governor carter have say repeatedly that coal be the resource that we need to use more in the effort to become independent of the arab oil supply so i veto it because of a loss of job and because it would have interfere with our energy independence program

 the auto emission it be agree by leonard woodcock the head of the uaw and by the head of all of the automobile industry we have labor and management together say that those auto emission standard have to be modify

 but let us talk about what the ford administration have do in the field of environment i have increase as president by over 60 percent the funding for water treatment plant in the united states the federal contribution i have fully fund the land and water conservation program in fact have recommend and the congress approve a substantially increase land and water conservation program

 i have add in the current year budget the fund for the national park service for example we propose about $ 12 million to add between 400 and 500 more employee for the national park service

 and a month or so ago i do likewise say over the next 10 year we should expand double the national park the wilderness area the scenic river area and then of course the final thing be that i have sign and approve of more scenic river more wilderness area since i have be president than any other president in the history of the united states

 the moderator governor carter

 mr carter well i might say i think the league of conservation voters be absolutely right this administration 's record of environment be very bad

 i think it be accurate to say that the strip mining law which be pass twice by the congress and only lack two vote i believe of be overridden would have be good for the country the claim that it would have put 140,000 miner out of work be hard to believe when at the time mr. ford veto it the united mine workers be support the bill and i do not think they would have support the bill have they know that they would lose 140,000 job

 there have be a consistent policy on the part of this administration to lower or to delay enforcement of air pollution standard and water pollution standard and under both presidents nixon and ford money have be impound that would have go to city and other to control water pollution

 we have no energy policy we i think be the only develop nation in the world that have no comprehensive energy policy to permit we to plan in an orderly way how to shift from increase the scarce energy form oil and have research and development concentrate on the increase use of coal which i strongly favor the research and development to be use primarily to make the coal burning be clean

 we need a heritage trust program similar to the one we have in georgia to set aside additional land that have geological and archeological importance natural area for enjoyment the land that mr. ford brag about having approve be in alaska and they be enormous in size but as far as the accessibility of they by the american people be very far in the future

 we have take no strong position in the control of pollution of our ocean and i would say the bad threat to the environment of all be nuclear proliferation and this administration having be in office now for 2 year or more have still not take a strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world particularly plutonium

 those be some brief remark about the failure of this administration i would do the opposite in every respect

 the moderator mr. maynard to governor carter

 mr maynard governor federal policy in this country since world war ii have tend to favor the development of suburb at the great expense of central city do not the federal government now have an affirmative obligation to revitalize the american city we have hear little in this campaign suggest that you have an urban reconstruction program could you please outline your urban intention for we tonight

 mr carter yes i would be glad to in the first place as be the case with the environmental policy and energy policy that i just describe and the policy for nonproliferation of nuclear waste this administration have no urban policy it be impossible for mayor or governor to cooperate with the president because they can not anticipate what be go to happen next

 a mayor of a city like new york for example need to know 18 month or 2 year ahead of time what responsibility the city will have in administration and in financing in thing like housing pollution control crime control education welfare and health this have not be do unfortunately i remember the headline in the daily news that say ford to new york drop dead

 i think it be very important that our city know that they have a partner in the federal government quite often congress have pass law in the past design to help people with the ownership of home and with the control of crime and with adequate health care and well education program and so forth those program be design to help those who need it most and quite often this have be in the very poor people and neighborhood in the downtown urban center because of the greatly advantaged person who live in the suburb well education well organization more articulate more aware of what the law be quite often this money have be channel out of the downtown center where it be need

 also i favor all revenue share money be use for local government and also to remove the prohibition in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be use to improve education and health care we have now for instance only 7 percent of the total education cost be finance by the federal government when the nixon ford administration start this be 10 percent that be a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contribute to education in just 8 year and as you know the education cost have go up tremendously

 the last point be that the major thrust have get to be to put people back to work we have get an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto area particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority group sometimes 50 or 60 percent

 and the concentration of employment opportunity in those area would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare cost one of the major responsibility on the shoulder of new york city be to finance welfare and i favor the shifting of the welfare cost away from the local government altogether and over a long period of time let the federal government begin to absorb part of it that be now pay by the state government those thing would help a great deal with the city but we still have a very serious problem there

 the moderator president ford

 the president let i speak out very strongly the ford administration do have a very comprehensive program to help our major metropolitan area i fight for and the congress finally go along with a general revenue sharing program whereby city and states the city two third and the states one third get over $ 6 billion a year in cash with which they can provide many many service whatever they really want

 in addition we in the federal government make available to city about $ 3,300 million in what we call community development in addition as a result of my pressure on the congress we get a major mass transit program over a 4 year period--$11,800 million we have a good housing program that will result in cut the down payment by 50 percent and have mortgage payment low at the beginning of any mortgage period we be expand our homestead housing program

 the net result be we think under carla hills who be the chairman of my urban development and neighborhood revitalization program we will really do a first class job in help the community throughout the country as a matter of fact that committee under secretary hills release about a 75 page report with specific recommendation so we can do a well job in the week ahead

 and in addition the tax program of the ford administration which provide an incentive for industry to move into our major metropolitan area into the inner city will bring job where people be and help to revitalize those city as they can be

 the moderator mr. nelson your question next to president ford

 mr nelson mr. president your campaign have run ad in black newspaper say that for black americans president ford be quietly get the job do yet study after study have show little progress in desegregation and in fact actual increase in segregated school and housing in the northeast

 now civil right group have complain repeatedly that there have be lack of progress in commitment to an integrated society during your administration so how be you get the job do for black and other minority and what program do you have in mind for the next 4 year

 the president well let i say at the outset i be very proud of the record of this administration in the cabinet i have one of the outstanding i think administrator as the secretary of transportation bill coleman you be familiar i be sure with the recognition give in the air force to general james and there be just approve a three star admiral the first in the history of the united states navy so we be give full recognition to individual of quality in the ford administration in position of great responsibility

 in addition the department of justice be fully enforce and enforce effectively the voting rights act the legislation that involve job housing for minority not only black but all other

 the department of hud be enforce the new legislation that take care of redline what we be do be say that there be opportunity business opportunity educational opportunity responsibility where people with talent black or any other minority can fully qualify

 the office of minority business in the department of commerce have make available more money in try to help black businessman or other minority businessman than any other administration since the office be establish

 the office of small business under mr. kobelinski have a very massive program try to help the black community the individual who want to start a business or expand his business as a black businessman be able to borrow either directly or with guarantee loan

 i believe on the record that this administration have be responsive and have carry out the law to the letter and i be proud of the record

 the moderator governor carter your response please

 mr carter the description just make of this administration 's record be hard to recognize i think it be accurate to say that mr. ford vote against the voting right act and against the civil right act in their debative stage i think once it be assure they be go to pass he finally vote for it

 this country change drastically in 1969 when the term of john kennedy and lyndon johnson be over and richard nixon and gerald ford become the president there be a time when there be hope for those who be poor and downtrodden and who be elderly or who be ill or who be in minority group that time have be go

 i think the great thing that ever happen to the south be the passage of the civil right act and the opening up of opportunity to black people to have a chance to vote to hold a job to buy a house to go to school and to participate in public affair it not only liberated black people but it also liberate the white

 we have see in many instance in recent year a minority affair section of a small loan administration small business administration lend a black entrepreneur just enough money to get start and then to go bankrupt the bankruptcy have go up an extraordinary degree

 the fha federal housing administration which use to be a very responsible agency that everyone look to to help own a home lose $ 600 million last year there have be over 1,300 indictment in hud over 800 conviction relate just to home loan and now the federal government have become the world 's great slum landlord

 we have get a 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment rate among minority young people and there have be no concerted effort give to the need of those who be both poor and black or poor and who speak a foreign language and that be where there have be a great generation of despair and ill health and lack of education and lack of purposefulness and a lack of hope for the future

 but it do not take just a quiet dormant minimum enforcement of the law it require an aggressive searching out and reach out to help people who especially need it and that be be lack in the last 8 year

 the moderator mr. kraft to governor carter

 mr kraft governor carter in the nearly 200 year history of the constitution there have be only i think it be 25 amendment most of they on issue of the very broad principle now we have propose amendment in many highly specialized cause like gun control school busing balanced budget school prayer abortion thing like that do you think it be appropriate to the dignity of the constitution to tack on amendment in a wholesale fashion and which of the one i list that be balanced budget school busing school prayer abortion gun control which of those would you really work hard to support if you be president

 mr carter i would not work hard to support any of those we have always have i think a lot of constitutional amendment propose but the passage of they have be fairly slow and few and far between in the 200 year history there have be a very cautious approach to this quite often we have a transient problem i be strongly against abortion i think abortion be wrong i do not think the government ought to do anything to encourage abortion but i do not favor a constitutional amendment on the subject but short of a constitutional amendment and within the confine of a supreme court ruling i will do everything i can to minimize the need for abortion with well sex education family planning with well adoptive procedure i personally do not believe that the federal government ought to finance abortion but i draw the line and do not support a constitutional amendment however i honor the right of people to seek the constitutional amendment on school busing on prayer in the school and on abortion but among those you name i will not actively work for the passage of any of they

 the moderator president ford your response please

 the president i support the republican platform which call for a constitutional amendment that would outlaw abortion i favor the particular constitutional amendment that would turn over to the states the individual right of the voter in those state the chance to make a decision by public referendum i call that the people amendment i think if you really believe that the people of a state ought to make a decision on a matter of this kind that we ought to have a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the 50 states to make the choice

 i think this be a reasonable and proper way to proceed i believe also that there be some merit to an amendment that senator everett dirksen propose very frequently an amendment that would change the court decision as far as voluntary prayer in public school it seem to i that there should be an opportunity as long as it be voluntary as long as there be no compulsion whatsoever that an individual ought to have that right

 so in those two case i think such a constitutional amendment would be proper and i really do not think in either case they be trivial matter i think they be matter of very deep conviction as far as many many people in this country believe and therefore they should not be treat lightly but they be matter that be important and in those two case i would favor they

 the moderator mr. maynard to president ford

 mr maynard mr. president twice you have be the intended victim of would be assassin use handgun yet you remain a steadfast opponent of substantive handgun control there be now some 40 million handgun in this country go up at the rate of 2.5 million a year and tragically those handgun be frequently purchase for self protection and wind up be use against a relative or a friend in light of that why do you remain so adamant in your opposition to substantive gun control in this country

 the president mr. maynard the record of gun control whether it be in one city or another or in some states do not show that the registration of a gun handgun or the registration of the gun owner have in any way whatsoever decrease the crime rate or the use of that gun in the committing of a crime the record just do not prove that such legislation or action by a local city council be effective

 what we have to do and this be the crux of the matter be to make it very very difficult for a person who use a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail if we make the use of a gun in the commission of a crime a serious criminal offense and that person be prosecute then in my opinion we be go after the person who use the gun for the wrong reason i do not believe in the registration of handgun or the registration of the handgun owner that have not prove to be effective and therefore i think the well way be to go after the criminal the individual who commit a crime in the possession of a gun and use that gun for a part of his criminal activity

 those be the people who ought to be in jail and the only way to do it be to pass strong legislation so that once apprehend indict convict they will be in jail and off the street and not use gun in the commission of a crime

 mr maynard but mr. president do not you think that the proliferation of the availability of handgun contribute to the possibility of those crime be commit and there be a second part to my follow up very quickly there be as you know and as you have say jurisdiction around the country with strong gun control law the police official in those city contend that if there be a national law to prevent other jurisdiction from provide the weapon that then come into place like new york that they might have a well handle on the problem have you consider that in your analysis of the handgun proliferation problem

 the president yes i have and the individual with whom i have consult have not convince i that a national registration of handgun or handgun owner will solve the problem you be talk about the person who want to use a gun for an illegal purpose can get it whether it be registered or outlaw they will be obtain and they be the people who ought to go behind bar you should not in the process penalize the legitimate handgun owner and when you go through the process of registration you in effect be penalize that individual who use his gun for a very legitimate purpose

 the moderator governor carter

 mr carter i think it be accurate to say that mr. ford 's position on gun control have change early mr. levi his attorney general put forward a gun control proposal which mr. ford later i believe espouse that call for the prohibition against the sale of the so call saturday night special it would have put very strict control over who own a handgun

 i have be a hunter all my life and happen to own both shotgun rifle and a handgun and the only purpose that i would see in register handgun and not long gun of any kind would be to prohibit the ownership of those gun by those who have use they in the commission of a crime or who have be prove to be mentally incompetent to own a gun i believe that limited approach to the question would be advisable and i think adequate but that be as far as i would go with it

 the moderator mr. nelson to governor carter

 mr nelson governor you have say the supreme court today be as you put it move back in the proper direction in ruling that have limit the right of criminal defendant and you have compare the present supreme court under chief justice burger very favorably with the more liberal court that we have under chief justice warren so exactly what be you get at and can you elaborate on the kind of court you think this country should have and can you tell we the kind of qualification and philosophy you would look for as president in make supreme court appointment

 mr carter while i be governor of georgia although i be not a lawyer we have complete reform of the georgia court system we streamline the structure of the court put in administrative office put a unified court system in and require that all severe sentence be review for uniformity and in addition to that put forward a proposal that be adopt and use throughout my own term of office selection of all judge and district attorney prosecute attorney on the basis of merit

 every time i have a vacancy on the georgia supreme court and i fill five of those vacancy out of seven total and about half of the court of appeals judge about 35 percent of the trial judge i be give from an objective panel the five most highly qualified person in georgia and from those five i always choose the first or second one so merit selection of judge be the most important single criterion and i would institute the same kind of procedure as president not only in judicial appointment but also in diplomatic appointment

 secondly i think that the burger court have fairly well confirm the major and most far reach and most controversial decision of the warren court civil right have be confirm by the burger court it have not be reverse and i do not think there be any inclination to reverse those basic decision of the one man one vote rule which be a very important one that strike down the unwarranted influence in the legislature of sparsely populate area of the states the right of indigent or very poor accuse person to legal counsel i think the burger court have confirm that basic and very controversial decision of the warren court also the protection of an arrest person against unwarranted persecution in try to get a false confession

 but now i think there have be a couple of instance where the burger court have make technical ruling where an obviously guilty person be later find to be guilty and i think that in that case some of the more liberal member of the so call warren court agree with those decision

 but the only thing that i have point out be what i have just say and that there be a need to clarify the technicality so that you could not be force to release a person who be obviously guilty just because of a small technicality in the law and that be a reversal of position by the burger court with which i do agree

 mr nelson governor i do not believe you answer my question though about the kind of people you would be look for for the court the type of philosophy you would be look for if you be make appointment to the supreme court as president

 mr carter okay i think i answer it by say that it would be on the basis of merit once the search and analysis procedure have be complete and once i be give a list of the 5 or 7 or 10 well qualified person in the country i would make a selection from among those person if the list be in my opinion fairly uniform if there be no outstanding person then i would undoubtedly choose someone who would most accurately reflect my own basic political philosophy as well as i could determine it which would be to continue the progress that have be make under the last two courts the warren court and the burger court

 i would also like to completely revise our criminal justice system to do some of the thing at the federal level and court reform that i just describe as have be do in georgia and other states and i would like to appoint people who would be interested in help with that i know chief justice burger be he have not have help yet from the administration and from the congress to carry this out

 the emphasis i think of the court system should be to interpret the constitution and the law equally between property protection and personal protection but when there be a very narrow decision which quite often be one that reach the supreme court i think the choice should be with human right and that would be another factor that i would follow

 the moderator president ford

 the president i think the answer as to the kind of person that i would select be obvious i have one opportunity to nominate an individual to the supreme court and i select the circuit court of appeals judge from illinois john paul stevens i select he because of his outstanding record as a circuit court of appeals judge and i be very pleased that an overwhelmingly democratic united states senate after go into his background come to the conclusion that he be fit and should serve and the vote in his behalf be overwhelming

 so i would say somebody in the format of justice stevens would be the kind of an individual that i would select in the future as i do he in the past

 i believe however a comment ought to be make about the direction of the burger court vis a vis the court that precede it it seem to i that the miranda case be a case that really make it very very difficult for the police the law enforcement people in this country to do what they could to make certain that the victim of a crime be protect and that those that commit crime be properly handle and send to jail the miranda case the burger court be gradually change and i be pleased to see that there be some step be make by the burger court to modify the so call miranda decision

 i might make a correction of what governor carter say speak of gun control yes it be true i believe that the sale of saturday night special should be cut out but he want the registration of handgun

 the moderator mr. kraft

 mr kraft mr. president the country be now in something that your adviser call an economic pause i think to most americans that sound like an antiseptic term for low growth unemployment standstill at a high high level decline in take home pay low factory earning more layoff be not that really a rotten record and do not your administration bear most of the blame for it

 the president well mr. kraft i violently disagree with your assessment and i do not think the record justify the conclusion that you come to let i talk about the economic announcement that be make just this past week

 yes it be announce that the gnp real growth in the third quarter be at 4 percent but do you realize that over the last 10 year that be a high figure than the average growth during the 10 year period now it be low than the 9.2 percent growth in the first quarter and it be low than the 5 percent growth in the second quarter but every economist liberal conservative that i be familiar with recognize that in the fourth quarter of this year and in the first quarter of next year that we will have an increase in real gnp

 but now let us talk about the plus that come out this week we have an 18 percent increase in housing start we have a substantial increase in new permit for housing as a matter of fact base on the announcement this week there will be at an annual rate 1 million 800 some thousand new house build which be a tremendous increase over last year and a substantial increase over the early part of this year

 now in addition we have some very good news in the reduction in the rate of inflation and inflation hit everybody those who be work and those who be on welfare the rate of inflation as announce just the other day be under 5 percent and the 4.4 percent that be indicate at the time of the 4 percent gnp be less than the 5.4 percent it mean that the american buyer be get a well bargain today because inflation be less

 mr kraft mr. president let i ask you this there have be an increase in layoff and that be something that bother everybody because even people that have a job be afraid they be go to be fire do you predict that increase in layoff do not that take you by surprise have not your administration be surprise by this pause in fact have not you be so obsess with save money that you do not even push the government to spend fund that be allocate

 the president mr. kraft i think the record can be put in this way which be the way that i think satisfie most americans since the depth of the recession we have add 4 million job most importantly consumer confidence as survey by the reputable organization at the university of michigan be at the high since 1972

 in other word there be a grow public confidence in the strength of this economy and that mean that there will be more industrial activity it mean that there will be a reduction in the unemployment it mean that there will be increase hire it mean that there will be increase employment

 now we have have this pause but most economist regardless of their political philosophy indicate that this pause for a month or two be healthy because we could not have honestly sustain a 9.2 percent rate of growth which we have in the first quarter of this year

 now i would like to point out as well that the united states economic recovery from the recession of a year ago be well ahead of the economic recovery of any major free industrial nation in the world today we be ahead of all of the western european country we be ahead of japan the united states be lead the free world out of the recession that be serious a year and a half ago

 we be go to see unemployment go down more job available and the rate of inflation go down and i think this be a record that the american people understand and will appreciate

 the moderator governor carter

 mr carter well with all due respect to president ford i think he ought to be ashamed of make that statement because we have the high unemployment rate now than we have at any time between the great depression cause by herbert hoover and the time president ford take office we have get 7 1/2 million people out of job since he have be in office 2 million more american people have lose their job in the last 4 month alone 500,000 americans have go on the unemployment roll in the last month we have have a net loss of 163,000 job

 anybody who say that the inflation rate be in good shape now ought to talk to the housewife one of the overwhelming result that i have see in place be people feel that you can not plan any more there be no way to make a prediction that my family might be able to own a home or to put my kid through college saving account be lose money instead of gain money inflation be rob we

 under the present administration nixon 's and ford' we have have three time the inflation rate that we experience under president johnson and president kennedy the economic growth be less than half today what it be at the beginning of this year and housing start he compare the housing start with last year i do not blame he because in 1975 we have few housing start in this country few home build than any year since 1940 that be 35 year and we have get a 35 percent unemployment rate in many area of this country among construction worker and mr. ford have not do anything about it and i think this show a callous indifference to the family that have suffer so much he have veto bill pass by congress within the congressional budget guideline job opportunity for 2 million americans we will never have a balanced budget we will never meet the need of our people we will never control the inflationary spiral as long as we have 7 or 8 million people out of work who be look for job and we have probably get 2 more million people who be not look for job any more because they have give up hope that be a very serious indictment of this administration it be probably the bad one of all

 the moderator mr. maynard

 mr maynard governor carter you enter this race against president ford with a 20 point lead or well in the poll and now it appear that this campaign be head for a photo finish you have say how difficult it be to run against a sit president but mr. ford be just as much an incumbent in july when you be 20 point ahead as he be now can you tell we what cause the evaporation of that lead in your opinion

 mr carter well that be not exactly an accurate description of what happen when i be that far ahead it be immediately follow the democratic convention and before the republican convention at that time 25 or 30 percent of the reagan supporter say that they would not support president ford but as occur at the end of the democratic convention the republican party unify itself and i think immediately follow the republican convention there be about a 10 point spread i believe that to be accurate i have 49 percent president ford have 39 percent

 the poll be good indication of fluctuation but they vary widely one from another and the only poll i have ever follow be the one that you know be take on election day i be in 30 primary in the spring and at first it be obvious that i do not have any standing in the poll as a matter of fact i think when gallup run their first poll in december 1975 they do not even put my name on the list they have 35 people on the list my name be not even there at the beginning of the year i have about 2 percent so the poll to i be interesting but they do not determine my hope or my despair

 i campaign among people i have never depend on powerful political figure to put i in office i have a direct relationship with hundred of thousand of people around the country who actively campaign for i in georgia alone for instance i get 84 percent of the vote and i think there be 14 people in addition to myself on the ballot and governor wallace have be very strong in georgia that be an overwhelming support from my own people who know i well and today we have about 500 georgians at their own expense just work people who believe in i spread around the country involve in the political campaign

 so the poll be interesting but i do not know how to explain the fluctuation i think a lot of it depend on current event sometimes foreign affair sometimes domestic affair but i think our core of support among those who be crucial to the election have be fairly steady and my success in the primary season be i think notable for a newcomer from someone who be outside of washington who never have be a part of the washington establishment and i think that we will have a good result on november 2 for myself and i hope for the country

 the moderator president ford your response

 the president i think the increase in the prospect as far as i be concerned and the less favorable prospect for governor carter reflect that governor carter be inconsistent in many of the position that he take he tend to distort on a number of occasion just a moment ago for example he be indicate that in the 1950 's for example unemployment be very low he fail to point out that in the 1950 's we be engage in the war in vietnam i mean in korea we have 3,500,000 young man in the army navy air force and marines that be not the way to end unemployment or to reduce unemployment

 at the present time we be at peace we have reduce the number of people in the army navy air force and marines from 3,500,000 to 2,100,000 we be not at war we have reduce the military manpower by 1,400,000 if we have that many more people in the army the navy the air force and marines our unemployment figure would be considerably less

 but this administration do not believe the way to reduce unemployment be to go to war or to increase the number of people in the military so you can not compare unemployment as you seek to at the present time with the 1950 's because the then administration have people in the military they be at war they be fight overseas and this administration have reduce the size of the military by 1,400,000 they be in the civilian labor market and they be not fight anywhere around the world today

 the moderator thank you gentleman

 this will complete our questioning for this debate we do not have time for more question and full answer so now each candidate will be allow up to 4 minute for a closing statement and at the original coin toss in philadelphia a month ago it be determined that president ford would make the first closing statement tonight

 president ford

 the president for 25 year i serve in the congress under five president i see they work i see they make very hard decision i do not always agree with their decision whether they be democratic or republican president for the last 2 year i have be the president and i have find from experience that it be much more difficult to make those decision than it be to second guess they

 i become president at the time that the united states be in a very troubled time we have inflation of over 12 percent we be on the brink of the bad recession in the last 40 year we be still deeply involved in the problem of vietnam the american people have lose faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself that situation call for i to first put the united states on a steady course and to keep our keel well balance because we have to face the difficult problem that have all of a sudden hit america

 i think most people know that i do not seek the presidency but i be ask for your help and assistance to be president for the next 4 year during this campaign we have see a lot of television show a lot of bumper sticker and a great many slogan of one kind or another but those be not the thing that count what count be that the united states celebrate its 200th birthday on july 4 as a result of that wonderful experience all over the united states there be a new spirit in america the american people be heal be work together the american people be move again and move in the right direction

 we have cut inflation by well than half we have come out of the recession and we be well on the road to real prosperity in this country again there have be a restoration of faith and confidence and trust in the presidency because i have be open candid and forthright i have never promise more than i could produce and i have produce everything that i promise we be at peace not a single young american be fight or die on any foreign soil tonight we have peace with freedom

 i have be proud to be president of the united states during these very troubled time i love america just as all of you love america it would be the high honor for i to have your support on november 2 and for you to say jerry ford you have do a good job keep on do it thank you and good night

 the moderator thank you president ford

 governor carter

 mr carter the major purpose of an election for president be to choose a leader someone who can analyze the depth of feeling in our country to set a standard for our people to follow to inspire people to reach for greatness to correct our defect to answer difficulty to bind ourselves together in a spirit of unity

 i do not believe the present administration have do that we have be discourage and we have be alienate sometimes we have be embarrassed sometimes we have be ashamed our people be out of work and there be a sense of withdrawal

 but our country be innately very strong mr. ford be a good and decent man but he have be in office now more than 800 day approach almost as long as john kennedy be in office i would like to ask the american people what have be accomplish a lot remain to be do

 my own background be different from his i be a school board member and a library board member i serve on a hospital authority and i be in the state senate and i be governor and i be an engineer a naval officer a farmer a businessman i believe we require someone who can work harmoniously with the congress and can work closely with the people of this country and who can bring a new image and a new spirit to washington

 our tax structure be a disgrace and need to be reform i be governor of georgia for 4 year we never increase sale taxis or income tax or property taxis as a matter of fact the year before we go out of office we give a $ 50 million refund to the property taxpayer of georgia

 we spend $ 600 per person in this country every man woman and child for health care we still rank 15th among all of the nation in the world in infant mortality and our cancer rate be high than any country in the world we do not have good health care we could have it

 employment ought to be restore to our people we have become almost a welfare state we spend now 700 percent more on unemployment compensation than we do 8 year ago when the republicans take over the white house our people want to go back to work our education system can be improve secrecy ought to be strip away from government and a maximum of personal privacy ought to be maintain our housing program have go bad it use to be that the average family could own a house but now less than a third of our people can afford to buy their own home

 the budget be more grossly out of balance last year than ever before in the history of our country--$65 billion primarily because our people be not at work inflation be rob we as we have already discuss and the government bureaucracy be just a horrible mess

 this do not have to be i do not know all of the answer nobody could but i do know that if the president of the united states and the congress of the united states and the people of the united states say i believe our nation be great than what we be now i believe that if we be inspire if we can achieve a degree of unity if we can set our goal high enough and work toward recognize goal with industry and labor and agriculture along with government at all level we can achieve great thing

 we might have to do it slowly there be no magic answer to it but i believe together we can make great progress we can correct our difficult mistake and answer those very tough question

 i believe in the greatness of our country and i believe the american people be ready for a change in washington we have be drift too long we have be dormant too long we have be discourage too long and we have not set an example for our own people but i believe that we can now establish in the white house a good relationship with congress a good relationship with our people set very high goal for our country and with inspiration and hard work we can achieve great thing and let the world know that be very important but more importantly let the people in our own country realize that we still live in the great nation on earth

mr. speaker mr. vice president member of the 95th congress and distinguished guest

 in accordance with the constitution i come before you once again to report on the state of the union

 this report will be my last maybe—[laughter]—but for the union it be only the first of such report in our third century of independence the close of which none of we will ever see we can be confident however that 100 year from now a freely elect president will come before a freely elect congress choose to renew our great republic 's pledge to the government of the people by the people and for the people

 for my part i pray the third century we be begin will bring to all americans our child and their child 's child a great measure of individual equality opportunity and justice a great abundance of spiritual and material blessing and a high quality of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness

 the state of the union be a measurement of the many element of which it be compose a political union of diverse state an economic union of vary interest an intellectual union of common conviction and a moral union of immutable ideal

 take in sum i can report that the state of the union be good there be room for improvement as always but today we have a more perfect union than when my stewardship begin

 as a people we discover that our bicentennial be much more than a celebration of the past it become a joyous reaffirmation of all that it mean to be americans a confirmation before all the world of the vitality and durability of our free institution i be proud to have be privileged to preside over the affair of our federal government during these eventful year when we prove as i say in my first word upon assume office that our constitution work our great republic be a government of law and not of man here the people rule

 the people have speak they have choose a new president and a new congress to work their will i congratulate you particularly the new member as sincerely as i do president elect carter in a few day it will be his duty to outline for you his priority and legislative recommendation tonight i will not infringe on that responsibility but rather wish he the very good in all that be good for our country

 during the period of my own service in this capitol and in the white house i can recall many orderly transition of governmental responsibility of problem as well as of position of burden as well as of power the genius of the american system be that we do this so naturally and so normally there be no soldier march in the street except in the inaugural parade no public demonstration except for some of the dancer at the inaugural ball the opposition party do not go underground but go on function vigorously in the congress and in the country and our vigilant press go right on probe and publish our fault and our folly confirm the wisdom of the framer of the first amendment

 because of the transfer of authority in our form of government affect the state of the union and of the world i be happy to report to you that the current transition be proceed very well i be determined that it should i want the new president to get off on an easy start than i have

 when i become president on august 9 1974 our nation be deeply divide and torment in rapid succession the vice president and the president have resign in disgrace we be still struggle with the after effect of a long unpopular and bloody war in southeast asia the economy be unstable and race toward the bad recession in 40 year people be lose job the cost of living be soar the congress and the chief executive be at loggerhead the integrity of our constitutional process and other institution be be question for more than 15 year domestic spending have soar as federal program multiply and the expense escalate annually during the same period our national security need be steadily shortchange in the grave situation which prevail in august 1974 our will to maintain our international leadership be in doubt

 i ask for your prayer and go to work

 in january 1975 i report to the congress that the state of the union be not good i propose urgent action to improve the economy and to achieve energy independence in 10 year i reassure america 's ally and seek to reduce the danger of confrontation with potential adversary i pledge a new direction for america 1975 be a year of difficult decision but americans respond with realism common sense and self discipline

 by january 1976 we be head in a new direction which i hold to be the right direction for a free society it be guide by the belief that successful problem solve require more than federal action alone that it involve a full partnership among all branch and all level of government and public policy which nurture and promote the creative energy of private enterprise institution and individual citizen

 a year ago i report that the state of the union be well in many way a lot well but still not good enough common sense tell i to stick to the steady course we be on to continue to restrain the inflationary growth of government to reduce taxis as well as spending to return local decision to local official to provide for long range sufficiency in energy and national security need i resist the immense pressure of an election year to open the floodgate of federal money and the temptation to promise more than i could deliver i tell it as it be to the american people and demonstrate to the world that in our spirited political competition as in this chamber americans can disagree without be disagreeable

 now after 30 month as your president i can say that while we still have a way to go i be proud of the long way we have come together

 i be proud of the part i have have in rebuild confidence in the presidency confidence in our free system and confidence in our future once again americans believe in themselves in their leader and in the promise that tomorrow hold for their child

 i be proud that today america be at peace none of our son be fight and die in battle anywhere in the world and the chance for peace among all nation be improve by our determination to honor our vital commitment in defense of peace and freedom

 i be proud that the united states have strong defense strong alliance and a sound and courageous foreign policy

 our alliance with major partner the great industrial democracy of western europe japan and canada have never be more solid consultation on mutual security defense and east west relation have grow close collaboration have branch out into new field such as energy economic policy and relation with the third world we have use many avenue for cooperation include summit meeting hold among major ally country the friendship of the democracy be deep warmer and more effective than at any time in 30 year

 we be maintain stability in the strategic nuclear balance and push back the specter of nuclear war a decisive step forward be take in the vladivostok accord which i negotiate with general secretary brezhnev joint recognition that an equal ceiling should be place on the number of strategic weapon on each side with resolve and wisdom on the part of both nation a good agreement be well within reach this year

 the framework for peace in the middle east have be build hope for future progress in the middle east be stir by the historic agreement we reach and the trust and confidence that we form thank to american leadership the prospect for peace in the middle east be bright than they have be in three decade the arab state and israel continue to look to we to lead they from confrontation and war to a new era of accommodation and peace we have no alternative but to persevere and i be sure we will the opportunity for a final settlement be great and the price of failure be a return to the bloodshed and hatred that for too long have bring tragedy to all of the people of this area and repeatedly edge the world to the brink of war

 our relationship with the people 's republic of china be prove its importance and its durability we be find more and more common ground between our two country on basic question of international affair

 in my two trip to asia as president we have reaffirm america 's continue vital interest in the peace and security of asia and the pacific basin establish a new partnership with japan confirm our dedication to the security of korea and reinforce our tie with the free nation of southeast asia

 an historic dialog have begin between industrial nation and develop nation most proposal on the table be the initiative of the united states include those on food energy technology trade investment and commodity we be well launch on this process of shape positive and reliable economic relation between rich nation and poor nation over the long term

 we have make progress in trade negotiation and avoid protectionism during recession we strengthen the international monetary system during the past two year the free world 's most important economic power have already bring about important change that serve both develop and develop economy the momentum already achieve must be nurture and strengthen for the prosperity of the rich and poor depend upon it

 in latin america our relation have take on a new maturity and a sense of common enterprise

 in africa the quest for peace racial justice and economic progress be at a crucial point the united states in close cooperation with the united kingdom be actively engage in this historic process will change come about by warfare and chaos and foreign intervention or will it come about by negotiate and fair solution ensure majority rule minority right and economic advance america be commit to the side of peace and justice and to the principle that africa should shape its own future free of outside intervention

 american leadership have help to stimulate new international effort to stem the proliferation of nuclear weapon and to shape a comprehensive treaty govern the use of ocean

 i be gratify by these accomplishment they constitute a record of broad success for america and for the peace and prosperity of all mankind this administration leave to its successor a world in well condition than we find we leave as well a solid foundation for progress on a range of issue that be vital to the well being of america

 what have be achieve in the field of foreign affair and what can be accomplish by the new administration demonstrate the genius of americans work together for the common good it be this our remarkable ability to work together that have make we a unique nation it be congress the president and the people strive for a well world

 i know all patriotic americans want this nation 's foreign policy to succeed i urge member of my party in this congress to give the new president loyal support in this area i express the hope that this new congress will reexamine its constitutional role in international affair

 the exclusive right to declare war the duty to advise and consent on the part of the senate the power of the purse on the part of the house be ample authority for the legislative branch and should be jealously guard but because we may have be too careless of these power in the past do not justify congressional intrusion into or obstruction of the proper exercise of presidential responsibility now or in the future there can be only one commander in chief in these time crisis can not be manage and war can not be wage by committee nor can peace be pursue solely by parliamentary debate to the ear of the world the president speak for the nation while he be of course ultimately accountable to the congress the court and the people he and his emissary must not be handicap in advance in their relation with foreign government as have sometimes happen in the past

 at home i be encourage by the nation 's recovery from the recession and our steady return to sound economic growth it be now continue after the recent period of uncertainty which be part of the price we pay for free election

 our most pressing need today and the future be more job productive permanent job create by a thriving economy we must revise our tax system both to ease the burden of heavy taxation and to encourage the investment necessary for the creation of productive job for all americans who want to work

 early this month i propose a permanent income tax reduction of $ 10 billion below current level include raise the personal exemption from $ 750 to $ 1,000 i also recommend a series of measure to stimulate investment such as accelerate depreciation for new plant and equipment in area of high unemployment a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 48 to 46 percent and eliminate the present double taxation of dividend i strongly urge the congress to pass these measure to help create the productive permanent job in the private economy that be so essential for our future

 all the basic trend be good we be not on the brink of another recession or economic disaster if we follow prudent policy that encourage productive investment and discourage destructive inflation we will come out on top and i be sure we will

 we have successfully cut inflation by more than half when i take office the consumer price index be rise at 12.2 percent a year during 1976 the rate of inflation be 5 percent

 we have create more job over four million more job today than in the spring of 1975 throughout this nation today we have over 88 million people in useful productive job more than at any other time in our nation 's history but there be still too many americans unemployed this be the great regret that i have as i leave office

 we bring about with the congress after much delay the renewal of the general revenue sharing we expand community development and federal manpower program we begin a significant urban mass transit program federal program today provide more fund for our state and local government than ever before—$70 billion for the current fiscal year through these program and other that provide aid directly to individual we have keep faith with our tradition of compassionate help for those who need it as we begin our third century we can be proud of the progress that we have make in meet human need for all of our citizen

 we have cut the growth of crime by nearly 90 percent two year ago crime be increase at the rate of 18 percent annually in the first three quarter of 1976 that growth rate have be cut to 2 percent but crime and the fear of crime remain one of the most serious problem face our citizen

 we have have some success and there have be some disappointment bluntly i must remind you that we have not make satisfactory progress toward achieve energy independence energy be absolutely vital to the defense of our country to the strength of our economy and to the quality of our life

 two year ago i propose to the congress the first comprehensive national energy program a specific and coordinated set of measure that would end our vulnerability to embargo blockade or arbitrary price increase and would mobilize u.s. technology and resource to supply a significant share of the free world 's energy after 1985 of the major energy proposal i submit two year ago only half belatedly become law in 1973 we be dependent upon foreign oil import for 36 percent of our need today we be 40 percent dependent and we will pay out $ 34 billion for foreign oil this year such vulnerability at present or in the future be intolerable and must be end

 the answer to where we stand on our national energy effort today remind i of the old argument about whether the tank be half full or half empty the pessimist will say we have half fail to achieve our 10 year energy goal the optimist will say that we have half succeed i be always an optimist but we must make up for lost time

 we have lay a solid foundation for complete the enormous task which confront we i have sign into law five major energy bill which contain significant measure for conservation resource development stockpiling and standby authority we have move forward to develop the naval petroleum reserve to build a 500 million barrel strategic petroleum stockpile to phase out unnecessary government allocation and price control to develop a last relationship with other oil consume nation to improve the efficiency of energy use through conservation in automobile building and industry and to expand research on new technology and renewable resource such as wind power geothermal and solar energy all these action significant as they be for the long term be only the beginning

 i recently submit to the congress my proposal to reorganize the federal energy structure and the hard choice which remain if we be serious about reduce our dependence upon foreign energy these include program to reverse our decline production of natural gas and increase incentive for domestic crude oil production i propose to minimize environmental uncertainty affect coal development expand nuclear power generation and create an energy independence authority to provide government financial assistance for vital energy program where private capital be not available

 we must explore every reasonable prospect for meet our energy need when our current domestic reserve of oil and natural gas begin to dwindle in the next decade i urgently ask congress and the new administration to move quickly on these issue this nation have the resource and the capability to achieve our energy goal if its government have the will to proceed and i think we do

 i have be disappoint by inability to complete many of the meaningful organizational reform which i contemplate for the federal government although a start have be make for example the federal judicial system have long serve as a modal for other court but today it be threaten by a shortage of qualified federal judge and an explosion of litigation claim federal jurisdiction i commend to the new administration and the congress the recent report and recommendation of the department of justice undertake at my request on the need of the federal court i especially endorse its proposal for a new commission on the judicial appointment process

 while the judicial branch of our government may require reinforcement the budget and payroll of the other branch remain staggering i can not help but observe that while the white house staff and the executive office of the president have be reduce and the total number of civilian in the executive branch contain during the 1970 the legislative branch have increase substantially although the membership of the congress remain at 535 congress now cost the taxpayer more than a million dollar per member the whole legislative budget have pass the billion dollar mark

 set out to reduce the growth in the size and spending of the federal government but no president can accomplish this alone the congress sidetrack most of my request for authority to consolidate overlap program and agency to return more decisionmaking and responsibility to state and local government through block grant instead of rigid categorical program and to eliminate unnecessary red tape and outrageously complex regulation

 we have make some progress in cut back the expansion of government and its intrusion into individual life but believe i there be much more to be do and you and i know it it can only be do by tough and temporarily painful surgery by a congress as prepare as the president to face up to this very real political problem again i wish my successor work with a substantial majority of his own party the good of success in reform the costly and cumbersome machinery of the federal government

 the task of self government be never finish the problem be great the opportunity be great

 america 's first goal be and always will be peace with honor america must remain first in keep peace in the world we can remain first in peace only if we be never second in defense

 in present the state of the union to the congress and to the american people i have a special obligation as commander in chief to report on our national defense our survival as a free and independent people require above all strong military force that be well equipped and highly train to perform their assign mission

 i be particularly gratified to report that over the past two year we have be able to reverse the dangerous decline of the previous decade in real resource this country be devote to national defense this be an immediate problem i face in 1974 the evidence be unmistakable that the soviet union have be steadily increase the resource it apply to build its military strength during this same period the united states real defense spending decline in my three budget we not only arrest that dangerous decline but we have establish the positive trend which be essential to our ability to contribute to peace and stability in the world

 the vietnam war both materially and psychologically affect our overall defense posture the dangerous anti military sentiment discourage defense spending and unfairly disparage the man and woman who serve in our armed force

 the challenge that now confront this country be whether we have the national will and determination to continue this essential defense effort over the long term as it must be continue we can no long afford to oscillate from year to year in so vital a matter indeed we have a duty to look beyond the immediate question of budget and to examine the nature of the problem we will face over the next generation

 i be the first recent president able to address long term basic issue without the burden of vietnam the war in indochina consume enormous resource at the very time that the overwhelming strategic superiority we once enjoy be disappear in past year as a result of decision by the united states our strategic force level off yet the soviet union continue a steady constant buildup of its own force commit a high percentage of its national economic effort to defense

 the united states can never tolerate a shift in strategic balance against we or even a situation where the american people or our ally believe the balance be shift against we the united states would risk the most serious political consequence if the world come to believe that our adversary have a decisive margin of superiority

 to maintain a strategic balance we must look ahead to the 1980 and beyond the sophistication of modern weapon require that we make decision now if we be to ensure our security 10 year from now therefore i have consistently advocate and strongly urge that we pursue three critical strategic program the trident missile launch submarine the b-1 bomber with its superior capability to penetrate modern air defense and a more advanced intercontinental ballistic missile that will be well able to survive nuclear attack and deliver a devastating retaliatory strike

 in an era where the strategic nuclear force be in rough equilibrium the risk of conflict below the nuclear threshold may grow more perilous a major long term objective therefore be to maintain capability to deal with and thereby deter conventional challenge and crisis particularly in europe

 we can not rely solely on strategic force to guarantee our security or to deter all type of aggression we must have superior naval and marine force to maintain freedom of the sea strong multipurpose tactical air force and mobile modern ground force accordingly i have direct a long term effort to improve our worldwide capability to deal with regional crisis

 i have submit a five year naval building program indispensable to the nation 's maritime strategy because the security of europe and the integrity of nato remain the cornerstone of american defense policy i have initiate a special long term program to ensure the capacity of the alliance to deter or defeat aggression in europe

 as i leave office i can report that our national defense be effectively deter conflict today our armed force be capable of carry out the variety of mission assign to they program be underway which will assure we can deter war in the year ahead but i also must warn that it will require a sustained effort over a period of year to maintain these capability we must have the wisdom the stamina and the courage to prepare today for the peril of tomorrow and i believe we will

 as i look to the future and i assure you i intend to go on do that for a good many year i can say with confidence that the state of the union be good but we must go on make it well and well

 this gathering symbolize the constitutional foundation which make continue progress possible synchronize the skill of three independent branch of government reserve fundamental sovereignty to the people of this great land it be only as the temporary representative and servant of the people that we meet here we bring no hereditary status or gift of infallibility and none follow we from this place

 like president washington like the more fortunate of his successor i look forward to the status of private citizen with gladness and gratitude to i be a citizen of the united states of america be the great honor and privilege in this world

 from the opportunity which fate and my fellow citizen have give i as a member of the house as vice president and president of the senate and as president of all the people i have come to understand and place the high value on the check and balance which our founder impose on government through the separation of power among co equal legislative executive and judicial branch this often result in difficulty and delay as i well know but it also place supreme authority under god beyond any one person any one branch any majority great or small or any one party the constitution be the bedrock of all our freedom guard and cherish it keep honor and order in your own house and the republic will endure

 it be not easy to end these remark in this chamber along with some of you i have experience many many of the highlight of my life it be here that i stand 28 year ago with my freshman colleague as speaker sam rayburn administer the oath i see some of you now charlie bennett dick bolling carl perkins pete rodino harley staggers tom steed sid yates clem zablocki and i remember those who have go to their rest it be here we wage many many a lively battle win some lose some but always remain friend it be here surround by such friend that the distinguished chief justice swear i in as vice president on december 6 1973 it be here i return eight month later as your president to ask not for a honeymoon but for a good marriage

 i will always treasure those memory and your many many kindness i thank you for they all

 my fellow americans i once ask you for your prayer and now i give you mine may god guide this wonderful country its people and those they have choose to lead they may our third century be illuminate by liberty and bless with brotherhood so that we and all who come after we may be the humble servant of thy peace amen

 good night god bless you



for myself and for our nation i want to thank my predecessor for all he have do to heal our land

 in this outward and physical ceremony we attest once again to the inner and spiritual strength of our nation as my high school teacher miss julia coleman use to say we must adjust to change time and still hold to unchanging principle

 here before i be the bible use in the inauguration of our first president in 1789 and i have just take the oath of office on the bible my mother give i a few year ago open to a timeless admonition from the ancient prophet micah he hath show thee o man what be good and what doth the lord require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god micah 6:8

 this inauguration ceremony mark a new beginning a new dedication within our government and a new spirit among we all a president may sense and proclaim that new spirit but only a people can provide it

 two century ago our nation 's birth be a milestone in the long quest for freedom but the bold and brilliant dream which excite the founder of this nation still await its consummation i have no new dream to set forth today but rather urge a fresh faith in the old dream

 ours be the first society openly to define itself in term of both spirituality and of human liberty it be that unique self definition which have give we an exceptional appeal but it also impose on we a special obligation to take on those moral duty which when assume seem invariably to be in our own good interest

 you have give i a great responsibility to stay close to you to be worthy of you and to exemplify what you be let we create together a new national spirit of unity and trust your strength can compensate for my weakness and your wisdom can help to minimize my mistake

 let we learn together and laugh together and work together and pray together confident that in the end we will triumph together in the right

 the american dream endure we must once again have full faith in our country and in one another i believe america can be well we can be even strong than before

 let our recent mistake bring a resurgent commitment to the basic principle of our nation for we know that if we despise our own government we have no future we recall in special time when we have stand briefly but magnificently unite in those time no prize be beyond our grasp

 but we can not dwell upon remember glory we can not afford to drift we reject the prospect of failure or mediocrity or an inferior quality of life for any person our government must at the same time be both competent and compassionate

 we have already find a high degree of personal liberty and we be now struggle to enhance equality of opportunity our commitment to human right must be absolute our law fair our natural beauty preserve the powerful must not persecute the weak and human dignity must be enhance

 we have learn that more be not necessarily well that even our great nation have its recognize limit and that we can neither answer all question nor solve all problem we can not afford to do everything nor can we afford to lack boldness as we meet the future so together in a spirit of individual sacrifice for the common good we must simply do our good

 our nation can be strong abroad only if it be strong at home and we know that the good way to enhance freedom in other land be to demonstrate here that our democratic system be worthy of emulation

 to be true to ourselves we must be true to other we will not behave in foreign place so as to violate our rule and standard here at home for we know that the trust which our nation earn be essential to our strength

 the world itself be now dominate by a new spirit people more numerous and more politically aware be crave and now demand their place in the sun not just for the benefit of their own physical condition but for basic human right

 the passion for freedom be on the rise tap this new spirit there can be no nobler nor more ambitious task for america to undertake on this day of a new beginning than to help shape a just and peaceful world that be truly humane

 we be a strong nation and we will maintain strength so sufficient that it need not be prove in combat a quiet strength base not merely on the size of an arsenal but on the nobility of idea

 we will be ever vigilant and never vulnerable and we will fight our war against poverty ignorance and injustice for those be the enemy against which our force can be honorably marshal

 we be a purely idealistic nation but let no one confuse our idealism with weakness

 because we be free we can never be indifferent to the fate of freedom elsewhere our moral sense dictate a clearcut preference for these society which share with we an abide respect for individual human right we do not seek to intimidate but it be clear that a world which other can dominate with impunity would be inhospitable to decency and a threat to the well being of all people

 the world be still engage in a massive armament race design to ensure continue equivalent strength among potential adversary we pledge perseverance and wisdom in our effort to limit the world 's armament to those necessary for each nation 's own domestic safety and we will move this year a step toward ultimate goal the elimination of all nuclear weapon from this earth we urge all other people to join we for success can mean life instead of death

 within we the people of the united states there be evident a serious and purposeful rekindling of confidence and i join in the hope that when my time as your president have end people might say this about our nation


	 that we have remember the word of micah and renew our search for humility mercy and justice
	 that we have tear down the barrier that separate those of different race and region and religion and where there have be mistrust build unity with a respect for diversity
	 that we have find productive work for those able to perform it
	 that we have strengthen the american family which be the basis of our society
	 that we have ensure respect for the law and equal treatment under the law for the weak and the powerful for the rich and the poor
	 and that we have enable our people to be proud of their own government once again


 i would hope that the nation of the world might say that we have build a last peace build not on weapon of war but on international policy which reflect our own most precious value

 these be not just my goal and they will not be my accomplishment but the affirmation of our nation 's continue moral strength and our belief in an undiminished ever expand american dream

good evening
 tomorrow will be two week since i become president i have spend a lot of time decide how i can be a good president this talk which the broadcast network have agree to bring to you be one of several step that i will take to keep in close touch with the people of our country and to let you know informally about our plan for the come month
 when i be run for president i make a number of commitment i take they very seriously i believe that they be the reason that i be elect and i want you to know that i intend to carry they out as you probably notice already i have act on several of my promise
 i will report to you from time to time about our government both our problem and our achievement but tonight i want to tell you how i plan to carry out some of my other commitment
 some of our obvious goal can be achieve very quickly for example through executive order and decision make directly by i but in many other area we must move carefully with full involvement by the congress allow time for citizen to participate in careful study in order to develop predictable long range program that we can be sure be affordable and that we know will work
 some of these effort will also require dedication perhaps even some sacrifice from you but i do not believe that any of we be afraid to learn that our national goal require cooperation and mutual effort
 one of our most urgent project be to develop a national energy policy as i point out during the campaign the united states be the only major industrial country without a comprehensive long range energy policy
 the extremely cold weather this winter have dangerously deplete our supply of natural gas and fuel oil and force hundred of thousand of worker off the job i congratulate the congress for its quick action on the emergency natural gas act which be pass today and sign just a few minute ago but the real problem our failure to plan for the future or to take energy conservation seriously start long before this winter and it will take much long to solve
 i realize that many of you have not believe that we really have an energy problem but this winter have make all of we realize that we have to act
 now the congress have already make many of the preparation for energy legislation presidential assistant dr. james schlesinger be begin to direct an effort to develop a national energy policy many group of americans will be involve on april 20 we will have complete the planning for our energy program and will immediately then ask the congress for its help in enact comprehensive legislation
 our program will emphasize conservation the amount of energy be waste which could be save be great than the total energy that we be import from foreign country we will also stress development of our rich coal reserve in an environmentally sound way we will emphasize research on solar energy and other renewable energy source and we will maintain strict safeguard on necessary atomic energy production
 the responsibility for set energy policy be now split among more than 50 different agency department and bureaus in the federal government later this month i will ask the congress for its help in combine many of these agency in a new energy department to bring order out of chaos congressional leader have already be work on this for quite a while
 we must face the fact that the energy shortage be permanent there be no way we can solve it quickly but if we all cooperate and make modest sacrifice if we learn to live thriftily and remember the importance of help our neighbor then we can find way to adjust and to make our society more efficient and our own life more enjoyable and productive utility company must promote conservation and not consumption oil and natural gas company must be honest with all of we about their reserve and profit we will find out the difference between real shortage and artificial one we will ask private company to sacrifice just as private citizen must do
 all of we must learn to waste less energy simply by keep our thermostat for instance at 65 degree in the daytime and 55 degree at night we could save half the current shortage of natural gas
 there be no way that i or anyone else in the government can solve our energy problem if you be not willing to help i know that we can meet this energy challenge if the burden be bear fairly among all our people and if we realize that in order to solve our energy problem we need not sacrifice the quality of our life
 the congress have make great progress toward responsible strip mining legislation so that we can produce more energy without unnecessary destruction of our beautiful land my administration will support these effort this year we will also ask congress for its help with legislation which will reduce the risk of future oil tanker spill and help deal with those that do occur
 i also state during my campaign that our administration would do everything possible to restore a healthy american economy
 our nation be build on the principle of work and not welfare productivity and not stagnation but i take office a couple of week ago in the middle of the bad economic slowdown of the last 40 year more than 7 1/2 million people who want to work can not find it accord to the late statistic because of high unemployment and idle factory the average american family like yours have be lose $ 1,800 a year in income and many billion of dollar have be add to the federal deficit
 also inflation hurt we all in every part of the country whether we have a job or whether we be look for a job we must race just to keep up with the constant rise in price inflation have hit we hard not in luxury but in the essential food energy health housing you see it every time you go shop
 i understand that unemployment and inflation be very real and have do great harm to many american family nothing make it hard to provide decent health housing and education for our people protect our environment or to realize our goal of a balanced budget than a stagnant economy
 as soon as i be elect the leader of the congress and my own adviser begin to work with i to develop a proposal for economic recovery we be guide by the principle that everyone who be able to work ought to work that our economic strength be base on a healthy productive private business sector that we must provide the great help to those with the great need and that there must be a predictable and a steady growth in our economy
 two day ago i present this plan to the congress it be a balanced plan with many clement to meet the many cause of our economic problem
 one element that i be sure you will like be reduce taxis this year the one time tax benefit to the average family of four with $ 10,000 in income will be $ 200 a 30 percent reduction in income taxis
 but my primary concern be still job and these one time tax rebate be the only quick effective way to get money into the economy and create those job
 but at the same time we be reduce taxis permanently by increase the standard deduction which most taxpayer claim again this family of four earn $ 10,000 will save $ 133 on a permanent basis about 20 percent on future income taxis this will also be a major step toward tax simplification allow 75 percent of all taxpayer to take the standard deduction and to file a very simple tax return quite different from the one that you will file this year
 we will also provide tax incentive to business firm to encourage they to fight inflation by expand output and to hire more of our people who be eager to work i think it make more sense for the government to help worker stay on the payroll than to force they onto unemployment benefit or welfare payment
 we have several proposal too in this legislation to help our city which have be especially hard hit by nationwide economic problem community where unemployment be bad will be eligible for additional money through the revenue sharing program a special program of public service employment will enable those who be now unemployed to contribute to their community in hospital nursing home park and recreation program and other related activity a strong public work program will permit the construction of select project which be need most
 these will not be make work project they will be especially valuable in community where budget cutback have reduce municipal service and they will also help to prevent local tax increase
 now because unemployment be most severe among special group of our people the young the disabled minority group we will focus our
 training program on they
 the top priority in our job training program will go to young veteran of the vietnam war unemployment be much high among veteran than among other of the same age who do not serve in the military i hope that put many thousand of veteran back to work will be one more step toward bind up the wound of the war year and toward help those who have help our country in the past
 i realize that very few people will think that this total economic plan be perfect many group would like to see more of one kind of aid and less of another but i be confident that this be the well balanced plan that we can produce for the overall economic health of the nation it will produce steady balanced sustainable growth it do not ignore inflation to solve unemployment or vice versa
 it do not ask one group of people to sacrifice solely for the benefit of another group it ask all of we to contribute participate and share to get the country back on the road to work again it be an excellent investment in the future
 i also say many time during the campaign that we must reform and reorganize the federal government i have often use the phrase competent and compassionate to describe what our government should be when the government must perform a function it should do it efficiently wherever free competition would do a well job of serve the public the government should stay out ordinary people should be able to understand how our own government work and to get satisfactory answer to question
 our confused and wasteful system that take so long to grow will take a long time to change the place to start be at the top in the white house i be reduce the size of the white house staff by nearly one third and i have ask the member of the cabinet to do the same at their top staff level soon i will put a ceiling on the number of people employ by the federal government agency so we can bring the growth of government under control
 we be now review the government 's 1,250 advisory committee and commission to see how many could be abolish without harm to the public
 we have eliminate some expensive and unnecessary luxury such as door to door limousine service for many top official include all member of the white house staff government official can not be sensitive to your problem if we be live like royalty here in washington while i be deeply grateful for the good wish that lie behind they i would like to ask that people not send gift to i or to my family or to anyone else who serve in my administration
 we will cut down also on government regulation and we will make sure that those that be write be in plain english for a change whenever a regulation be issue it will carry its author 's name and i will request the cabinet member to read all regulation personally before they be release
 this week i will ask the congress for enable legislation to let i reorganize the government the passage of this legislation which will give i the same authority extend to every president from franklin roosevelt through richard nixon and use by many governor across the country be absolutely crucial to a successful reorganization effort so far news from the congress because of their support be very encouraging
 the office of management and budget be now work on this plan which will include zero base budgeting removal of unnecessary government regulation sunset law to cancel program that have outlive their purpose and elimination of overlap and duplication among government service
 we will not propose change until we have do our good to be sure they be right but we will be eager to learn from experience if a program do not work we will end it instead of just start another to conceal our first mistake
 we will also move quickly to reform our tax system and welfare system
 i say in the campaign that our income tax system be a disgrace because it be so arbitrary complicated and unfair i make a commitment to a total overhaul of the income tax law
 the economic program that i have already mention early will by enable more taxpayer to use the standard deduction be just a first step toward a much well tax system
 my adviser have already start work with the congress on a study of a more complete tax reform which will give we a fair simple system we will outline the study procedure very soon and after consultation with many american citizen and with the congress we will present a comprehensive tax reform package before the end of this year
 the welfare system also need a complete overhaul welfare waste rob both the taxpayer of our country and those who really and genuinely need help it often force family to split it discourage people from seek work
 the secretary of labor and the secretary of health education and welfare and other have already begin a review of the entire welfare system they will of course work with the congress to develop proposal for a new system which will minimize abuse strengthen the family and emphasize adequate support for those who can not work and training and job for those who can work we expect their first report to be ready within 90 day
 in the meantime i will support the congress in its effort to deal with the widespread fraud and waste and abuse of our medicaid system
 reform the government also mean make the government as open and honest as it can be congress be move strongly on ethic legislation
 i have ask the people appoint by i to high position in government to abide by strict rule of financial disclosure and to avoid all conflict of interest i intend to make those rule permanent and i will select my appointee in such a way which will close the revolving door between government regulatory agency on the one hand and the business they regulate on the other
 my cabinet member and i will conduct an open administration with frequent press conference and report to the people and with town hall meeting all across the nation where you can criticize make suggestion and ask question
 we be also plan with some of the radio network live call in session in the oval office during which i can accept your phone call and answer the question that be on your mind i have ask the member of the cabinet to travel regularly around the country to stay in close touch with you out in your community where government service be deliver
 there be many other area of domestic policy housing health crime education agriculture and other that will concern i as president but which i do not have time to discuss tonight
 all of these project will take careful study and close cooperation with the congress many will take long than i would like but we be determined to work on all of they later through other report i will explain how with your help and the help of congress we can carry they out
 i have also make commitment about our nation 's foreign policy as commander in chief of the armed forces i be determined to have a strong lean efficient fighting force our policy should be base on close cooperation with our ally and worldwide respect for human right a reduction in world armament and it must always reflect our own moral value i want our nation 's action to make you proud
 yesterday vice president mondale return from his 10 day visit with leader of western europe and japan i ask he to make this trip to demonstrate our intention to consult our traditional ally and friend on all important question i have be very pleased with his report vice president mondale will be a constant and close adviser for i
 in a spirit of international friendship we will soon welcome here in the united states the leader of several nation begin with our neighbor canada and mexico
 this month the secretary of state cyrus vance will go to the middle east seek way to achieve a genuine peace between israel and its arab neighbor
 our ambassador to the united nations andrew young leave last night on a visit to africa to demonstrate our friendship for its people and our commitment to peaceful change toward majority rule in southern africa
 i will also strive to improve our relation with the soviet union and the people 's republic of china ensure our security while seek to reduce the risk of conflict
 we will continue to express our concern about violation of human right as we have during this past week without upset our effort toward friendly relationship with other country
 later on another program i will make a much more complete report to you on foreign policy matter
 i would like to tell you now about one of the thing that i have already learn in my brief time in office i have learn that there be many thing that a president can not do there be no energy policy that we can develop that would do more good than voluntary conservation there be no economic policy that will do as much as share faith in hard work efficiency and in the future of our system
 i know that both the congress and the administration as partner in leadership have limited power that be the way it ought to be but in the month in which i have campaign prepare to take office and now begin to serve as your president i have find a reason for optimism
 with the help of my predecessor we have come through a very difficult period in our nation 's history but for almost 10 year we have not have a sense of a common national interest we have lose faith in joint effort and mutual sacrifice because of the division in our country many of we can not remember a time when we really feel united
 but i remember another difficult time in our nation 's history when we feel a different spirit during world war ii we face a terrible crisis but the challenge of fight nazism draw we together
 those of we old enough to remember know that they be dark and frightening time but many of our memory be of people ready to help each other for the common good
 i believe that we be ready for that same spirit again to plan ahead to work together and to use common sense not because of war but because we realize that we must act together to solve our problem and because we be ready to trust one another
 as president i will not be able to provide everything that every one of you might like i be sure to make many mistake but i can promise that your need will never be ignore nor will we forget who put we in office
 we will always be a nation of difference business and labor black and white man and woman people of different region and religion and different ethnic background but with faith and confidence in each other our difference can be a source of personal fullness and national strength rather than a cause of weakness and division
 if we be a united nation then i can be a good president but i will need your help to do it i will do my good i know you will do your
 thank you very much and good night

the president good morning i have two brief statement to make and then i will be glad to answer question

 i have send to congress this morning a youth employment package which will consist of about $ 1/2 billion part of the economic stimulus package

 i have be particularly concerned in my own campaign trip around the country the last 2 year with the extraordinarily high unemployment rate among young people more than half the total unemployed be less than 24 year old and among those say from 16 to 19 year old we have over 18 percent unemployment and in some of the minority group in urban area more than 40 percent

 so we be go to try a heavy concentration of effort in several of the major department of government to cut down unemployment among our young people we have for instance a youth conservation corps similar to what we have during the depression year know as a civilian conservation corps the ccc this will be administer by the departments of agriculture and interior in the open space of our country

 we will have a youth community conservation corps in the urban area and a heavy emphasis on training for young people lead to employment include exist program this will be about a million job on a permanent basis plus another million job during the summer

 i hope that the congress will act quickly on this proposal i might say that many of the members of congress have be equally concerned and have do a great deal of work on this subject even before i become president

 the other item that i would like to mention be one that be already be report to some degree i have long be concerned about our own nation 's stance in prohibit american citizen to travel to foreign country we also be quite eagerly assess our own nation 's policy that violate human right as define by the helsinki agreement

 later on this year we will go to belgrade to assess the component part of the helsinki agreement and i want to be sure that we do not violate those right so i have instruct the secretary of state to remove any travel restriction on american citizen who want to go to vietnam to north korea to cuba and to cambodia and these restriction will be lift as of the 18th day of march

 i would like to point out that we still do not have diplomatic relationship with these country that be a doubtful prospect at this time so there will be some necessary precaution that ought to be take by citizen who go there since we do not have our own diplomat in those country to protect they if they should have difficulty

 i would be glad to answer any question that you might have

 ms. thomas helen thomas united press international

 q. mr. president an american delegate to the u.n. human rights commission have say that he believe and he hope that his allegation concern terror suffer in chile today coincide with your human right policy do they

 the president well i do not know which delegate this be or what his concern be but we be still concerned about deprivation of human right in many of the country of the world i think chile would be one of those where concern have be express and i want to be sure that the american people understand that this be a very sensitive issue

 we have try to be broad base in our expression of concern and also responsible at first our policy be interpret i think improperly to deal exclusively with the soviet union

 i have just point out how our own country have be at fault in some instance torture have be report to we from some of the nation of the world we be present these item to the congress as require by law but throughout the entire world in latin america in our own country in the communist nation in eastern europe and in the soviet union we be very much aware of the concern about human right

 i think it be entirely appropriate for our own country to take the leadership role and let the world say that the focal point for the preservation and protection of human right be in the united states of america i be proud of this and i intend to adhere to it with the deep possible personal commitment and i believe i speak accurately for the american people on this subject

 q. well then do that mean mr. president that you do not object to the remark that be make by our delegate

 the president i think that the remark make by the delegate concern our past involvement in chilean political affair be inappropriate i do not know about it ahead of time it be a personal expression of opinion by that delegate

 i think that the church committee in the senate have not find any evidence that the united states be involve in the overthrow of the allende government in chile there be some allegation make i think perhaps accurate that we do have financial aid and other i think financial aid to be restrictive to political element in chile that may have contribute to the change in government but i do not think there have be any proof of illegality there and the statement make by our delegate be his own personal statement not represent our government 's

 q. mr. president i gather the youth employment program you just announce be in addition to your economic stimulus program and i wonder how much money this add to the deficit in the 2 upcoming fiscal year

 the president no this be within the overall economic stimulus package already present to the congress

 q. mr. president there have be a lot of talk about defensible border lately and what that mean in regard to the middle east could i ask you sir do you feel that it would be appropriate in a middle east peace settlement for the israelis to keep some of the occupy land they take during the 1967 war in order to have secure border

 the president the defensible border phrase the secure border phrase obviously be just semantic i think it be a relatively significant development in the description of possible settlement in the middle east to talk about these thing as a distinction

 the recognized border have to be mutual the arab nation the israeli nation have to agree on permanent and recognize border where sovereignty be legal as mutually agree defense line may or may not conform in the foreseeable future to those legal border there may be extension of israeli defense capability beyond the permanent and recognize border

 i think this distinction be one that be now recognize by israeli leader the definition of border on a geographical basis be one that remain to be determine but i think that it be important for the world to begin to see and for the interested party to begin to see that there can be a distinction between the two the ability of israel to defend herself by international agreement or by the some time placement of israeli force themselves or by monitor station as have be the case in the sinai beyond the actual sovereignty border as mutually agree by israel and her neighbor

 q. well do that mean international zone between the country

 the president international zone could very well be part of an agreement and i think that i can see in a grow way a step by step process where there might be a mutual agreement that the ultimate settlement even include the border delineation would be at a certain describe point in an interim state maybe 2 year 4 year 8 year or more there would be a mutual demonstration of friendship and an end to the declaration or state of war

 i think that what israel would like to have be what we would like to have a termination of belligerence toward israel by her neighbor a recognition of israel 's right to exist the right to exist in peace the opening up of border with free trade tourist travel cultural exchange between israel and her neighbor in other word a stabilization of the situation in the middle east without a constant threat to israel 's existence by her neighbor

 this would involve substantial withdrawal of israel 's present control over territory now where that withdrawal might end i do not know i would guess it would be some minor adjustment in the 1967 border but that still remain to be negotiate

 but i think this be go to be a long tedious process we be go to mount a major effort in our own government in 1977 to bring the party to geneva obviously any agreement have to be between the party concern we will act as an intermediary when our good office will serve well

 but i be not try to predispose our own nation 's attitude towards what might be the ultimate detail of the agreement that can mean so much to world peace

 q. at the risk of oversimplification sir i believe i understand during the campaign you propose a gradual withdrawal of american troop from korea

 the president yes

 q. yet after your revise budget go to congress the army have go to congress and ask in fiscal 1978 for a doubling of military construction fund for korea and in the 3 ensue year for more than $ 110 million for similar construction how do that square with your withdrawal plan

 the president my commitment to withdraw american ground troop from korea have not change i will be meet this afternoon with the foreign minister of south korea this will be one of the matter that i will discuss

 i have also talk to general vessey who be in charge of our armed forces in south korea i think that the time period as i describe in the campaign month a 4 or 5 year time period be appropriate the schedule for withdrawal of american ground troop would have to be work out very carefully with the south korean government it would also have to be do with the full understanding and perhaps participation of japan

 i would want to leave in place in south korea adequate ground force own by and control by the south korean government to protect themselves against any intrusion from north korea i would envision a continuation of american air cover for south korea over a long period of time

 but these be the basic element and i be very determined that over a period of time as describe just then that our ground troop would be withdraw

 q. mr. president i would like to try to clarify the israeli situation if i might a moment ago in answer the question you speak of the possibility of substantial withdrawal of israeli control over territory and then just a few second later speak of the possibility of minor territorial concession by the israelis

 what be it exactly that you have in mind here be you really talk about some big withdrawal or be you talk only about minor withdrawal

 the president i do not think i would use the word minor withdrawal i think there might be minor adjustment to the 1967 pre-1967 border but that be a matter for israel and her neighbor to decide between themselves

 i believe that we will know by i would say the middle of may much more clearly the position of the interested party i have not yet meet nor talk to the leader in lebanon syria jordan egypt saudi arabia to a less direct participation degree

 i will meet with all these leader between now and the middle of may and i do not want to try to define in any specific term the exact delineation of border but i think this be obviously one of the most serious problem

 there be three basic element one be an ultimate commitment to complete peace in the middle east second border determination which be highly controversial and not yet be define by either side and third deal with the palestinian question

 and i be not try to act as the one to lay down an ultimate settlement i do not know what an ultimate settlement will be but these matter will be freely and openly debate within our own country and within the country involve and i think i have describe as good i can my own position

 q. mr. president the department of housing and urban development if i read secretary harris correctly seem to be move towards a policy that would promote racial integration of the suburb namely through the withholding of water and sewer and community development grant in community that lack a positive commitment to low- and moderate income housing what be your view on this

 the president well this be a subject that be well discuss during the campaign as you remember i think that the 1975 housing act i believe it be 1975 clearly describe a requirement that community that request federal help in establish housing have to put forward a positive proposal to ensure a mixture of housing in the entire community without regard to race and without regard to the economic level of the family involve

 this do not mean that every individual city block or suburban block have to have all different kind of housing in it it do mean that the overall package as propose to the federal government have to provide for a wide distribution of housing opportunity for those in minority group or those who have a low income

 and i believe that secretary harris statement be compatible with that law requirement

 q. mr. president last week in an interview you express concern about the disclosure of confidential and classified information admiral turner your choice to head the cia have say i believe in testimony that he would favor criminal penalty for disclosure by government official of that type of information but vice president mondale say he be opposed to it

 i wonder sir if you would tell we where you stand on that issue and what other than restrict access to classified information you intend to do about this problem

 the president well my own interest would be to minimize the use of any criminal penalty for disclosure of information there be other penalty that can be use without criminal charge and i think that vice president mondale draw that distinction

 i do not know yet what procedure we will follow my own hope would be that we could prevent the disclosure of intelligence information that might be damaging to our national security rather than try to control that problem by the imposition of legal criminal penalty

 q. could you elaborate on how you might prevent that mr. president

 the president well i think first of all be a tight control over the number of people who have access to material that be highly sensitive that might damage the relationship between our own country and our friend and ally we have already initiate step to that degree and we will be pursue it

 as you know admiral turner have only recently be confirm he be just now get his presence feel in the defense community i will be go out to the cia headquarters this afternoon to see the oath of office administer to he

 but we will make sure that the public know what new policy we impose but the one that be easy to describe and also very difficult to do be to make sure that we do not have too many people know about matter that they do not need to know and also that we can protect the legitimate confidentiality of agreement between ourselves and our ally

 now i would never permit anything that be either illegal or improper and we have get a very good arrangement that be primarily set up by president ford to prevent abuse the intelligence oversight board be make up of three distinguished man appoint by president ford who have complete access to any operation conduct by the intelligence force

 senator inouye 's committee in the senate and i think six committee in the house also have access to this information of course i be monitor it myself and i think admiral turner 's integrity be also a guarantee that there will be no future abuse

 but that do not mean that everything that we do in gather intelligence on which our security might very well depend have to be reveal to the public and draw of that distinction be one that be my responsibility and i think i can handle that

 q. what effect in your mind if any be the extent of debate in the senate over mr. warnke 's qualification to be the chief salt negotiator go to have eventually on our negotiating position

 the president i do not believe that the exact vote in the senate on mr. warnke 's confirmation will have a major effect on future negotiation with the soviet union on salt

 the obvious impression that concern i be a demonstration of lack of confidence of the senate in my own ability and attitude as a chief negotiator obviously as president any decision make with the russians on reduction of atomic weapon would have to be approve by i

 i have promise the joint chiefs of staff who in the past perhaps have be bypass in the process that they will always know ahead of time what our position will be at the negotiating table i have not promise the joint chiefs of staff that they would have the right to approve or disapprove every individual item in negotiation

 but i hope that the senate will give mr. warnke a strong vote i think many of the people that oppose mr. warnke just do not want to see any substantial reduction in atomic weapon even though they be agree to mutually by we and the soviet union or even if they be design to reduce the threat of nuclear destruction of the world

 i feel very deeply that we ought to pursue with every possible mean an agreement with the soviet union for substantial reduction in atomic weapon i think mr. warnke agree most of the senator agree

 so there be a wide range of reason for not vote for mr. warnke i have complete confidence in he and i might say there be one more very significant guard against any error that i and mr. warnke and the secretary of state and other might make the senate have to approve by a two third vote after complete open debate any agreement sign with the soviet union so i think that the attack on mr. warnke be primarily by those who do not want to see substantial reduction in nuclear weapon in the world

 q. it be widely report that a grand jury in washington may be investigate richard helms the former cia director to see whether to move forward on a case it be report that perhaps the jury will want to see certain cia document and i presume you would be the final arbiter have you be ask for those document and what will be your policy if you be ask for they in this case or any other case

 the president i have not be ask for any document and the helms case have not come to my attention either officially or even indirectly from any of the people involve

 whether or not to proceed with the case will be the exclusive right of the justice department the revelation of any document that affect our national security will be my own judgment in this or other case

 i can not respond any far than that because that be all i know about the subject

 q. mr. president if i may say sir the problem as you know relate to i guess national security consideration on the one hand and the legal system and justice on the other give the recent history i just wonder how closely you will weigh those two

 the president well the prosecution of the case have nothing to do with i that will be a judgment make by the justice department the actual revelation to a grand jury or in case of a trial if it should ever evolve of confidential or secret material would have to be judge by i

 q. that would control sir would it not whether the prosecution could go forward even if it choose

 the president it may or may not at that point the responsibility for make a judgment and the responsibility for the consequence of an inaccurate judgment if it should occur would be my own

 q. mr. president in connection with your concern about human right a task force on terrorism and violence last week present a report to attorney general bell regard recommendation they have to make on how we should handle civil disorder should they occur again like they do in the sixty it be a 600 page report fund the study be fund by the leaa and attorney general bell typify this as one of the good thing the leaa be do

 well sir in the report there be certain recommendation such as the use of mass arrest the use of preventive detention some of the very thing that be use in the sixty and later rule inappropriate by the court and i wonder sir what you feel about this problem involve human right in the united states

 the president i would be oppose to mass arrest and i would be oppose to preventive detention as a general policy and even as a specific policy unless it be an extreme case obviously in a 600 page report there would be thing with which we would agree and thing with which we would disagree i have not see the report i be not familiar with it but i think the abuse in the past have in many case exacerbate the disharmony that bring about demonstration and i think the arrest of large number of people without warrant or preventive detention be contrary to our own good system of government

 q. mr. president to follow on mr. donaldson 's sam donaldson abc news question on the helms case he ask you if document have be request

 the president they have not

 q. you say they have not mr. lipshutz your general counsel indicate to some reporter last week however that the matter of decision on release of information be in the white house be in his office and that would make it ultimately up to you

 now have the justice department not ask permission to declassify document that they may have get from other source from other department of the government in this case

 the president if they have ask for it it have not come to my attention i can not say that somewhere in the pipeline from the justice department the state department the cia or even my own counsel that request have be make but i have not be aware of they

 q. be question concern mr. lipshutz 's statement communicate to you last friday after some briefing in the white house

 the president i have not receive any request from mr. lipshutz obviously when something get to the white house it take time for they to staff it and give i the option i have to address and since i be not an attorney to give i some opinion on the legality of but it have not come to my attention at all

 q. you can not say whether he have it in his office

 the president i do not know

 q. mr. president i understand that you have agree to speak on the telephone to the man in ohio who be hold a police official hostage after he release he be you concerned that this might be regard as a precedent

 the president yes i be

 q. what be the factor that you weigh in that regard

 the president the request be make to i to talk to mr. moore as a precondition for his release the police officer who now have be hold about 24 hour i reply that i would be glad to talk to mr. moore after the police officer be release

 it be perhaps a dangerous precedent to establish i weigh that factor before i make my own decision i understand that mr. moore have promise to release the police officer after this news conference regardless of any comment that i might make on it and i hope that the police officer will be release but if he should be release i will talk to mr. moore

 q. mr. president i would like to go just a little bit far in your discussion of the defensible border issue

 if i understand you correctly you be talk about the possibility of something like an israeli defense line along the jordan river and perhaps at some point on the sinai desert and perhaps at some point on the golan heights that would be defense force but not legal border

 have i understand that correctly that your feeling be that the israelis be go to have to have some kind of defense force along the jordan river and in those other place

 the president well you add a great deal to what i say in the first place i do not mention any particular part of the geography around israel and i do not confine the defense capability to israeli force these might very well be international force it might very well be a line that be fairly broad say 20 kilometer or more where demilitarization be guarantee on both side it might very well consist of outpost electronic or perhaps personnel outpost as be establish in the sinai region as a result of the egypt and israeli agreement

 i be not go to try to get more specific in say what will or will not be the case but that be a possibility that might lead to the alleviation of tension there and it be one about which i will be discuss this matter with the representative from the arab country when they come

 q. mr. president mr. schlesinger recently tell the senate committee that your april 20th energy policy recommendation will emphasize a switch from oil and gas to coal but he stop short of say that you will support mandatory exclusion of oil and gas as boiler fuel what be your position on that

 the president we have not address that question yet how to encourage or perhaps even to force the end of waste natural gas just for the generation of heat at central power plant station be something that we will have to address it may be do by legislation it may be do by economic penalty it may be do by an appeal to the stationary heat producer to shift on a patriotic basis i can not yet say which of the proposal will be mandatory and which will be voluntary

 q. on several occasion mr. president you have speak in term of the u.s. be ready to move to a quick salt agreement omit cruise missile backfire bomber if necessary i be wonder sir have you have any indication yet of russian intention on this subject

 the president the soviet union so far as i know still would like to include the cruise missile question in the present negotiation they do not want to discuss backfire bomber at all and my hope have be and be that by the exclusion of both those controversial item which will require long and tedious negotiation that we might move to a rapid agreement at salt ii and immediately begin to discuss for instance the backfire bomber the cruise missile in subsequent negotiation but i do not have any indication yet that the soviets have change their position on that issue

 q. mr. president what about nuclear reduction

 the president again i think you have two approach to the question

 i have propose both directly and indirectly to the soviet union publicly and privately that we try to identify those item on which there be relatively close agreement not completely yet because detail be very difficult on occasion but i have for instance suggest that we forgo the opportunity to arm satellite body and also to forgo the opportunity to destroy observation satellite

 we have also propose that the indian ocean be completely demilitarize that a comprehensive test ban be put into effect that prior notification of test missile launching be exchange and i would like to see any of these item on which the soviets will agree quickly be conclude and then get down to the much more difficult negotiation on much more drastic overall commitment to atomic weapon lead ultimately to the complete elimination of atomic weapon from the face of the earth

 this be go to be a long slow tedious process but i think if we and the soviets could agree on the easy item and none of they be very easy quickly it would show good faith i think it would let the world know that we be serious in stop once and for all what have be a continuous and rapid escalation in atomic weapon capability since they be first evolve

 frank cormier associated press thank you mr. president

 the president thank you very much

good evening
 tonight i want to have an unpleasant talk with you about a problem that be unprecedented in our history with the exception of prevent war this be the great challenge that our country will face during our lifetime
 the energy crisis have not yet overwhelm we but it will if we do not act quickly it be a problem that we will not be able to solve in the next few year and it be likely to get progressively bad through the rest of this century
 we must not be selfish or timid if we hope to have a decent world for our child and our grandchild we simply must balance our demand for energy with our rapidly shrink resource by act now we can control our future instead of let the future control we
 two day from now i will present to the congress my energy proposal its member will be my partner and they have already give i a great deal of valuable advice
 many of these proposal will be unpopular some will cause you to put up with inconvenience and to make sacrifice the most important thing about these proposal be that the alternative may be a national catastrophe further delay can affect our strength and our power as a nation
 our decision about energy will test the character of the american people and the ability of the president and the congress to govern this nation this difficult effort will be the moral equivalent of war except that we will be unite our effort to build and not to destroy
 now i know that some of you may doubt that we face real energy shortage the 1973 gas line be go and with this springtime weather our home be warm again but our energy problem be bad tonight than it be in 1973 or a few week ago in the dead of winter it be bad because more waste have occur and more time have pass by without our planning for the future and it will get bad every day until we act
 the oil and natural gas that we rely on for 75 percent of our energy be simply run out in spite of increase effort domestic production have be drop steadily at about 6 percent a year import have double in the last 5 year our nation 's economic and political independence be become increasingly vulnerable unless profound change be make to lower oil consumption we now believe that early in the 1980 's the world will be demand more oil than it can produce
 the world now use about 60 million barrel of oil a day and demand increase each year about 5 percent this mean that just to stay even we need the production of a new texas every year an alaskan north slope every 9 month or a new saudi arabia every 3 year obviously this can not continue
 we must look back into history to understand our energy problem twice in the last several hundred year there have be a transition in the way people use energy
 the first be about 200 year ago when we change away from wood which have provide about 90 percent of all fuel to coal which be much more efficient this change become the basis of the industrial revolution
 the second change take place in this century with the grow use of oil and natural gas they be more convenient and cheap than coal and the supply seem to be almost without limit they make possible the age of automobile and airplane travel nearly everyone who be alive today grow up during this period and we have never know anything different
 because we be now run out of gas and oil we must prepare quickly for a third change to strict conservation and to the renew use of coal and to permanent renewable energy source like solar power
 the world have not prepare for the future during the 1950 's people use twice as much oil as during the 1940 's during the 1960 's we use twice as much as during the 1950 's and in each of those decade more oil be consume than in all of man 's previous history combine
 world consumption of oil be still go up if it be possible to keep it rise during the 1970 's and 1980 's by 5 percent a year as it have in the past we could use up all the proven reserve of oil in the entire world by the end of the next decade
 i know that many of you have suspect that some supply of oil and gas be be withhold from the market you may be right but suspicion about the oil company can not change the fact that we be run out of petroleum
 all of we have hear about the large oil field on alaska 's north slope in a few year when the north slope be produce fully its total output will be just about equal to 2 year increase in our own nation 's energy demand
 each new inventory of world oil reserve have be more disturbing than the last world oil production can probably keep go up for another 6 or 8 year but sometime in the 1980 's it can not go up any more demand will overtake production we have no choice about that
 but we do have a choice about how we will spend the next few year each american use the energy equivalent of 60 barrel of oil per person each year ours be the most wasteful nation on earth we waste more energy than we import with about the same standard of living we use twice as much energy per person as do other country like germany japan and sweden
 one choice of course be to continue do what we have be do before we can drift along for a few more year
 our consumption of oil would keep go up every year our car would continue to be too large and inefficient three quarter of they would carry only one person the driver while our public transportation system continue to decline we can delay insulate our home and they will continue to lose about 50 percent of their heat in waste we can continue use scarce oil and natural gas to generate electricity and continue waste two third of their fuel value in the process
 if we do not act then by 1985 we will be use 33 percent more energy than we use today
 we can not substantially increase our domestic production so we would need to import twice as much oil as we do now supply will be uncertain the cost will keep go up six year ago we pay $ 3.7 billion for import oil last year we spend $ 36 billion for import oil nearly 10 time as much and this year we may spend $ 45 billion
 unless we act we will spend more than $ 550 billion for import oil by 1985 more than $ 2,500 for every man woman and child in america along with that money that we transport overseas we will continue lose american job and become increasingly vulnerable to supply interruption
 now we have a choice but if we wait we will constantly live in fear of embargo we could endanger our freedom as a sovereign nation to act in foreign affair within 10 year we would not be able to import enough oil from any country at any acceptable price
 if we wait and do not act then our factory will not be able to keep our people on the job with reduced supply of fuel
 too few of our utility company will have switch to coal which be our most abundant energy source we will not be ready to keep our transportation system run with small and more efficient car and a well network of bus train and public transportation
 we will feel mount pressure to plunder the environment we will have to have a crash program to build more nuclear plant strip mine and bum more coal and drill more offshore well than if we begin to conserve right now
 inflation will soar production will go down people will lose their job intense competition for oil will build up among nation and also among the different region within our own country this have already start
 if we fail to act soon we will face an economic social and political crisis that will threaten our free institution but we still have another choice we can begin to prepare right now we can decide to act while there be still time that be the concept of the energy policy that we will present on wednesday
 our national energy plan be base on 10 fundamental principle the first principle be that we can have an effective and comprehensive energy policy only if the government take responsibility for it and if the people understand the seriousness of the challenge and be willing to make sacrifice
 the second principle be that healthy economic growth must continue only by save energy can we maintain our standard of living and keep our people at work an effective conservation program will create hundred of thousand of new job
 the third principle be that we must protect the environment our energy problem have the same cause as our environmental problem wasteful use of resource conservation help we solve both problem at once
 the fourth principle be that we must reduce our vulnerability to potentially devastating embargo we can protect ourselves from uncertain supply by reduce our demand for oil by make the most of our abundant resource such as coal and by develop a strategic petroleum reserve
 the fifth principle be that we must be fair our solution must ask equal sacrifice from every region every class of people and every interest group industry will have to do its part to conserve just as consumer will the energy producer deserve fair treatment but we will not let the oil company profiteer
 the sixth principle and the cornerstone of our policy be to reduce demand through conservation our emphasis on conservation be a clear difference between this plan and other which merely encourage crash production effort conservation be the quick cheap most practical source of energy conservation be the only way that we can buy a barrel of oil for about $ 2 it cost about $ 13 to waste it
 the seventh principle be that price should generally reflect the true replacement cost of energy we be only cheat ourselves if we make energy artificially cheap and use more than we can really afford
 the eighth principle be that government policy must be predictable and certain both consumer and producer need policy they can count on so they can plan ahead this be one reason that i be work with the congress to create a new department of energy to replace more than 50 different agency that now have some control over energy
 the ninth principle be that we must conserve the fuel that be scarcest and make the most of those that be plentiful we can not continue to use oil and gas for 75 percent of our consumption as we do now when they only make up 7 percent of our domestic reserve we need to shift to plentiful coal while take care to protect the environment and to apply strict safety standard to nuclear energy
 the tenth and last principle be that we must start now to develop the new unconventional source of energy that we will rely on in the next century
 now these 10 principle have guide the development of the policy that i will describe to you and the congress on wednesday night
 our energy plan will also include a number of specific goal to measure our progress toward a stable energy system these be the goal that we set for 1985
 to reduce the annual growth rate in our energy demand to less than 2 percent
 to reduce gasoline consumption by 10 percent below its current level
 to cut in half the portion of u.s. oil which be import from a potential level of 16 million barrel to 6 million barrel a day
 to establish a strategic petroleum reserve of one billion barrel more than a 6 month supply
 to increase our coal production by about two third to more than one billion ton a year
 to insulate 90 percent of american home and all new building
 to use solar energy in more than 2 1/2 million house
 we will monitor our progress toward these goal year by year our plan will call for strict conservation measure if we fall behind i can not tell you that these measure will be easy nor will they be popular but i think most of you realize that a policy which do not ask for change or sacrifice would not be an effective policy at this late date
 this plan be essential to protect our job our environment our standard of living and our future whether this plan truly make a difference will not be decide now here in washington but in every town and every factory in every home and on every highway and every farm
 i believe that this can be a positive challenge there be something especially american in the kind of change that we have to make we have always be proud through our history of be efficient people we have always be proud of our ingenuity our skill at answer question now we need efficiency and ingenuity more than ever
 we have always be proud of our leadership in the world and now we have a chance again to give the world a positive example
 we have always be proud of our vision of the future we have always want to give our child and our grandchild a world rich in possibility than we have have ourselves they be the one that we must provide for now they be the one who will suffer most if we do not act
 i have give you some of the principle of the plan i be sure that each of you will find something you do not like about the specific of our proposal it will demand that we make sacrifice and change in every life to some degree the sacrifice will be painful but so be any meaningful sacrifice it will lead to some high cost and to some great inconvenience for everyone but the sacrifice can be gradual realistic and they be necessary above all they will be fair no one will gain an unfair advantage through this plan no one will be ask to bear an unfair burden
 we will monitor the accuracy of datum from the oil and natural gas company for the first time so that we will always know their true production supply reserve and profit those citizen who insist on drive large unnecessarily powerful car must expect to pay more for that luxury
 we can be sure that all the special interest group in the country will attack the part of this plan that affect they directly they will say that sacrifice be fine as long as other people do it but that their sacrifice be unreasonable or unfair or harmful to the country if they succeed with this approach then the burden on the ordinary citizen who be not organize into an interest group would be crush
 there should be only one test for this program whether it will help our country other generation of americans have face and master great challenge i have faith that meet this challenge will make our own life even rich if you will join i so that we can work together with patriotism and courage we will again prove that our great nation can lead the world into an age of peace independence and freedom
 thank you very much and good night

to father hesburgh and the great faculty of notre dame to those who have be honor this afternoon with the degree from your great university to the graduate and undergraduate group who i understand be the large in the history of this great institution friend and parent

 thank you for that welcome i be very glad to be with you you may have start a new graduation trend which i do not deplore that is throw peanut on graduation day the more that be use or consume the high the price go

 i really do appreciate the great honor bestow upon i this afternoon my other degree be blue and gold from the navy and i want to let you know that i do feel a kinship with those who be assemble here this afternoon i be a little take aback by the comment that i have bring a new accent to the white house in the mind of many people in our country for the first time in almost 150 year there be no accent

 i try to think of a story that would illustrate two point simultaneously and also be brief which be kind of a difficult assignment i be sit on the truman balcony the other night with my good friend charles kirbo who tell i about a man who be arrest and take in to court for be drunk and for set a bed on fire when the judge ask he how he plead he say not guilty he say i be drunk but the bed be on fire when i get in it

 i think most of the graduate can draw the parallel between that statement and what you be approach after this graduation exercise but there be two point to that and i will come to the other one in just a few minute

 in his 25 year as president of notre dame father hesburgh have speak more consistently and more effectively in the support of the right of human being than any other person i know his interest in the notre dame center for civil rights have never waver and he play an important role in broaden the scope of the center 's work and i visit there last fall to see this work include now all people in the world as show by last month 's conference here on human right and american foreign policy

 and that concern have be demonstrate again today in a vivid fashion by the selection of bishop donal lamont paul cardinal arns and stephen cardinal kim to receive honorary degree in their fight for human freedom in rhodesia brazil and south korea these three religious leader typify all that be good in their country and in our church i be honor to join you in recognize their dedication their personal sacrifice and their supreme courage

 quite often brave man like these be castigate and sometimes punish sometimes even put to death because they enter the realm where human right be a struggle and sometimes they be blame for the very circumstance which they help to dramatize but it be be there for a long time and the flame which they seek to extinguish concern we all and be increasingly visible around the world

 last week i speak in california about the domestic agenda for our nation to provide more efficiently for the need of our people to demonstrate against the dark faith of our time that our government can be both competent and more humane

 but i want to speak to you today about the strand that connect our action overseas with our essential character as a nation i believe we can have a foreign policy that be democratic that be base on fundamental value and that use power and influence which we have for humane purpose we can also have a foreign policy that the american people both support and for a change know about and understand

 i have a quiet confidence in our own political system because we know that democracy work we can reject the argument of those ruler who deny human right to their people

 we be confident that democracy 's example will be compelling and so we seek to bring that example close to those from whom in the past few year we have be separate and who be not yet convince about the advantage of our kind of life

 we be confident that the democratic method be the most effective and so we be not tempt to employ improper tactic here at home or abroad

 we be confident of our own strength so we can seek substantial mutual reduction in the nuclear arm race

 and we be confident of the good sense of american people and so we let they share in the process of make foreign policy decision we can thus speak with the voice of 215 million and not just of an isolated handful

 democracy 's great recent success in india portugal spain greece show that our confidence in this system be not misplace be confident of our own future we be now free of that inordinate fear of communism which once lead we to embrace any dictator who join we in that fear i be glad that that be be change

 for too many year we have be willing to adopt the flawed and erroneous principle and tactic of our adversary sometimes abandon our own value for theirs we have fight fire with fire never think that fire be well quench with water this approach fail with vietnam the good example of its intellectual and moral poverty but through failure we have now find our way back to our own principle and value and we have regain our lose confidence

 by the measure of history our nation 's 200 year be very brief and our rise to world eminence be brief still it date from 1945 when europe and the old international order lie in ruin before then .america be largely on the periphery of world affair but since then we have inescapably be at the center of world affair

 our policy during this period be guide by two principle a belief that soviet expansion be almost inevitable but that it must be contain and the corresponding belief in the importance of an almost exclusive alliance among non communist nation on both side of the atlantic that system could not last forever unchanged historical trend have weaken its foundation the unifying threat of conflict with the soviet union have become less intensive even though the competition have become more extensive

 the vietnamese war produce a profound moral crisis sap worldwide faith in our own policy and our system of life a crisis of confidence make even more grave by the covert pessimism of some of our leader

 in less than a generation we have see the world change dramatically the daily life and aspiration of most human being have be transform colonialism be nearly go a new sense of national identity now exist in almost 100 new country that have be form in the last generation knowledge have become more widespread aspiration be high as more people have be free from traditional constraint more have be determine to achieve for the first time in their life social justice

 the world be still divide by ideological dispute dominate by regional conflict and threaten by danger that we will not resolve the difference of race and wealth without violence or without draw into combat the major military power we can no long separate the traditional issue of war and peace from the new global question of justice equity and human right

 it be a new world but america should not fear it it be a new world and we should help to shape it it be a new world that call for a new american foreign policy a policy base on constant decency in its value and on optimism in our historical vision

 we can no long have a policy solely for the industrial nation as the foundation of global stability but we must respond to the new reality of a politically awakening world

 we can no long expect that the other 150 nation will follow the dictate of the powerful but we must continue confidently our effort to inspire to persuade and to lead

 our policy must reflect our belief that the world can hope for more than simple survival and our belief that dignity and freedom be fundamental spiritual requirement our policy must shape an international system that will last long than secret deal

 we can not make this kind of policy by manipulation our policy must be open it must be candid it must be one of constructive global involvement rest on five cardinal principle

 i have try to make these premise clear to the american people since last january let i review what we have be do and discuss what we intend to do

 first we have reaffirm america 's commitment to human right as a fundamental tenet of our foreign policy in ancestry religion color place of origin and cultural background we americans be as diverse a nation as the world have even see no common mystique of blood or soil unite we what draw we together perhaps more than anything else be a belief in human freedom we want the world to know that our nation stand for more than financial prosperity

 this do not mean that we can conduct our foreign policy by rigid moral maxim we live in a world that be imperfect and which will always be imperfect a world that be complex and confused and which will always be complex and confused

 i understand fully the limit of moral suasion we have no illusion that change will come easily or soon but i also believe that it be a mistake to undervalue the power of word and of the idea that word embody in our own history that power have range from thomas paine 's common sense to martin luther king jr. 's i have a dream

 in the life of the human spirit word be action much more so than many of we may realize who live in country where freedom of expression be take for grant the leader of totalitarian nation understand this very well the proof be that word be precisely the action for which dissident in those country be be persecute

 nonetheless we can already see dramatic worldwide advance in the protection of the individual from the arbitrary power of the state for we to ignore this trend would be to lose influence and moral authority in the world to lead it will be to regain the moral stature that we once have

 the great democracy be not free because we be strong and prosperous i believe we be strong and influential and prosperous because we be free

 throughout the world today in free nation and in totalitarian country as well there be a preoccupation with the subject of human freedom human right and i believe it be incumbent on we in this country to keep that discussion that debate that contention alive no other country be as well qualified as we to set an example we have our own shortcoming and fault and we should strive constantly and with courage to make sure that we be legitimately proud of what we have

 second we have move deliberately to reinforce the bond among our democracy in our recent meeting in london we agree to widen our economic cooperation to promote free trade to strengthen the world 's monetary system to seek way of avoid nuclear proliferation we prepare constructive proposal for the forthcoming meeting on north south problem of poverty development and global well being and we agree on joint effort to reinforce and to modernize our common defense

 you may be interested in know that at this nato meeting for the first time in more than 25 year all member be democracy even more important all of we reaffirm our basic optimism in the future of the democratic system our spirit of confidence be spread together our democracy can help to shape the wide architecture of global cooperation

 third we have move to engage the soviet union in a joint effort to halt the strategic arm race this race be not only dangerous it be morally deplorable we must put an end to it

 i know it will not be easy to reach agreement our goal be to be fair to both side to produce reciprocal stability parity and security we desire a freeze on further modernization and production of weapon and a continue substantial reduction of strategic nuclear weapon as well we want a comprehensive ban on all nuclear testing a prohibition against all chemical warfare no attack capability against space satellite and arm limitation in the indian ocean

 we hope that we can take joint step with all nation toward a final agreement eliminate nuclear weapon completely from our arsenal of death we will persist in this effort

 now i believe in detente with the soviet union to i it mean progress toward peace but the effect of detente should not be limit to our own two country alone we hope to persuade the soviet union that one country can not impose its system of society upon another either through direct military intervention or through the use of a client state 's military force as be the case with cuban intervention in angola

 cooperation also imply obligation we hope that the soviet union will join with we and other nation in play a large role in aid the develop world for common aid effort will help we build a bridge of mutual confidence in one another

 fourth we be take deliberate step to improve the chance of last peace in the middle east through wide range consultation with leader of the country involve israel syria jordan and egypt we have find some area of agreement and some movement toward consensus the negotiation must continue

 through my own public comment i have also try to suggest a more flexible framework for the discussion of the three key issue which have so far be so intractable the nature of a comprehensive peace what be peace what do it mean to the israelis what do it mean to their arab neighbor secondly the relationship between security and border how can the dispute over border delineation be establish and settle with a feeling of security on both side and the issue of the palestinian homeland

 the historic friendship that the united states have with israel be not dependent on domestic politic in either nation it be derive from our common respect for human freedom and from a common search for permanent peace

 we will continue to promote a settlement which all of we need our own policy will not be affect by change in leadership in any of the country in the middle east therefore we expect israel and her neighbor to continue to be bind by united nations resolutions 242 and 338 which they have previously accept

 this may be the most propitious time for a genuine settlement since the beginning of the arab israeli conflict almost 30 year ago to let this opportunity pass could mean disaster not only for the middle east but perhaps for the international political and economic order as well

 and fifth we be attempt even at the risk of some friction with our friend to reduce the danger of nuclear proliferation and the worldwide spread of conventional weapon

 at the recent summit we set in motion an international effort to determine the good way of harness nuclear energy for peaceful use while reduce the risk that its product will be divert to the making of explosive

 we have already complete a comprehensive review of our own policy on arm transfer competition in arm sale be inimical to peace and destructive of the economic development of the poor country

 we will as a matter of national policy now in our country seek to reduce the annual dollar volume of arm sale to restrict the transfer of advanced weapon and to reduce the extent of our coproduction arrangement about weapon with foreign state and just as important we be try to get other nation both free and otherwise to join we in this effort

 but all of this that i have describe be just the beginning it be a beginning aim towards a clear goal to create a wide framework of international cooperation suit to the new and rapidly change historical circumstance

 we will cooperate more closely with the newly influential country in latin america africa and asia we need their friendship and cooperation in a common effort as the structure of world power change

 more than 100 year ago abraham lincoln say that our nation could not exist half slave and half free we know a peaceful world can not long exist one third rich and two third hungry

 most nation share our faith that in the long run expand and equitable trade will well help the develop country to help themselves but the immediate problem of hunger disease illiteracy and repression be here now

 the western democracy the opec nation and the develop communist country can cooperate through exist international institution in provide more effective aid this be an excellent alternative to war

good evening
 more than six month ago in april i speak to you about a need for a national policy to deal with our present and future energy problem and the next day i send my proposal to the congress
 the congress have recognize the urgency of this problem and have come to grip with some of the most complex and difficult decision that a legislative body have ever be ask to make
 work with congress we have now form a new department of energy head by secretary james schlesinger we have the ability to administer the new energy legislation and congressional work on the national energy plan have now reach the final stage
 last week the senate send its version of the legislation to the conference committee where member of the house and senate will now resolve difference between the bill that they have pass there in the next few week the strength and courage of our political system will be prove
 the choice face the member of congress be not easy for they to pass an effective and fair plan they will need your support and your understanding your support to resist pressure from a few for special favor at the expense of the rest of we and your understanding that there can be no effective plan without some sacrifice from all of we
 tonight at this crucial time i want to emphasize why it be so important that we have an energy plan and what we will risk as a nation if we be timid or reluctant to face this challenge it be crucial that you understand how serious this challenge be
 with every pass month our energy problem have grow bad this summer we use more oil and gasoline than ever before in our history more of our oil be come from foreign country just since april our oil import have cost we $ 23 billion about $ 350 worth of foreign oil for the average american family
 a few week ago in detroit an unemployed steelworker tell i something that may reflect the feeling of many of you mr. president he say i do not feel much like talk about energy and foreign policy i be concerned about how i be go to live i can not be too concerned about other thing when i have a 10 year old daughter to raise and i do not have a job and i be 56 year old
 well i understand how he feel but i must tell you the truth and the truth be that you can not talk about economic problem now or in the future without talk about energy
 let i try to describe the size and the effect of the problem our farmer be the great agricultural exporter the world have ever know but it now take all the food and fiber that we export in 2 year just to pay for 1 year of import oil about $ 45 billion
 this excessive importing of foreign oil be a tremendous and rapidly increase drain on our national economy it hurt every american family it cause unemployment every $ 5 billion increase in oil import cost we 200,000 american job it cost we business investment vast amount of american wealth no long stay in the united states to build our factory and to give we a well life
 it make it hard for we to balance our federal budget and to finance need program for our people it unbalance our nation 's trade with other country this year primarily because of oil our import will be at least $ 25 billion more than all the american good the we sell overseas
 it push up international energy price because excessive importing of oil by the united states make it easy for foreign producer to raise their price it feed serious inflationary pressure in our own economy
 if this trend continue the excessive reliance on foreign oil could make the very security of our nation increasingly dependent on uncertain energy supply our national security depend on more than just our armed forces it also rest on the strength of our economy on our national will and on the ability of the united states to carry out our foreign policy as a free and independent nation america overseas be only as strong as america at home
 the secretary of defense say recently the present deficiency of assured energy source be the single sure threat to our security and to that of our ally
 yesterday after careful consideration i announce the postponement of a major overseas trip until after christmas because of the paramount importance of develop an effective energy plan this year i have no doubt that this be the right decision because the other nation of the world ally and adversary alike await our energy decision with a great interest and concern
 as one of the world 's large producer of coal and oil and gas why do we have this problem with energy and why be it so difficult to solve
 one problem be that the price of all energy be go up both because of its increase scarcity and because the price of oil be not set in a free and competitive market the world price be set by a foreign cartel the government of the so call opec nation that price be now almost five time as great as it be in 1973
 our big problem however be that we simply use too much and waste too much energy our import have more than triple in the last 10 year although all country could of course be more efficient we be the bad offender since the great price rise in 1973 the japanese have cut their oil import the germans the french the british the italians have all cut their oil import meanwhile although we have large petroleum supply of our own and most of they do not we in the united states have increase our import more than 40 percent
 this problem have come upon we suddenly ten year ago when foreign oil be cheap we import just 2 1/2 million barrel of oil a day about 20 percent of what we use by 1972 we be import about 30 percent this year when foreign oil be very expensive we be import nearly 9 million barrel a day almost one half of all the oil we use unless we act quickly import will continue to go up and all the problem that i have just describe will grow even bad
 there be three thing that we must do to avoid this danger first cut back on consumption second shift away from oil and gas to other source of energy and third encourage production of energy here in the united states these be the purpose of the new energy legislation
 in order to conserve energy the congress be now act to make our automobile our home and appliance more efficient and to encourage industry to save both heat and electricity
 the congressional conference committee be now consider change in how electric power rate be set in order to discourage waste to reward those who use less energy and to encourage a change in the use of electricity to hour of the day when demand be low
 another very important question before congress be how to let the market price for domestic oil go up to reflect the cost of replace it while at the same time protect the american consumer and our own economy
 we must face an unpleasant fact about energy price they be go up whether we pass an energy program or not as fuel become more scarce and more expensive to produce the question be who should benefit from those rise price for oil already discover our energy plan capture and return they to the public where they can stimulate the economy save more energy and create new job
 we will use research and development project tax incentive and penalty and regulatory authority to hasten the shift from oil and gas to coal to wind and solar power to geothermal methane and other energy source
 we have also propose and the congress be review incentive to encourage production of oil and gas here in our own country this be where another major controversy arise
 it be important that we promote new oil and gas discovery and increase production by give adequate price to the producer
 we have recommend that the price for instance of new natural gas be raise each year to the average price of domestic oil that would produce the same amount of energy with this new policy the gross income of gas producer would average about $ 2 billion each year more than at the present price level new oil price would also rise in 3 year to the present world level and then be increase annually to keep up with inflation this incentive for new oil production would be the high in the whole world
 these proposal would provide adequate incentive for exploration and production of domestic oil and gas but some of the oil company want much more ten of billion of dollar more they want greatly increase price for old oil and gas energy supply which have already be discover and which be be produce now they want immediate and permanent deregulation of gas price which would cost consumer $ 70 billion or more between now and 1985 they want even high price than those we have propose for new gas and oil and they want the high price soon they want low taxis on their profit
 these be all controversial question and the congressional debate as you can well imagine be intense the political pressure be great because the stake be so high billion and billion of dollar we should reward individual and company who discover and produce new oil and gas but we must not give they huge windfall profit on their exist well at the expense of the american people
 now the energy proposal that i make to congress last april have three basic element to ensure that it be well balanced first it be fair both to the american consumer and to the energy producer and it will not disrupt our national economy second as i have say before it be design to meet our important goal for energy conservation to promote a shift to more plentiful and permanent energy supply and encourage increase production of energy in the united states and third it protect our federal budget from any unreasonable burden these be the three standard by which the final legislation must be judge i will sign the energy bill only if they meet these test
 during the next few week the congress will make a judgment on these vital question i will be work closely with they and you be also deeply involved in these decision this be not a contest of strength between the president and the congress nor between the house and the senate what be be measure be the strength and will of our nation whether we can acknowledge a threat and meet a serious challenge together
 i be convinced that we can have enough energy to permit the continued growth of our economy to expand production and job and to protect the security of the united states if we act wisely
 i believe that this country can meet any challenge but this be an exceptionally difficult one because the threat be not easy to see and the solution be neither simple nor politically popular
 i say 6 month ago that no one would be completely satisfied with this national energy plan unfortunately that prediction have turn out to be right there be some part of this complex legislation to which every region and every interest group can object but a common national sacrifice to meet this serious problem should be share by everyone some proof that the plan be fair many group have rise to the challenge but unfortunately there be still some who seek personal gain over the national interest
 it be also especially difficult to deal with long range future challenge a president be elect for just 4 year a senator for 6 and our representatives in congress for only 2 year it be always be easy to wait until the next year or the next term of office to avoid political risk but you do not choose your elect official simply to fill an office the congress be face very difficult decision courageously and we have form a good partnership all of we in government need your help
 this be an effort which require vision and cooperation from all americans i hope that each of you will take step to conserve our precious energy and also join with your elect official at all level of government to meet this test of our nation 's judgment and will
 these be serious problem and this have be a serious talk but our energy plan also reflect the optimism that i feel about our ability to deal with these problem the story of the human race be one of adapt to change circumstance the history of our nation be one of meeting challenge and overcome they
 this major legislation be a necessary first step on a long and difficult road this energy plan be a good insurance policy for the future in which relatively small premium that we pay today will protect we in the year ahead but if we fail to act boldly today then we will surely face a great series of crisis tomorrow energy shortage environmental damage ever more massive government bureaucracy and regulation and illconsidere last minute crash program
 i hope that perhaps a hundred year from now the change to inexhaustible energy source will have be make and our nation 's concern about energy will be over but we can make that transition smoothly for our country and for our child and for our grandchild only if we take careful step now to prepare ourselves for the future
 during the next few week attention will be focus on the congress but the proving of our courage and commitment will continue in different form and place in the month and the year even generation ahead
 it be fitting that i be speak to you on an election day a day which remind we that you the people be the ruler of this nation that your government will be as courageous and effective and fair as you demand
 that it be
 this will not be the last time that i as president present difficult and controversial choice to you and ask for your help i believe that the duty of this office permit i to do no less but i be confident that we can find the wisdom and the courage to make the right decision even when they be unpleasant so that we might together preserve the greatness of our nation
 thank you very much

mr. president mr. speaker member of the 95th congress lady and gentleman

 two year ago today we have the first caucus in iowa and one year ago tomorrow i walk from here to the white house to take up the duty of president of the united states i do not know it then when i walk but i have be try to save energy ever since

 i return tonight to fulfill one of those duty of the constitution to give to the congress and to the nation information on the state of the union

 militarily politically economically and in spirit the state of our union be sound

 we be a great country a strong country a vital and a dynamic country and so we will remain

 we be a confident people and a hardworke people a decent and a compassionate people and so we will remain

 i want to speak to you tonight about where we be and where we must go about what we have do and what we must do and i want to pledge to you my good effort and ask you to pledge your

 each generation of americans have to face circumstance not of its own choosing but by which its character be measure and its spirit be test

 there be time of emergency when a nation and its leader must bring their energy to bear on a single urgent task that be the duty abraham lincoln face when our land be tear apart by conflict in the war between the states that be the duty face by franklin roosevelt when he lead america out of an economic depression and again when he lead america to victory in war

 there be other time when there be no single overwhelming crisis yet profound national interest be at stake

 at such time the risk of inaction can be equally great it become the task of leader to call forth the vast and restless energy of our people to build for the future

 that be what harry truman do in the year after the second world war when we help europe and japan rebuild themselves and secure an international order that have protect freedom from aggression

 we live in such time now and we face such duty

 we have come through a long period of turmoil and doubt but we have once again find our moral course and with a new spirit we be strive to express our good instinct to the rest of the world

 there be all across our land a grow sense of peace and a sense of common purpose this sense of unity can not be express in program or in legislation or in dollar it be an achievement that belong to every individual american this unity tie together and it tower over all our effort here in washington and it serve as an inspire beacon for all of we who be elect to serve

 this new atmosphere demand a new spirit a partnership between those of we who lead and those who elect the foundation of this partnership be truth the courage to face hard decision concern for one another and the common good over special interest and a basic faith and trust in the wisdom and strength and judgment of the american people

 for the first time in a generation we be not haunt by a major international crisis or by domestic turmoil and we now have a rare and a priceless opportunity to address persistent problem and burden which come to we as a nation quietly and steadily get bad over the year

 as president i have have to ask you the member of congress and you the american people to come to grip with some of the most difficult and hard question face our society

 we must make a maximum effort because if we do not aim for the good we be very likely to achieve little i see no benefit to the country if we delay because the problem will only get bad

 we need patience and good will but we really need to realize that there be a limit to the role and the function of government government can not solve our problem it can not set our goal it can not define our vision government can not eliminate poverty or provide a bountiful economy or reduce inflation or save our city or cure illiteracy or provide energy and government can not mandate goodness only a true partnership between government and the people can ever hope to reach these goal

 those of we who govern can sometimes inspire and we can identify need and marshal resource but we simply can not be the manager of everything and everybody

 we here in washington must move away from crisis management and we must establish clear goal for the future immediate and the distant future which will let we work together and not in conflict never again should we neglect a grow crisis like the shortage of energy where further delay will only lead to more harsh and painful solution

 every day we spend more than $ 120 million for foreign oil this slow our economic growth it lower the value of the dollar overseas and it aggravate unemployment and inflation here at home

 now we know what we must do increase production we must cut down on waste and we must use more of those fuel which be plentiful and more permanent we must be fair to people and we must not disrupt our nation 's economy and our budget

 now that sound simple but i recognize the difficulty involve i know that it be not easy for the congress to act but the fact remain that on the energy legislation we have fail the american people almost five year after the oil embargo dramatize the problem for we all we still do not have a national energy program not much long can we tolerate this stalemate it undermine our national interest both at home and abroad we must succeed and i believe we will

 our main task at home this year with energy a central element be the nation 's economy we must continue the recovery and far cut unemployment and inflation

 last year be a good one for the united states we reach all of our major economic goal for 1977 four million new job be create an all time record and the number of unemployed drop by more than a million unemployment right now be the low it have be since 1974 and not since world war ii have such a high percentage of american people be employ

 the rate of inflation go down there be a good growth in business profit and investment the source of more job for our worker and a high standard of live for all our people after taxis and inflation there be a healthy increase in worker wage

 and this year our country will have the first $ 2 trillion economy in the history of the world

 now we be proud of this progress the first year but we must do even well in the future

 we still have serious problem on which all of we must work together our trade deficit be too large inflation be still too high and too many americans still do not have a job

 now i do not have any simple answer for all these problem but we have develop an economic policy that be work because it be simple balanced and fair it be base on four principle

 first the economy must keep on expand to produce new job and well income which our people need the fruit of growth must be widely share more job must be make available to those who have be bypass until now and the tax system must be make fair and simple

 secondly private business and not the government must lead the expansion in the future

 third we must lower the rate of inflation and keep it down inflation slow down economic growth and it be the most cruel to the poor and also to the elderly and other who live on fix income

 and fourth we must contribute to the strength of the world economy

 i will announce detailed proposal for improve our tax system later this week we can make our tax law fair we can make they simple and easy to understand and at the same time we can and we will reduce the tax burden on american citizen by $ 25 billion

 the tax reform and the tax reduction go together only with the long overdue reform will the full tax cut be advisable

 almost $ 17 billion in income tax cut will go to individual ninety six percent of all american taxpayer will see their taxis go down for a typical family of four this mean an annual saving of more than $ 250 a year or a tax reduction of about 20 percent a further $ 2 billion cut in excise taxis will give more relief and also contribute directly to lower the rate of inflation

 and we will also provide strong additional incentive for business investment and growth through substantial cut in the corporate tax rate and improvement in the investment tax credit

 now these tax proposal will increase opportunity everywhere in the nation but additional job for the disadvantaged deserve special attention

 we have already pass law to assure equal access to the voting booth and to restaurant and to school to housing and law to permit access to job but job opportunity the chance to earn a decent living be also a basic human right which we can not and will not ignore

 a major priority for our nation be the final elimination of the barrier that restrict the opportunity available to woman and also to black people and hispanics and other minority we have come a long way toward that goal but there be still much to do what we inherit from the past must not be permit to shackle we in the future

 i will be ask you for a substantial increase in fund for public job for our young people and i also be recommend that the congress continue the public service employment program at more than twice the level of a year ago when welfare reform be complete we will have more than a million additional job so that those on welfare who be able to work can work

 however again we know that in our free society private business be still the good source of new job therefore i will propose a new program to encourage business to hire young and disadvantaged americans these young people only need skill and a chance in order to take their place in our economic system let us give they the chance they need a major step in the right direction would be the early passage of a greatly improve humphrey hawkins bill

 my budget for 1979 address these national need but it be lean and tight i have cut waste wherever possible

 i be propose an increase of less than 2 percent after adjust for inflation the small increase in the federal budget in four year

 lately federal spending have take a steadily increase portion of what americans produce our new budget reverse that trend and later i hope to bring the government 's toll down even far and with your help we will do that

 in time of high employment and a strong economy deficit spending should not be a feature of our budget as the economy continue to gain strength and as our unemployment rate continue to fall revenue will grow with careful planning efficient management and proper restraint on spending we can move rapidly toward a balanced budget and we will

 next year the budget deficit will be only slightly less than this year but one third of the deficit be due to the necessary tax cut that i have propose this year the right choice be to reduce the burden on taxpayer and provide more job for our people

 the third element in our program be a renew attack on inflation we have learn the hard way that high unemployment will not prevent or cure inflation government can help we by stimulate private investment and by maintain a responsible economic policy through a new top level review process we will do a well job of reduce government regulation that drive up cost and drive up price

 but again government alone can not bring down the rate of inflation when a level of high inflation be expect to continue then company raise price to protect their profit margin against prospective increase in wage and other cost while worker demand high wage as protection against expect price increase it be like an escalation in the arm race and understandably no one want to disarm alone

 now no one firm or a group of worker can halt this process it be an effort that we must all make together i be therefore ask government business labor and other group to join in a voluntary program to moderate inflation by hold wage and price increase in each sector of the economy during 1978 below the average increase of the last two year

 i do not believe in wage and price control a sincere commitment to voluntary constraint provide a way perhaps the only way to fight inflation without government interference

 as i come into the capitol tonight i see the farmer my fellow farmer stand out in the snow i be familiar with their problem and i know from congress action that you be too when i be run carters warehouse we have spread on our own farm 5 10 15 fertilizer for about $ 40 a ton the last time i be home the price be about $ 100 a ton the cost of nitrogen have go up 150 percent and the price of product that farmer sell have either stay the same or go down a little

 now this past year in 1977 you the congress and i together pass a new agricultural act it go into effect october 1 it will have its first impact on the 1978 crop it will help a great deal it will add $ 6.5 billion or more to help the farmer with their price support and target price

 last year we have the high level of export of farm product in the history of our country—$24 billion we expect to have more this year we will be work together but i think it be incumbent on we to monitor very carefully the farm situation and continue to work harmoniously with the farmer of our country what be good for the farmer the farm family in the long run be also good for the consumer of our country

 economic success at home be also the key to success in our international economic policy an effective energy program strong investment and productivity and control inflation will provide improve our trade balance and balance it and it will help to protect the integrity of the dollar overseas

 by work closely with our friend abroad we can promote the economic health of the whole world with fair and balanced agreement lower the barrier to trade

 despite the inevitable pressure that build up when the world economy suffer from high unemployment we must firmly resist the demand for self defeat protectionism but free trade must also be fair trade and i be determined to protect american industry and american worker against foreign trade practice which be unfair or illegal

 in a separate write message to congress i have outline other domestic initiative such as welfare reform consumer protection basic education skill urban policy reform of our labor law and national health care later on this year i will not repeat these tonight but there be several other point that i would like to make directly to you

 during these past year americans have see our government grow far from we

 for some citizen the government have almost become like a foreign country so strange and distant that we have often have to deal with it through train ambassador who have sometimes become too powerful and too influential lawyer accountant and lobbyist this can not go on


 we must have what abraham lincoln want a government for the people

 we have make progress toward that kind of government you have give i the authority i request to reorganize the federal bureaucracy and i be use that authority

 we have already begin a series of reorganization plan which will be complete over a period of three year we have also propose abolish almost 500 federal advisory and other commission and board but i know that the american people be still sick and tired of federal paperwork and redtape bit by bit we be chop down the thicket of unnecessary federal regulation by which government too often interfere in our personal life and our personal business we have cut the public 's federal paperwork load by more than 12 percent in less than a year and we be not through cut

 we have make a good start on turn the gobbledygook of federal regulation into plain english that people can understand but we know that we still have a long way to go

 we have bring together part of 11 government agency to create a new department of energy and now it be time to take another major step by create a separate department of education

 but even the well organized government will only be as effective as the people who carry out its policy for this reason i consider civil service reform to be absolutely vital work out with the civil servant themselves this reorganization plan will restore the merit principle to a system which have grow into a bureaucratic maze it will provide great management flexibility and well reward for well performance without compromise job security

 then and only then can we have a government that be efficient open and truly worthy of our people 's understanding and respect i have promise that we will have such a government and i intend to keep that promise

 in our foreign policy the separation of people from government have be in the past a source of weakness and error in a democratic system like ours foreign policy decision must be able to stand the test of public examination and public debate if we make a mistake in this administration it will be on the side of frankness and openness with the american people

 in our modern world when the death of literally million of people can result from a few terrifying second of destruction the path of national strength and security be identical to the path of peace

 tonight i be happy to report that because we be strong our nation be at peace with the world

 we be a confident nation we have restore a moral basis for our foreign policy the very heart of our identity as a nation be our firm commitment to human right

 we stand for human right because we believe that government have as a purpose to promote the well being of its citizen this be true in our domestic policy it be also true in our foreign policy the world must know that in support of human right the united states will stand firm

 we expect no quick or easy result but there have be significant movement toward great freedom and humanity in several part of the world

 thousand of political prisoner have be free the leader of the world even our ideological adversary now see that their attitude toward fundamental human right affect their standing in the international community and it affect their relation with the united states

 to serve the interest of every american our foreign policy have three major goal

 the first and prime concern be and will remain the security of our country

 security be base on our national will and security be base on the strength of our armed force we have the will and militarily we be very strong

 security also come through the strength of our alliance we have reconfirm our commitment to the defense of europe and this year we will demonstrate that commitment by further modernizing and strengthen our military capability there

 security can also be enhance by agreement with potential adversary which reduce the threat of nuclear disaster while maintain our own relative strategic capability

 in area of peaceful competition with the soviet union we will continue to more than hold our own

 at the same time we be negotiate with quiet confidence without haste with careful determination to ease the tension between we and to ensure great stability and security

 the strategic arm limitation talk have be long and difficult we want a mutual limit on both the quality and the quantity of the giant nuclear arsenal of both nation and then we want actual reduction in strategic arm as a major step toward the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapon from the face of the earth

 if these talk result in an agreement this year and i trust they will i pledge to you that the agreement will maintain and enhance the stability of the world 's strategic balance and the security of the united states

 for 30 year concert but unsuccessful effort have be make to ban the testing of atomic explosive both military weapon and peaceful nuclear device

 we be hard at work with great britain and the soviet union on an agreement which will stop test and will protect our national security and provide for adequate verification of compliance we be now make i believe good progress toward this comprehensive ban on nuclear explosion

 we be also work vigorously to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapon among the nation of the world which do not now have they and to reduce the deadly global traffic in conventional arm sale our stand for peace be suspect if we be also the principal arm merchant of the world so we have decide to cut down our arm transfer abroad on a year by year basis and to work with other major arm exporter to encourage their similar constraint

 every american have a stake in our second major goal a world at peace in a nuclear age each of we be threaten when peace be not secure everywhere we be try to promote harmony in those part of the world where major difference exist among other nation and threaten international peace

 in the middle east we be contribute our good office to maintain the momentum of the current negotiation and to keep open the line of communication among the middle eastern leader the whole world have a great stake in the success of these effort this be a precious opportunity for a historic settlement of a longstanding conflict an opportunity which may never come again in our lifetime

 our role have be difficult and sometimes thankless and controversial but it have be constructive and it have be necessary and it will continue

 our third major foreign policy goal be one that touch the life of every american citizen every day world economic growth and stability

 this require strong economic performance by the industrialize democracy like ourselves and progress in resolve the global energy crisis last fall with the help of other we succeed in our vigorous effort to maintain the stability of the price of oil but as many foreign leader have emphasize to i personally and i be sure to you the great future contribution that america can make to the world economy would be an effective energy conservation program here at home we will not hesitate to take the action need to protect the integrity of the american dollar

 we be try to develop a more just international system and in this spirit we be support the struggle for human development in africa in asia and in latin america

 finally the world be watch to see how we act on one of our most important and controversial item of business approval of the panama canal treaty the treaty now before the senate be the result of the work of four administration two democratic two republican

 they guarantee that the canal will be open always for unrestricted use by the ship of the world our ship have the right to go to the head of the line for priority of passage in time of emergency or need we retain the permanent right to defend the canal with our own military force if necessary to guarantee its openness and its neutrality

 the treaty be to the clear advantage of ourselves the panamanians and the other user of the canal ratify the panama canal treaty will demonstrate our good faith to the world discourage the spread of hostile ideology in this hemisphere and directly contribute to the economic well being and the security of the united states

 i have to say that that be very welcome applause laughter

 there be two moment on my recent journey which for i confirm the final aim of our foreign policy and what it always must be

 one be in a little village in india where i meet a people as passionately attach to their right and liberty as we be but whose child have a far small chance for good health or food or education or human fulfillment than a child bear in this country

 the other moment be in warsaw capital of a nation twice devastate by war in this century there people have rebuild the city which war 's destruction take from they but what be new only emphasize clearly what be lose

 what i see in those two place crystalize for i the purpose of our own nation 's policy to ensure economic justice to advance human right to resolve conflict without violence and to proclaim in our great democracy our constant faith in the liberty and dignity of human being everywhere

 we americans have a great deal of work to do together in the end how well we do that work will depend on the spirit in which we approach it we must seek fresh answer unhindered by the stale prescription of the past

 it have be say that our good year be behind we but i say again that america 's good be still ahead we have emerge from bitter experience chasten but proud confident once again ready to face challenge once again and unite once again

 we come together tonight at a solemn time last week the senate lose a good and honest man lee metcalf of montana

 and today the flag of the united states fly at half mast from this capitol and from american installation and ship all over the world in mourn for senator hubert humphrey

 because he exemplify so well the joy and the zest of living his death remind we not so much of our own mortality but of the possibility offer to we by life he always look to the future with a special american kind of confidence of hope and enthusiasm and the good way that we can honor he be by follow his example

 our task to use the word of senator humphrey be reconciliation rebuilding and rebirth

 reconciliation of private need and interest into a high purpose

 rebuild the old dream of justice and liberty and country and community

 rebirth of our faith in the common good

 each of we here tonight and all who be listen in your home must rededicate ourselves to serve the common good we be a community a beloved community all of we our individual fate be link our future intertwine and if we act in that knowledge and in that spirit together as the bible say we can move mountain

good evening

 i want to have a frank talk with you tonight about our most serious domestic problem that problem be inflation inflation can threaten all the economic gain we have make and it can stand in the way of what we want to achieve in the future

 this have be a long time threat for the last 10 year the annual inflation rate in the united states have average 6 1/2 percent and during the 3 year before my inauguration it have increase to an average of 8 percent

 inflation have therefore be a serious problem for i ever since i become president we have try to control it but we have not be successful it be time for all of we to make a great and a more coordinated effort

 if inflation get bad several thing will happen your purchasing power will continue to decline and most of the burden will fall on those who can least afford it our national productivity will suffer the value of our dollar will continue to fall in world trade

 we have make good progress in put our people back to work over the past 21 month we have create more than 6 million new job for american worker we have reduce the unemployment rate by about 25 percent and we will continue our effort to reduce unemployment far especially among our young people and minority

 but i must tell you tonight that inflation threaten this progress if we do not get inflation under control we will not be able to reduce unemployment far and we may even slide backward

 inflation be obviously a serious problem what be the solution

 i do not have all the answer nobody do perhaps there be no complete and adequate answer but i want to let you know that fight inflation will be a central preoccupation of mine during the month ahead and i want to arouse our nation to join i in this effort

 there be two simplistic and familiar answer which be sometimes propose simple familiar and too extreme one of these answer be to impose a complicated scheme of federal government wage and price control on our entire free economic system the other be a deliberate recession which would throw million of people out of work both of these extreme proposal would not work and they must be reject

 i have spend many hour in the last few month review with my own adviser and with a number of outside expert every proposal every suggestion every possibility for eliminate inflation if there be one thing i have learn beyond any doubt it be that there be no single solution for inflation

 what we have instead be a number of partial remedy some of they will help other may not but we have no choice but to use the good approach we have and to maintain a constant search for additional step which may be effective

 i want to discuss with you tonight some of the approach we have be able to develop they involve action by government business labor and every other sector of our economy some of these factor be under my control as president especially government action and i will insist that the government do its part of the job

 but whether our effort be successful will finally depend on you as much as on i your decision make every day at your service station or your grocery store in your business in your union meeting will determine our nation 's answer to inflation as much as decision make here in the white house or by the congress on capitol hill

 i can not guarantee that our joint effort will succeed in fact it be almost certain not to succeed if success mean quick or dramatic change every free government on earth be wrestle with this problem of inflation and every one of they know that a long term disease require longterm treatment it be up to we to make the improvement we can even at the risk of partial failure rather than to ensure failure by not try at all

 i will concentrate my effort within the government we know that government be not the only cause of inflation but it be one of the cause and government do set an example therefore it must take the lead in fiscal restraint

 we be go to hold down government spending reduce the budget deficit and eliminate government waste

 we will slash federal hiring and cut the federal work force we will eliminate needless regulation we will bring more competition back to our economy

 and we will oppose any further reduction in federal income taxis until we have convincing prospect that inflation will be control

 let i explain what each one of these step mean

 the federal deficit be too high our people be simply sick and tired of wasteful federal spending and the inflation it bring with it

 we have already have some success we have bring the deficit down by one third since i run for president from more than $ 66 billion in fiscal year 1976 to about $ 40 billion in fiscal year 1979 a reduction of more than $ 25 billion in the federal deficit in just 3 year

 it will keep go down next year with tough restraint on federal spending and moderate economic growth in prospect i plan to reduce the budget deficit to less than one half what it be when i run for office to $ 30 billion or less

 the government have be spend too great a portion of what our nation produce during my campaign i promise to cut the government 's share of our total national spending from 23 percent which it be then to 21 percent in fiscal year 1981 we now plan to meet that goal 1 year early

 reduce the deficit will require difficult and unpleasant decision we must face a time of national austerity hard choice be necessary if we want to avoid consequence that be even bad

 i intend to make those hard choice i have already veto bill that would undermine our fight against inflation and the congress have sustain those veto i know that the congress will continue to cooperate in the effort to meet our need in responsible noninflationary way

 i will use the administrative and the budgetary power of my office include the veto if necessary to keep our nation firmly on the path of fiscal restraint

 restraint involve tax policy as well as spend decision tax reduction have never be more politically popular than it be today but if future tax cut be make rashly with no eye on the budget deficit they will hurt we all by cause more inflation

 there be tax cut which could directly lower cost and price and help in the fight against inflation i may consider way to reduce those particular taxis while still cut the budget deficit but until we have a convincing prospect of control inflation i will oppose any further reduction in federal income taxis

 to keep the government to a manageable size i be order tonight a cut in federal hiring this order will mean a reduction of more than 20,000 in the number of permanent federal employee already budget for this fiscal year and will cut the total size of the federal work force

 i have already place a 5?-percent cap on the pay increase for federal employee and federal executive officer be receive no pay increase at all

 it be not enough just to control government deficit spending and hire we must also control the cost of government regulation

 in recent year congress have pass a number of landmark statute to improve social and environmental condition we must and we will continue progress toward protect the health and safety of the american people but we must also realize that everything have a price and that consumer eventually pick up the tab where regulation be essential they must be efficient where they fight inflation they should be encourage where they be unnecessary they should be remove

 early this year i direct federal agency to eliminate unnecessary regulation and to analyze the cost and benefit of new one today for instance the occupational safety and health administration sometimes call osha eliminate nearly 1,000 unnecessary regulation

 now we can build on this progress i have direct a council of my regulatory department and agency to coordinate their regulation to prevent overlapping and duplication most important the council will develop a unified calendar of plan major regulation the calendar will give we for the first time a comprehensive list of regulation the federal government be propose with their cost and objective

 as president i will personally use my authority to ensure that regulation be issue only when need and that they meet their goal at the low possible cost

 we be also cut away the regulatory thicket that have grow up around we and give our competitive free enterprise system a chance to grow up in its place

 last year we give the airline industry a fresh shot of competition regulation be remove free market force drive price down record number of passenger travel and profit go up our new airline deregulation bill will make these benefit permanent for the first time in decade we have actually deregulate a major industry

 next year we will work with congress to bring more competition to other such as the railroad and trucking industry

 of all our weapon against inflation competition be the most powerful without real competition price and wage go up even when demand be go down we must therefore work to allow more competition wherever possible so that powerful group government business labor must think twice before abuse their economic power we will redouble our effort to put competition back into the american free enterprise system

 another reason for inflation be the slowdown in productivity growth more efficient production be essential if we be to control inflation make american good more competitive in world market add new job and increase the real income of our people

 we have make a start toward improve productivity the tax bill just pass by the congress include many of the investment incentive that i recommend last january federal support for research and development will continue to increase especially for basic research we will coordinate and strengthen federal program that support productivity improvement throughout our economy

 our government effort will attack the inflation that hurt most inflation in the essential food housing and medical care

 we will continue to use our agricultural policy to sustain farm production to maintain stable price and to keep inflation down

 rise interest rate have always accompany inflation they add far to the cost of business expansion and to what consumer must pay when they buy house and other consumer item

 the burden of control inflation can not be leave to monetary policy alone which must deal with the problem through tight restriction on money and credit that push interest rate up i will work for a balanced concert and sustain program under which tight budget restraint private wage and price moderation and responsible monetary policy support each other if successful we should expect low inflation and low interest rate for consumer and business alike

 as for medical care where cost have go up much fast than the general inflation rate the most important step we can take be to pass a strong bill to control hospital cost this year the senate pass one next year i will try again and i believe the whole congress will act to hold down hospital cost if your own member of congress hear from you

 between now and january when the new congress convene i will be prepare a package of specific legislative proposal to help fight inflation

 the government will do its part but in a country like ours government can not do the job alone in the end the success or failure of this effort will also rest on whether the private sector will accept and act on the voluntary wage and price standard i be announce tonight

 these standard be fair they be standard that everyone can follow if we do follow they they will slow price down so that wage will not have to chase price just to stay even and they point the way toward an eventual cure for inflation by remove the pressure that cause it in the first place

 in the last 10 year in our attempt to protect ourselves from inflation we have develop attitude and habit that actually keep inflation go once it have begin most company raise their price because they expect cost to rise union call for large wage settlement because they expect inflation to continue because we expect it to happen it do happen and once it be start wage and price chase each other up and up it be like a crowd stand at a football stadium no one can see any well than when everyone be sit down but no one be willing to be the first to sit down

 except for our low pay worker i be ask all employee in this country to limit total wage increase to a maximum of 7 percent per year from tonight on every contract sign and every pay raise grant should meet this standard

 my price limitation will be equally strict our basic target for economy wide price increase be 5 3/4 percent to reach this goal i be tonight set a standard for each firm in the nation to hold its price increase at least one half of one percentage point below what they average during 1976 and 1977

 of course we have to take into account bind commitment already in effect which will prevent an absolute adherence to these standard but this price standard be much low than this year 's inflation rate and more important it be less than the standard for wage increase that difference be account for by rise productivity and it will allow the income of america 's worker to stay ahead of inflation

 this be a standard for everyone to follow everyone as far as i be concern every business every union every professional group every individual in this country have no excuse not to adhere to these standard if we meet these standard the real buying power of your paycheck will rise

 the difficulty with a voluntary program be that worker fear that if they cooperate with the standard while other do not then they will suffer if inflation continue

 to deal with this concern i will ask the congress next january to enact a program that worker who observe the standard would be eligible for a tax rebate if the inflation rate be more than 7 percent in other word they would have a real wage insurance policy against inflation which might be cause by other this will give our worker an additional incentive to observe the program and will remove their only legitimate reason not to cooperate

 because this be not a mandatory control plan i can not stop an irresponsible corporation from raise its price or a selfish group of employee from use its power to demand excessive wage but then if that happen the government will respond use the tool of government authority and public opinion

 soon after they raise price or demand pay increase that be excessive the company or the union will feel the pressure that the public can exert through new competition to drive price down or removal of government protection and privilege which they now enjoy

 we will also make well use of the $ 80 billion worth of purchase the government make from private industry each year we must be prudent buyer if cost rise too fast we can delay those purchase as your family would or switch to another supplier we may not buy a fleet of car this year for example if car cost too much or we may channel our purchase to supplier who have observe our wage and price standard rather than to buy from those who have not

 we will require firm that supply good and service to the government to certify their compliance with the wage and price standard we will make every effort within legal limit to deny government contract to company that fail to meet our wage and price standard we will use our buying power more effectively to make price restraint and competition a reality

 the government now extend economic privilege to many part of the private economy special franchise protect wage and price subsidy protection from foreign competition if wage or price rise too fast in some industry we will take that as a sign that those privilege be no long need and that this protection should be remove we will make sure that no part of our economy be able to use its special privilege or its concentrated power to victimize the rest of we

 this approach i have outline will not end inflation it simply improve our chance of make it well rather than bad to summarize the plan i be announce tonight

 we will cut the budget deficit

 we will slash federal hiring and reduce the federal work force

 we will restrain federal pay

 we will delay further tax cut

 we will remove needless regulation

 we will use federal policy to encourage more competition

 we will set specific standard for both wage and price throughout the economy

 we will use all the power at our disposal to make this program work

 and we will submit new anti inflation proposal to the congress next january include the real wage insurance proposal i have discuss tonight

 i have say many time that these step will be tough and they be but i also say they will be fair and they be they apply equally to all group they give all of we an equal chance to move ahead

 and these proposal which give we a chance also deserve a chance if tomorrow or next week or next month you ridicule they ignore they pick they apart before they have a chance to work then you will have reduce their chance of succeed

 these step can work but that will take time and you be the one who can give they that time if there be one thing i be ask of every american tonight it be to give this plan a chance to work a chance to work for we

 you can help give it that chance by use your influence business and labor must know that you will not tolerate irresponsible price and wage increase your elect official must know how you feel as they make difficult choice

 too often the only voice they hear be those of special interest support their own narrow cause if you want government official to cut inflation you have to make sure that they hear your voice i have hear you with unmistakable clarity

 nearly 40 year ago when the world watch to see whether his nation would survive winston churchill defy those who think britain would fall to the nazi threat churchill reply by ask his countryman what kind of people do they think we be

 there be those today who say that a free economy can not cope with inflation and that we have lose our ability to act as a nation rather than as a collection of special interest and i reply what kind of people do they think we be

 i believe that our people our economic system and our government be equal to this task i hope that you will prove i right

 thank you and good night

mr. president mr. speaker member of the 96th congress and my fellow citizen

 tonight i want to examine in a broad sense the state of our american union how we be build a new foundation for a peaceful and a prosperous world

 our child who will be bear this year will come of age in the 21st century what kind of society what kind of world be we build for they will we ourselves be at peace will our child enjoy a well quality of life will a strong and united america still be a force for freedom and prosperity around the world

 tonight there be every sign that the state of our union be sound

 our economy offer great prosperity for more of our people than ever before real per capita income and real business profit have rise substantially in the last two year farm export be set an all time record each year and farm income last year net farm income be up more than 25 percent

 our liberty be secure our military defense be strong and grow strong and more importantly tonight america our beloved country be at peace

 our early national commitment modify and reshape by succeed generation have serve we well but the problem that we face today be different from those that confront early generation of americans they be more subtle more complex and more interrelated at home we be recognize ever more clearly that government alone can not solve these problem and abroad few of they can be solve by the united states alone but americans as a united people work with our ally and friend have never be afraid to face problem and to solve problem either here or abroad

 the challenge to we be to build a new and firm foundation for the future for a sound economy for a more effective government for more political trust and for a stable peace so that the america our child inherit will be even strong and even well than it be today

 we can not resort to simplistic or extreme solution which substitute myth for common sense

 in our economy it be a myth that we must choose endlessly between inflation and recession together we build the foundation for a strong economy with low inflation without contrive either a recession with its high unemployment or unworkable mandatory government control

 in our government it be a myth that we must choose between compassion and competence together we build the foundation for a government that work and work for people

 in our relation with our potential adversary it be a myth that we must choose between confrontation and capitulation together we build the foundation for a stable world of both diversity and peace

 together we have already begin to build the foundation for confidence in our economic system during the last two year in bring our economy out of the deep recession since the 1930 we have create 7,100,000 new job the unemployment rate have go down 25 percent and now we must redouble our fight against the persistent inflation that have wrack our country for more than a decade that be our important domestic issue and we must do it together

 we know that inflation be a burden for all americans but it be a disaster for the poor the sick and the old no american family should be force to choose among food warmth health care or decent housing because the cost of any of these basic necessity have climb out of reach

 three month ago i outline to the nation a balanced anti inflation program that couple responsible government restraint with responsible wage and price restraint it be base upon my knowledge that there be a more powerful force than government compulsion the force create by the cooperative effort of million of americans work toward a common goal

 business and labor have be increasingly supportive it be imperative that we in government do our part we must stop excessive government growth and we must control government spending habit

 i have send to this congress a stringent but a fair budget one that since i run for president in 1976 will have cut the federal deficit in half and as a percentage of our gross national product the deficit will have drop by almost 75 percent

 this congress have a good record last year and i now ask the 96th congress to continue this partnership in hold the line on excess federal spending it will not be easy but we must be strong and we must be persistent

 this budget be a clear message that with the help of you and the american people i be determine as president to bring inflation under control

 the 1980 budget provide enough spending restraint to begin unwind inflation but enough support for our country to keep american worker productive and to encourage the investment that provide new job we will continue to mobilize our nation 's resource to reduce our trade deficit substantially this year and to maintain the strength of the american dollar

 we have demonstrate in this restrained budget that we can build on the gain of the past two year to provide additional support to educate disadvantaged child to care for the elderly to provide nutrition and legal service for the poor and to strengthen the economic base of our urban community and also our rural area

 this year we will take our first step to develop a national health plan

 we must never accept a permanent group of unemployed americans with no hope and no stake in build our society for those leave out of the economy because of discrimination a lack of skill or poverty we must maintain high level of training and we must continue to provide job

 a responsible budget be not our only weapon to control inflation we must act now to protect all americans from health care cost that be rise $ 1 million per hour 24 hour a day double every five year we must take control of the large contributor to that inflation skyrocket hospital cost

 there will be no clear test of the commitment of this congress to the anti inflation fight than the legislation that i will submit again this year to hold down inflation in hospital care

 over the next five year my proposal will save americans a total of $ 60 billion of which $ 25 billion will be saving to the american taxpayer in the federal budget itself the american people have wait long enough this year we must act on hospital cost containment

 we must also fight inflation by improvement and well enforcement of our antitrust law and by reduce government obstacle to competition in the private sector

 we must begin to scrutinize the overall effect of regulation in our economy through deregulation of the airline industry we have increase profit cut price for all americans and begun for one of the few time in the history of our nation to actually dismantle a major federal bureaucracy this year we must begin the effort to reform our regulatory process for the railroad bus and the trucking industry

 america have the great economic system in the world let us reduce government interference and give it a chance to work

 i call on congress to take other anti inflation action to expand our export to protect american job threaten by unfair trade to conserve energy to increase production and to speed development of solar power and to reassess our nation 's technological superiority american worker who enlist in the fight against inflation deserve not just our gratitude but they deserve the protection of the real wage insurance proposal that i have already make to the congress

 to be successful we must change our attitude as well as our policy we can not afford to live beyond our mean we can not afford to create program that we can neither manage nor finance or to waste our natural resource and we can not tolerate mismanagement and fraud above all we must meet the challenge of inflation as a united people

 with the support of the american people government in recent decade have help to dismantle racial barrier have provide assistance for the jobless and the retire have feed the hungry have protect the safety health and bargaining right of american worker and have help to preserve our natural heritage

 but it be not enough to have create a lot of government program now we must make the good program more effective and improve or weed out those which be wasteful or unnecessary

 with the support of the congress we have begin to reorganize and to get control of the bureaucracy we be reform the civil service system so that we can recognize and reward those who do a good job and correct or remove those who do not

 this year we must extend major reorganization effort to education to economic development and to the management of our natural resource we need to enact a sunshine sunset law that when government program have outlive their value they will automatically be terminate

 there be no such thing as an effective and a noncontroversial reorganization and reform but we know that honest effective government be essential to restore public faith in our public action

 none of we can be satisfied when two third of the american citizen choose not to vote last year in a national election too many americans feel powerless against the influence of private lobbying group and the unbelievable flood of private campaign money which threaten our electoral process

 this year we must regain the public 's faith by require limited financial fund from public fund for congressional election campaign house bill 1 provide for this public financing of campaign and i look forward with a great deal of anticipation to sign it at an early date

 a strong economy and an effective government will restore confidence in america but the path of the future must be chart in peace we must continue to build a new and a firm foundation for a stable world community

 we be build that new foundation from a position of national strength the strength of our own defense the strength of our friendship with other nation and of our old american ideal

 america 's military power be a major force for security and stability in the world we must maintain our strategic capability and continue the progress of the last two year with our nato allies with whom we have increase our readiness modernize our equipment and strengthen our defense force in europe i urge you to support the strong defense budget which i have propose to the congress

 but our national security in this complicated age require more than just military might in less than a lifetime world population have more than double colonial empire have disappear and a hundred new nation have be bear mass communication literacy and migration to the world 's city have all awaken new yearning for economic justice and human right among people everywhere

 this demand for justice and human right be a wave of the future in such a world the choice be not which super power will dominate the world none can and none will the choice instead be between a world of anarchy and destruction or a world of cooperation and peace

 in such a world we seek not to stifle inevitable change but to influence its course in helpful and constructive way that enhance our value our national interest and the cause of peace

 tower over this volatile change world like a thundercloud on a summer day loom the awesome power of nuclear weapon

 we will continue to help shape the force of change to anticipate emerge problem of nuclear proliferation and conventional arm sale and to use our great strength and influence to settle international conflict in other part of the world before they erupt and spread

 we have no desire to be the world 's policeman but america do want to be the world 's peacemaker

 we be build the foundation for truly global cooperation not only with western and industrialized nation but with the develop country as well our tie with japan and our european ally be strong than ever and so be our friendly relation with the people of latin america africa and the western pacific and asia

 we have win new respect in this hemisphere with the panama canal treaty we have gain new trust with the develop world through our opposition to racism our commitment to human right and our support for majority rule in africa

 the multilateral trade negotiation be now reach a successful conclusion and congressional approval be essential to the economic well being of our own country and of the world this will be one of our top priority in 1979

 we be enter a hopeful era in our relation with one fourth of the world 's people who live in china the presence of vice premier deng xiaoping next week will help to inaugurate that new era and with prompt congressional action on authorize legislation we will continue our commitment to a prosperous peaceful and secure life for the people of taiwan

 i be grateful that in the past year as in the year before no american have die in combat anywhere in the world and in iran nicaragua cyprus namibia and rhodesia our country be work for peaceful solution to dangerous conflict

 in the middle east under the most difficult circumstance we have seek to help ancient enemy lay aside deep seat difference that have produce four bitter war in our lifetime

 our firm commitment to israel 's survival and security be root in our deep conviction and in our knowledge of the strategic importance to our own nation of a stable middle east to promote peace and reconciliation in the region we must retain the trust and the confidence both of israel and also of the arab nation that be sincerely search for peace

 i be determine as president to use the full beneficial influence of our country so that the precious opportunity for last peace between israel and egypt will not be lose the new foundation of international cooperation that we seek exclude no nation cooperation with the soviet union serve the cause of peace for in this nuclear age world peace must include peace between the super power and it must mean the control of nuclear arm

 ten year ago the united states and the soviet union make the historic decision to open the strategic arm limitation talk or salt the purpose of salt then as now be not to gain a unilateral advantage for either nation but to protect the security of both nation to reverse the costly and dangerous momentum of the nuclear arm race to preserve a stable balance of nuclear force and to demonstrate to a concerned world that we be determined to help preserve the peace

 the first salt agreement be conclude in 1972 and since then during six year of negotiation by both republican and democratic leader nearly all issue of salt ii have be resolve if the soviet union continue to negotiate in good faith a responsible salt agreement will be reach

 it be important that the american people understand the nature of the salt process

 salt ii be not base on sentiment it be base on self interest of the united states and of the soviet union both nation share a powerful common interest in reduce the threat of a nuclear war i will sign no agreement which do not enhance our national security

 salt ii do not rely on trust it will be verifiable we have very sophisticated proven mean include our satellite to determine for ourselves whether or not the soviet union be meet its treaty obligation i will sign no agreement which can not he verify

 the american nuclear deterrent will remain strong after salt ii for example just one of our relatively invulnerable poseidon submarine comprise less than 2 percent of our total nuclear force of submarine aircraft and landbase missile carry enough warhead to destroy every large- and medium sized city in the soviet union our deterrent be overwhelming and i will sign no agreement unless our deterrent force will remain overwhelming

 a salt agreement of course can not substitute for wise diplomacy or a strong defense nor will it end the danger of nuclear war but it will certainly reduce that danger it will strengthen our effort to ban nuclear test and to stop the spread of atomic weapon to other nation and it can begin the process of negotiate new agreement which will far limit nuclear arm

 the path of arm control back by a strong defense the path our nation and every president have walk for 30 year can lead to a world of law and of international negotiation and consultation in which all people might live in peace in this year 1979 nothing be more important than that the congress and the people of the united states resolve to continue with i on that path of nuclear arm control and world peace this be paramount

 i have outline some of the change that have transform the world and which be continue as we meet here tonight but we in america need not fear change the value on which our nation be found individual liberty self determination the potential for human fulfillment in freedom all of these endure we find these democratic principle praise even in book smuggle out of totalitarian nation and on wallposter in land which we think be close to our influence our country have regain its special place of leadership in the worldwide struggle for human right and that be a commitment that we must keep at home as well as abroad

 the civil right revolution free all americans black and white but its full promise still remain unrealized i will continue to work with all my strength for equal opportunity for all americans and for affirmative action for those who carry the extra burden of past denial of equal opportunity

 we remain committed to improve our labor law to well protect the right of american worker and our nation must make it clear that the legal right of woman as citizen be guarantee under the law of our land by ratify the equal right amendment

 as long as i be president at home and around the world america 's example and america 's influence will be marshal to advance the cause of human right

 to establish those value two century ago a bold generation of americans risk their property their position and life itself we be their heir and they be send we a message across the century the word they make so vivid be now grow faintly indistinct because they be not hear often enough they be word like justice equality unity truth sacrifice liberty faith and love

 these word remind we that the duty of our generation of americans be to renew our nation 's faith not focus just against foreign threat but against the threat of selfishness cynicism and apathy

 the new foundation i have discuss tonight can help we build a nation and a world where every child be nurture and can look to the future with hope where the resource now waste on war can be turn towards meet human need where all people have enough to eat a decent home and protection against disease

 it can help we build a nation and a world where all people be free to seek the truth and to add to human understanding so that all of we may live our life in peace

 tonight i ask you the member of the congress to join i in build that new foundation a well foundation for our beloved country and our world

 thank you very much



good evening
 this be a special night for i exactly 3 year ago on july 15 1976 i accept the nomination of my party to run for president of the united states i promise you a president who be not isolate from the people who feel your pain and who share your dream and who draw his strength and his wisdom from you
 during the past 3 year i have speak to you on many occasion about national concern the energy crisis reorganize the government our nation 's economy and issue of war and especially peace but over those year the subject of the speech the talk and the press conference have become increasingly narrow focus more and more on what the isolated world of washington think be important gradually you have hear more and more about what the government think or what the government should be do and less and less about our nation 's hope our dream and our vision of the future
 ten day ago i have plan to speak to you again about a very important subject energy for the fifth time i would have describe the urgency of the problem and lay out a series of legislative recommendation to the congress but as i be prepare to speak i begin to ask myself the same question that i now know have be troubling many of you why have we not be able to get together as a nation to resolve our serious energy problem
 it be clear that the true problem of our nation be much deep deep than gasoline line or energy shortage deeply even than inflation or recession and i realize more than ever that as president i need your help so i decide to reach out and listen to the voice of america
 i invite to camp david people from almost every segment of our society business and labor teacher and preacher governors mayor and private citizen and then i leave camp david to listen to other americans man and woman like you it have be an extraordinary 10 day and i want to share with you what i have hear
 first of all i get a lot of personal advice let i quote a few of the typical comment that i write down
 this from a southern governor mr. president you be not lead this nation you be just manage the government
 you do not see the people enough any more
 some of your cabinet member do not seem loyal there be not enough discipline among your disciple
 do not talk to we about politic or the mechanic of government but about an understanding of our common good
 mr. president we be in trouble talk to we about blood and sweat and tear
 if you lead mr. president we will follow
 many people talk about themselves and about the condition of our nation this from a young woman in pennsylvania i feel so far from government i feel like ordinary people be exclude from political power
 and this from a young chicano some of we have suffer from recession all our life
 some people have waste energy but other have not have anything to waste
 and this from a religious leader no material shortage can touch the important thing like god 's love for we or our love for one another
 and i like this one particularly from a black woman who happen to be the mayor of a small mississippi town the big shot be not the only one who be important remember you can not sell anything on wall street unless someone dig it up somewhere else first
 this kind of summarize a lot of other statement mr. president we be confront with a moral and a spiritual crisis
 several of our discussion be on energy and i have a notebook full of comment and advice i will read just a few
 we can not go on consume 40 percent more energy than we produce when we import oil we be also import inflation plus unemployment
 we have get to use what we have the middle east have only 5 percent of the world 's energy but the united states have 24 percent
 and this be one of the most vivid statement our neck be stretch over the fence and opec have a knife
 there will be other cartel and other shortage american wisdom and courage right now can set a path to follow in the future
 this be a good one be bold mr. president we may make mistake but we be ready to experiment
 and this one from a labor leader get to the heart of it the real issue be freedom we must deal with the energy problem on a war footing
 and the last that i will read when we enter the moral equivalent of war mr. president do not issue we bb gun
 these 10 day confirm my belief in the decency and the strength and the wisdom of the american people but it also bear out some of my longstanding concern about our nation 's underlie problem
 i know of course be president that government action and legislation can be very important that be why i have work hard to put my campaign promise into law and i have to admit with just mixed success but after listen to the american people i have be remind again that all the legislation in the world can not fix what be wrong with america so i want to speak to you first tonight about a subject even more serious than energy or inflation i want to talk to you right now about a fundamental threat to american democracy
 i do not mean our political and civil liberty they will endure and i do not refer to the outward strength of america a nation that be at peace tonight everywhere in the world with unmatched economic power and military might
 the threat be nearly invisible in ordinary way it be a crisis of confidence it be a crisis that strike at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will we can see this crisis in the grow doubt about the meaning of our own life and in the loss of a unity of purpose for our nation
 the erosion of our confidence in the future be threaten to destroy the social and the political fabric of america
 the confidence that we have always have as a people be not simply some romantic dream or a proverb in a dusty book that we read just on the fourth of july it be the idea which found our nation and have guide our development as a people confidence in the future have support everything else public institution and private enterprise our own family and the very constitution of the united states confidence have define our course and have serve as a link between generation we have always believe in something call progress we have always have a faith that the day of our child would be well than our own
 our people be lose that faith not only in government itself but in the ability as citizen to serve as the ultimate ruler and shaper of our democracy as a people we know our past and we be proud of it our progress have be part of the live history of america even the world we always believe that we be part of a great movement of humanity itself call democracy involve in the search for freedom and that belief have always strengthen we in our purpose but just as we be lose our confidence in the future we be also begin to close the door on our past
 in a nation that be proud of hard work strong family close knit community and our faith in god too many of we now tend to worship self indulgence and consumption human identity be no long define by what one do but by what one own but we have discover that own thing and consume thing do not satisfy our longing for meaning we have learn that pile up material good can not fill the emptiness of life which have no confidence or purpose
 the symptom of this crisis of the american spirit be all around we for the first time in the history of our country a majority of our people believe that the next 5 year will be bad than the past 5 year two third of our people do not even vote the productivity of american worker be actually drop and the willingness of americans to save for the future have fall below that of all other people in the western world
 as you know there be a grow disrespect for government and for church and for school the news medium and other institution this be not a message of happiness or reassurance but it be the truth and it be a warning
 these change do not happen overnight they have come upon we gradually over the last generation year that be fill with shock and tragedy
 we be sure that our be a nation of the ballot not the bullet until the murder of john kennedy and robert kennedy and martin luther king jr. we be teach that our army be always invincible and our cause be always just only to suffer the agony of vietnam we respect the presidency as a place of honor until the shock of watergate
 we remember when the phrase sound as a dollar be an expression of absolute dependability until 10 year of inflation begin to shrink our dollar and our saving we believe that our nation 's resource be limitless until 1973 when we have to face a grow dependence on foreign oil
 these wound be still very deep they have never be heal
 look for a way out of this crisis our people have turn to the federal government and find it isolate from the mainstream of our nation 's life washington d.c. have become an island the gap between our citizen and our government have never be so wide the people be look for honest answer not easy answer clear leadership not false claim and evasiveness and politic as usual
 what you see too often in washington and elsewhere around the country be a system of government that seem incapable of action you see a congress twist and pull in every direction by hundred of well finance and powerful special interest you see every extreme position defend to the last vote almost to the last breath by one unyielding group or another you often see a balanced and a fair approach that demand sacrifice a little sacrifice from everyone abandon like an orphan without support and without friend
 often you see paralysis and stagnation and drift you do not like it and neither do i. what can we do
 first of all we must face the truth and then we can change our course we simply must have faith in each other faith in our ability to govern ourselves and faith in the future of this nation restore that faith and that confidence to america be now the most important task we face it be a true challenge of this generation of americans
 one of the visitor to camp david last week put it this way we have get to stop cry and start sweating stop talk and start walk stop curse and start pray the strength we need will not come from the white house but from every house in america
 we know the strength of america we be strong we can regain our unity we can regain our confidence we be the heir of generation who survive threat much more powerful and awesome than those that challenge we now our father and mother be strong man and woman who shape a new society during the great depression who fight world war and who carve out a new charter of peace for the world
 we ourselves be the same americans who just 10 year ago put a man on the moon we be the generation that dedicate our society to the pursuit of human right and equality and we be the generation that will win the war on the energy problem and in that process rebuild the unity and confidence of america
 we be at a turning point in our history there be two path to choose one be a path i have warn about tonight the path that lead to fragmentation and self interest down that road lie a mistaken idea of freedom the right to grasp for ourselves some advantage over other that path would be one of constant conflict between narrow interest end in chaos and immobility it be a certain route to failure
 all the tradition of our past all the lesson of our heritage all the promise of our future point to another path the path of common purpose and the restoration of american value that path lead to true freedom for our nation and ourselves we can take the first step down that path as we begin to solve our energy problem
 energy will be the immediate test of our ability to unite this nation and it can also be the standard around which we rally on the battlefield of energy we can win for our nation a new confidence and we can seize control again of our common destiny
 in little more than two decade we have go from a position of energy independence to one in which almost half the oil we use come from foreign country at price that be go through the roof our excessive dependence on opec have already take a tremendous toll on our economy and our people this be the direct cause of the long line which have make million of you spend aggravating hour wait for gasoline it be a cause of the increase inflation and unemployment that we now face this intolerable dependence on foreign oil threaten our economic independence and the very security of our nation
 the energy crisis be real it be worldwide it be a clear and present danger to our nation these be fact and we simply must face they
 what i have to say to you now about energy be simple and vitally important
 point one i be tonight set a clear goal for the energy policy of the united states begin this moment this nation will never use more foreign oil than we do in 1977 never from now on every new addition to our demand for energy will be meet from our own production and our own conservation the generation long growth in our dependence on foreign oil will be stop dead in its track right now and then reverse as we move through the 1980 's for i be tonight set the further goal of cut our dependence on foreign oil by one half by the end of the next decade a saving of over 4 1/2 million barrel of import oil per day
 point two to ensure that we meet these target i will use my presidential authority to set import quota i be announce tonight that for 1979 and 1980 i will forbid the entry into this country of one drop of foreign oil more than these goal allow these quota will ensure a reduction in import even below the ambitious level we set at the recent tokyo summit
 point three to give we energy security i be ask for the most massive peacetime commitment of fund and resource in our nation 's history to develop america 's own alternative source of fuel from coal from oil shale from plant product for gasohol from unconventional gas from the sun
 i propose the creation of an energy security corporation to lead this effort to replace 2 1/2 million barrel of import oil per day by 1990 the corporation will issue up to $ 5 billion in energy bond and i especially want they to be in small denomination so that average americans can invest directly in america 's energy security
 just as a similar synthetic rubber corporation help we win world war ii so will we mobilize american determination and ability to win the energy war moreover i will soon submit legislation to congress call for the creation of this nation 's first solar bank which will help we achieve the crucial goal of 20 percent of our energy come from solar power by the year 2000
 these effort will cost money a lot of money and that be why congress must enact the windfall profit tax without delay it will be money well spend unlike the billion of dollar that we ship to foreign country to pay for foreign oil these fund will be pay by americans to americans these fund will go to fight not to increase inflation and unemployment
 point four i be ask congress to mandate to require as a matter of law that our nation 's utility company cut their massive use of oil by 50 percent within the next decade and switch to other fuel especially coal our most abundant energy source
 point five to make absolutely certain that nothing stand in the way of achieve these goal i will urge congress to create an energy mobilization board which like the war production board in world war ii will have the responsibility and authority to cut through the redtape the delay and the endless roadblock to complete key energy project
 we will protect our environment but when this nation critically need a refinery or a pipeline we will build it
 point six i be propose a bold conservation program to involve every state county and city and every average american in our energy battle this effort will permit you to build conservation into your home and your life at a cost you can afford
 i ask congress to give i authority for mandatory conservation and for standby gasoline rationing to far conserve energy i be propose tonight an extra $ 10 billion over the next decade to strengthen our public transportation system and i be ask you for your good and for your nation 's security to take no unnecessary trip to use carpool or public transportation whenever you can to park your car one extra day per week to obey the speed limit and to set your thermostat to save fuel every act of energy conservation like this be more than just common sense i tell you it be an act of patriotism
 our nation must be fair to the poor among we so we will increase aid to needy americans to cope with rise energy price we often think of conservation only in term of sacrifice in fact it be the most painless and immediate way of rebuild our nation 's strength every gallon of oil each one of we save be a new form of production it give we more freedom more confidence that much more control over our own life
 so the solution of our energy crisis can also help we to conquer the crisis of the spirit in our country it can rekindle our sense of unity our confidence in the future and give our nation and all of we individually a new sense of purpose
 you know we can do it we have the natural resource we have more oil in our shale alone than several saudi arabias we have more coal than any nation on earth we have the world 's high level of technology we have the most skilled work force with innovative genius and i firmly believe that we have the national will to win this war
 i do not promise you that this struggle for freedom will be easy i do not promise a quick way out of our nation 's problem when the truth be that the only way out be an all out effort what i do promise you be that i will lead our fight and i will enforce fairness in our struggle and i will ensure honesty and above all i will act
 we can manage the short term shortage more effectively and we will but there be no short term solution to our long range problem there be simply no way to avoid sacrifice
 twelve hour from now i will speak again in kansas city to expand and to explain far our energy program just as the search for solution to our energy shortage have now lead we to a new awareness of our nation 's deep problem so our willingness to work for those solution in energy can strengthen we to attack those deep problem
 i will continue to travel this country to hear the people of america you can help i to develop a national agenda for the 1980s i will listen and i will act we will act together these be the promise i make 3 year ago and i intend to keep they
 little by little we can and we must rebuild our confidence we can spend until we empty our treasury and we may summon all the wonder of science but we can succeed only if we tap our great resource america 's people america 's value and america 's confidence
 i have see the strength of america in the inexhaustible resource of our people in the day to come let we renew that strength in the struggle for an energy secure nation
 in closing let i say this i will do my good but i will not do it alone let your voice be hear whenever you have a chance say something good about our country with god 's help and for the sake of our nation it be time for we to join hand in america let we commit ourselves together to a rebirth of the american spirit work together with our common faith we can not fail
 thank you and good night

good evening i be here tonight to announce my intention to seek the republican nomination for president of the united states

 i ’m sure that each of we have see our country from a number of viewpoint depend on where we ’ve live and what we ’ve do for i it have be as a boy grow up in several small town in illinois as a young man in iowa try to get a start in the year of the great depression and later in california for most of my adult life

 i ’ve see america from the stadium press box as a sportscaster as an actor officer of my labor union soldier officeholder and as both democrat and republican i ’ve live in an america where those who often have too little to eat outnumber those who have enough there have be four war in my lifetime and i ’ve see our country face financial ruin in depression i have also see the great strength of this nation as it pull itself up from that ruin to become the dominant force in the world

 to i our country be a living breathe presence unimpressed by what other say be impossible proud of its own success generous yes and naïve sometimes wrong never mean and always impatient to provide a well life for its people in a framework of a basic fairness and freedom

 someone once say that the difference between an american and any other kind of person be that an american life in anticipation of the future because he know it will be a great place other people fear the future as just a repetition of past failure there ’ a lot of truth in that if there be one thing we be sure of it be that history need not be relive that nothing be impossible and that man be capable of improve his circumstance beyond what we be tell be fact

 there be those in our land today however who would have we believe that the united states like other great civilization of the past have reach the zenith of its power that we be weak and fearful reduce to bicker with each other and no long possess of the will to cope with our problem

 much of this talk have come from leader who claim that our problem be too difficult to handle we be suppose to meekly accept their failure as the most which humanly can be do they tell we we must learn to live with less and teach our child that their life will be less full and prosperous than our have be that the america of the come year will be a place where because of our past excess it will be impossible to dream and make those dream come true

 i do not believe that and i do not believe you do either that be why i be seek the presidency i can not and will not stand by and see this great country destroy itself our leader attempt to blame their failure on circumstance beyond their control on false estimate by unknown unidentifiable expert who rewrite modern history in an attempt to convince we our high standard of living the result of thrift and hard work be somehow selfish extravagance which we must renounce as we join in share scarcity i do not agree that our nation must resign itself to inevitable decline yield its proud position to other hand i be totally unwilling to see this country fail in its obligation to itself and to the other free people of the world

 the crisis we face be not the result of any failure of the american spirit it be a failure of our leader to establish rational goal and give our people something to order their life by if i be elect i shall regard my election as proof that the people of the united states have decide to set a new agenda and have recognize that the human spirit thrive well when goal be set and progress can be measure in their achievement

 during the next year i shall discuss in detail a wide variety of problem which a new administration must address tonight i shall mention only a few

 no problem that we face today can compare with the need to restore the health of the american economy and the strength of the american dollar double digit inflation have rob you and your family of the ability to plan it have destroy the confidence to buy and it threaten the very structure of family life itself as more and more wife be force to work in order to help meet the ever increase cost of living at the same time the lack of year growth in the economy have introduce the justifiable fear in the mind of work man and woman who be already over extended that soon there will be few job and no money to pay for even the necessity of life and tragically as the cost of living keep go up the standard of living which have be our great pride keep go down

 the people have not create this disaster in our economy the federal government have it have overspent overestimated and over regulated it have fail to deliver service within the revenue it should be allow to raise from taxis in the thirty four year since the end of world war ii it have spend 448 billion dollar more than it have collection in taxes—448 billion dollar of print press money which have make every dollar you earn worth less and less at the same time the federal government have cynically tell we that high taxis on business will in some way solve the problem and allow the average taxpayer to pay less well business be not a taxpayer it be a tax collector business have to pass its tax burden on to the customer as part of the cost of do business you and i pay the taxis impose on business every time we go to the store only people pay taxis and it be political demagoguery or economic illiteracy to try and tell we otherwise

 the key to restore the health of the economy lie in cut taxis at the same time we need to get the waste out of federal spending this do not mean sacrifice essential service nor do we need to destroy the system of benefit which flow to the poor the elderly the sick and the handicap we have long since commit ourselves as a people to help those among we who can not take care of themselves but the federal government have prove to be the costly and most inefficient provider of such help we could possibly have

 we must put an end to the arrogance of a federal establishment which accept no blame for our condition can not be rely upon to give we a fair estimate of our situation and utterly refuse to live within its mean i will not accept the suppose wisdom which have it that the federal bureaucracy have become so powerful that it can no long be change or control by any administration as president i would use every power at my command to make the federal establishment respond to the will and the collective wish of the people

 we must force the entire federal bureaucracy to live in the real world of reduce spending streamlined function and accountability to the people it serve we must review the function of the federal government to determine which of those be the proper province of level of government close to the people

 the 10th article of the bill of rights be explicit in point out that the federal government should do only those thing specifically call for in the constitution all other shall remain with the state or the people we have n’t be observe that 10th article of late the federal government have take on function it be never intend to perform and which it do not perform well there should be a plan orderly transfer of such function to state and community and a transfer with they of the source of taxation to pay for they

 the saving in administrative would be considerable and certainly there would be increase efficiency and less bureaucracy

 by reduce federal tax rate where they discourage individual initiative especially personal income tax rate we can restore incentive invite great economic growth and at the same time help give we well government instead of big government proposal such as the kemp roth bill would bring about this kind of realistic reduction in tax rate

 in short a punitive tax system must be replace by one that restore incentive for the worker and for industry a system that reward initiative and effort and encourage thrift

 all these thing be possible none of they will be easy but the choice be clear we can go on let the country slip over the brink to financial ruin with the disaster that it mean for the individual or we can find the will to work together to restore confidence in ourselves and to regain the confidence of the world i have live through one depression i carry with i the memory of a christmas eve when my brother and i and our parent exchange modest gift there be no lighted tree as there have be on christmases past i remember watch my father open what he think be a greeting from his employer we all watch and yes we be hope for a bonus check it be notice that he no long have a job and in those day the government run radio announcement tell worker not to leave home look for job there be no job i ’ll carry with i always the memory of my father sit there hold that envelope unable to look at we i can not and will not stand by while inflation and joblessness destroy the dignity of our people

 another serious problem which must be discuss tonight be our energy situation our country be build on cheap energy today energy be not cheap and we face the prospect that some form of energy may soon not be available at all

 last summer you probably spend hour sit in gasoline line this winter some will be without heat and everyone will be pay much more simply to keep home and family warm if you ever have any doubt of the government ’s inability to provide for the need of the people just look at the utter fiasco we now call the energy crisis not one straight answer nor any realistic hope of relief have come from the present administration in almost three year of federal treatment of the problem as gas line grow the administration again panic and now have propose to put the country on a wartime footing but for this war there be no victory in sight and as always when the federal bureaucracy fail all it can suggest be more of the same this time it ’ another bureau to untangle the mess make by the one we already have

 but this just will not work solve the energy crisis will not be easy but it can be do first we must decide that less be not enough next we must remove government obstacle to energy production and we must make use of those technological advantage we still possess

 it be no program simply to say use less energy of course waste must be eliminate and efficiency promote but not an energy policy at good it mean we will run out of energy a little more slowly but a day will come when the light will dim and the wheel of industry will turn more slowly and finally stop as president i will not endorse any course which have this as its principle objective

 we need more energy and that mean diversify our source of supply away from the opec country yes it mean more efficient automobile but it also mean more exploration and development of oil and natural gas here in our own country the only way to free ourselves from the monopoly pricing power of opec be to be less dependent on outside source of fuel

 the answer obvious to anyone except those in the administration it seem be more domestic production of oil and gas we must also have wide use of nuclear power within strict safety rule of course there must be more spending by the energy industry on research and development of substitute for fossil fuel

 in year to come solar energy may provide much of the answer but for the next two or three decade we must do such thing as master the chemistry of coal put the market system to work for these objective be an essential first step for their achievement additional multi billion dollar federal bureaus and program be not the answer

 in recent week there have be much talk about excess oil company profit i do not believe we ’ve be give all the information we need to make a judgement about this we should have that information government exist to protect we from each other it be not government ’s function to allocate fuel or impose unnecessary restriction on the marketplace it be government ’s function to determine whether we be be unfairly exploit and if so to take immediate and appropriate action as president i would do exactly that

 on the foreign front the decade of the 1980 's will place severe pressure upon the united states and its ally we can expect to be test in way calculate to try our patience to confound our resolve and to erode our belief in ourselves during a time when the soviet union may enjoy nuclear superiority over this country we must never waiver in our commitment to our ally nor accept any negotiation which be not clearly in the national interest we must judge carefully though we should leave no initiative untried in our pursuit of peace we must be clear voice in our resolve to resist any unpeaceful act wherever it may occur negotiation with the soviet union must never become appeasement

 for the most of the last forty year we have be preoccupy with the global struggle the competition with the soviet union and with our responsibility to our ally but too often in recent time we have just drift along with event respond as if we think of ourselves as a nation in decline to our ally we seem to appear to be a nation unable to make decision in its own interest let alone in the common interest since the second world war we have spend large amount of money and much of our time protect and defend freedom all over the world we must continue this for if we do not accept the responsibility of leadership who will and if no one will how will we survive

 the 1970 ’s have teach we the foolhardiness of not have a long range diplomatic strategy of our own the world have become a place where in order to survive our country need more than just ally it need real friend yet in recent time we often seem not to have recognize who our friend be this must change it be now time to take stock of our own house and to resupply its strength

 part of that process involve take stock of our relationship with puerto rico i favor statehood for puerto rico and if the people of puerto rico vote for statehood in their come referendum i would as president initiate the enable legislation to make this a reality

 we live on a continent whose three country possess the asset to make it the strong most prosperous and self sufficient area on earth within the border of this north american continent be the food resource technology and undeveloped territory which properly manage could dramatically improve the quality of life of all its inhabitant

 it be no accident that this unmatched potential for progress and prosperity exist in three country with such long stand heritage of free government a develop closeness among canada mexico and the united states a north american accord would permit achievement of that potential in each country beyond that which i believe any of they strong as they be could accomplish in the absence of such cooperation in fact the key to our own future security may lie in both mexico and canada become much strong country than they be today

 no one can say at this point what form future cooperation among our three country will take but if i be elect president i would be willing to invite each of our neighbor to send a special representative to our government to sit in on high level planning session with we as partner mutually concerned about the future of our continent first i would immediately seek the view and idea of canadian and mexican leader on this issue and work tirelessly with they to develop close tie among our people it be time we stop think of our near neighbor as foreigner

 by develop method of work closely together we will lay the foundation for future cooperation on a broad and more significant scale we will also put to rest any doubt of those cynical enough to believe that the united states would seek to dominate any relationship among our three country or foolish enough to think that the government and people of canada and mexico would ever permit such domination to occur i for one be confident that we can show the world by example that the nation of north america be ready within the context of an unswerve commitment to freedom to seek new form of accommodation to meet a change world a develop closeness between the united states canada and mexico would serve notice on friend and foe alike that we be prepare for a long haul look outward again and confident our of future that together we be go to create job to generate new fortune of wealth for many and provide a legacy for the child of each of our country

 two hundred year ago we teach the world that a new form of government create out of the genius of man to cope with his circumstance could succeed in bring a measure of quality to human life previously think impossible

 now let we work toward the goal of use the asset of this continent its resource technology and foodstuff in the most efficient way possible for the common good of all its people it may take the next 100 year but we can dare to dream that at some future date a map of the world might show the north american continent as one in which the people and commerce of its three strong country flow more freely across their present border than they do today

 in recent month leader in our government have tell we that we the people have lose confidence in ourselves that we must regain the spirit and our will to achieve our national goal well it be true there be a lack of confidence an unease with thing the way they be but the confidence we have lose be confidence in our government ’s policy our unease can almost be call bewilderment at how our defense strength have deteriorate the great productivity of our industry be now surpass by virtually all the major nation who compete with we for world market and our currency be no long the stable measure of value it once be

 but there remain the greatness of our people our capacity for dream up fantastic deed and bring they off to the surprise of an unbelieving world when washington ’s man be freeze at valley forge tom paine tell his fellow americans we have it in our power to begin the world over again we still have that power

 we today ’s live americans have in our lifetime fight hard pay a high price for freedom and do more to advance the dignity of man than any people who ever live on this earth the citizen of this great nation want leadership yes but not a man on a white horse demand obedience to his command they want someone who believe they can begin the world over again a leader who will unleash their great strength and remove the roadblock government have put in their way i want to do that more than anything i ’ve ever want and it ’ something that i believe with god ’s help i can do

 i believe this nation hunger for a spiritual revival hunger to once again see honor place above political expediency to see government once again the protector of our liberty not the distributor of gift and privilege government should uphold and not undermine those institution which be custodian of the very value upon which civilization be found religion education and above all family government can not be clergyman teacher and parent it be our servant beholden to we

 we who be privileged to be americans have have a rendezvous with destiny since the moment in 1630 when john winthrop stand on the deck of the tiny arbella off the coast of massachusetts tell the little band of pilgrim we shall be as a city upon a hill the eye of all people be upon we so that if we shall deal falsely with our god in this work we have undertake and so cause he to withdraw his present help from we we shall be make a story and a byword throughout the world

 a troubled and afflict mankind look to we plead for we to keep our rendezvous with destiny that we will uphold the principle of self reliance self discipline morality and above all responsible liberty for every individual that we will become that shine city on a hill

 i believe that you and i together can keep this rendezvous with destiny

 thank you and good night







 i come to you this evening to discuss the extremely important and rapidly change circumstance in southwest asia

 i continue to share with all of you the sense of outrage and impatience because of the kidnaping of innocent american hostage and the holding of they by militant terrorist with the support and the approval of iranian official our purpose continue to be the protection of the longrange interest of our nation and the safety of the american hostage

 we be attempt to secure the release of the americans through the international court of justice through the united nations and through public and private diplomatic effort we be determined to achieve this goal we hope to do so without bloodshed and without any further danger to the life of our 50 fellow americans in these effort we continue to have the strong support of the world community the unity and the common sense of the american people under such try circumstance be essential to the success of our effort

 recently there have be another very serious development which threaten the maintenance of the peace in southwest asia massive soviet military force have invade the small nonaligne sovereign nation of afghanistan which have hitherto not be an occupied satellite of the soviet union

 fifty thousand heavily armed soviet troop have cross the border and be now disperse throughout afghanistan attempt to conquer the fiercely independent muslim people of that country

 the soviets claim falsely that they be invite into afghanistan to help protect that country from some unnamed outside threat but the president who have be the leader of afghanistan before the soviet invasion be assassinated?along with several member of his family?after the soviets gain control of the capital city of kabul only several day later be the new puppet leader even bring into afghanistan by the soviets
 this invasion be an extremely serious threat to peace because of the threat of further soviet expansion into neighboring country in southwest asia and also because such an aggressive military policy be unsettling to other people throughout the world

 this be a callous violation of international law and the united nations charter it be a deliberate effort of a powerful atheistic government to subjugate an independent islamic people

 we must recognize the strategic importance of afghanistan to stability and peace a soviet occupy afghanistan threaten both iran and pakistan and be a steppingstone to possible control over much of the world 's oil supply

 the united states want all nation in the region to be free and to be independent if the soviets be encourage in this invasion by eventual success and if they maintain their dominance over afghanistan and then extend their control to adjacent country the stable strategic and peaceful balance of the entire world will be change this would threaten the security of all nation include of course the united states our ally and our friend

 therefore the world simply can not stand by and permit the soviet union to commit this act with impunity fifty nation have petition the united nations security council to condemn the soviet union and to demand the immediate withdrawal of all soviet troop from afghanistan we realize that under the united nations charter the soviet union and other permanent member may veto action of the security council if the will of the security council should be thwart in this manner then immediate action would be appropriate in the general assembly of the united nations where no soviet veto exist

 in the meantime neither the united states nor any other nation which be commit to world peace and stability can continue to do business as usual with the soviet union

 i have already recall the united states ambassador from moscow hack to washington he be work with i and with my other senior adviser in an immediate and comprehensive evaluation of the whole range of our relation with the soviet union

 the successful negotiation of the salt ii treaty have be a major goal and a major achievement of this administration and we americans the people of the soviet union and indeed the entire world will benefit from the successful control of strategic nuclear weapon through the implementation of this carefully negotiate treaty

 however because of the soviet aggression i have ask the united states senate to defer further consideration of the salt ii treaty so that the congress and i can assess soviet action and intention and devote our primary attention to the legislative and other measure require to respond to this crisis as circumstance change in the future we will of course keep the ratification of salt ii under active review in consultation with the leader of the senate

 the soviets must understand our deep concern we will delay opening of any new american or soviet consular facility and most of the cultural and economic exchange currently under consideration will be defer trade with the soviet union will be severely restrict

 i have decide to halt or to reduce export to the soviet union in three area that be particularly important to they these new policy be be and will be coordinate with those of our ally
 i have direct that no high technology or other strategic item will be license for sale to the soviet union until further notice while we revise our licensing policy

 fishing privilege for the soviet union in united states water will be severely curtail

 the 17 million ton of grain order by the soviet union in excess of that amount which we be commit to sell will not be deliver this grain be not intend for human consumption but be to be use for build up soviet livestock herd

 i be determined to minimize any adverse impact on the american farmer from this action the undelivered grain will be remove from the market through storage and price support program and through purchase at market price we will also increase amount of grain devote to the alleviation of hunger in poor country and we will have a massive increase of the use of grain for gasohol production here at home

 after consultation with other principal grain export nation i be confident that they will not replace these quantity of grain by additional shipment on their part to the soviet union

 these action will require some sacrifice on the part of all americans but there be absolutely no doubt that these action be in the interest of world peace and in the interest of the security of our own nation and they be also compatible with action be take by our own major trading partner and other who share our deep concern about this new soviet threat to world stability

 although the united states would prefer not to withdraw from the olympic game schedule in moscow this summer the soviet union must realize that its continue aggressive action will endanger both the participation of athlete and the travel to moscow by spectator who would normally wish to attend the olympic game

 along with other country we will provide military equipment food and other assistance to help pakistan defend its independence and its national security against the seriously increase threat it now face from the north the united states also stand ready to help other nation in the region in similar way

 neither our ally nor our potential adversary should have the slight doubt about our willingness our determination and our capacity to take the measure i have outline tonight i have consult with leader of the congress and i be confident they will support legislation that may be require to carry out these measure

 history teach perhaps very few clear lesson but surely one such lesson learn by the world at great cost be that aggression unopposed become a contagious disease

 the response of the international community to the soviet attempt to crush afghanistan must match the gravity of the soviet action

 with the support of the american people and work with other nation we will deter aggression we will protect our nation 's security and we will preserve the peace the united states will meet its responsibility

 thank you very much

mr. president mr. speaker member of the 96th congress fellow citizen

 this last few month have not be an easy time for any of we as we meet tonight it have never be more clear that the state of our union depend on the state of the world and tonight as throughout our own generation freedom and peace in the world depend on the state of our union

 the 1980 have be bear in turmoil strife and change this be a time of challenge to our interest and our value and it be a time that test our wisdom and our skill

 at this time in iran 50 americans be still hold captive innocent victim of terrorism and anarchy also at this moment massive soviet troop be attempt to subjugate the fiercely independent and deeply religious people of afghanistan these two act one of international terrorism and one of military aggression present a serious challenge to the united states of america and indeed to all the nation of the world together we will meet these threat to peace

 i be determined that the united states will remain the strong of all nation but our power will never be use to initiate a threat to the security of any nation or to the right of any human being we seek to be and to remain secure a nation at peace in a stable world but to be secure we must face the world as it be

 three basic development have help to shape our challenge the steady growth and increase projection of soviet military power beyond its own border the overwhelming dependence of the western democracy on oil supply from the middle east and the press of social and religious and economic and political change in the many nation of the develop world exemplify by the revolution in iran

 each of these factor be important in its own right each interact with the other all must be face together squarely and courageously we will face these challenge and we will meet they with the good that be in we and we will not fail

 in response to the abhorrent act in iran our nation have never be arouse and unify so greatly in peacetime our position be clear the united states will not yield to blackmail

 we continue to pursue these specific goal first to protect the present and long range interest of the united states secondly to preserve the life of the american hostage and to secure as quickly as possible their safe release if possible to avoid bloodshed which might far endanger the life of our fellow citizen to enlist the help of other nation in condemn this act of violence which be shocking and violate the moral and the legal standard of a civilized world and also to convince and to persuade the iranian leader that the real danger to their nation lie in the north in the soviet union and from the soviet troop now in afghanistan and that the unwarranted iranian quarrel with the united states hamper their response to this far great danger to they

 if the american hostage be harm a severe price will be pay we will never rest until every one of the american hostage be release

 but now we face a broad and more fundamental challenge in this region because of the recent military action of the soviet union

 now as during the last three and a half decade the relationship between our country the united states of america and the soviet union be the most critical factor in determine whether the world will live at peace or be engulf in global conflict

 since the end of the second world war america have lead other nation in meet the challenge of mount soviet power this have not be a simple or a static relationship between we there have be cooperation there have be competition and at time there have be confrontation

 in the 1940 we take the lead in create the atlantic alliance in response to the soviet union 's suppression and then consolidation of its east european empire and the result threat of the warsaw pact to western europe

 in the 1950 we help to contain furth soviet challenge in korea and in the middle east and we rearm to assure the continuation of that containment

 in the 1960 we meet the soviet challenge in berlin and we face the cuban missile crisis and we seek to engage the soviet union in the important task of move beyond the cold war and away from confrontation

 and in the 1970 three american presidents negotiate with the soviet leader in attempt to halt the growth of the nuclear arm race we seek to establish rule of behavior that would reduce the risk of conflict and we search for area of cooperation that could make our relation reciprocal and productive not only for the sake of our two nation but for the security and peace of the entire world

 in all these action we have maintain two commitment to be ready to meet any challenge by soviet military power and to develop way to resolve dispute and to keep the peace

 prevent nuclear war be the foremost responsibility of the two superpower that be why we have negotiate the strategic arm limitation treaty salt i and salt ii especially now in a time of great tension observe the mutual constraint impose by the term of these treaty will be in the good interest of both country and will help to preserve world peace i will consult very closely with the congress on this matter as we strive to control nuclear weapon that effort to control nuclear weapon will not be abandon

 we superpower also have the responsibility to exercise restraint in the use of our great military force the integrity and the independence of weak nation must not be threaten they must know that in our presence they be secure

 but now the soviet union have take a radical and an aggressive new step it be use its great military power against a relatively defenseless nation the implication of the soviet invasion of afghanistan could pose the most serious threat to the peace since the second world war

 the vast majority of nation on earth have condemn this late soviet attempt to extend its colonial domination of other and have demand the immediate withdrawal of soviet troop the moslem world be especially and justifiably outrage by this aggression against an islamic people no action of a world power have ever be so quickly and so overwhelmingly condemn but verbal condemnation be not enough the soviet union must pay a concrete price for their aggression

 while this invasion continue we and the other nation of the world can not conduct business as usual with the soviet union that be why the united states have impose stiff economic penalty on the soviet union i will not issue any permit for soviet ship to fish in the coastal water of the united states i have cut soviet access to high technology equipment and to agricultural product i have limit other commerce with the soviet union and i have ask our ally and friend to join with we in restrain their own trade with the soviets and not to replace our own embargoed item and i have notify the olympic committee that with soviet invade force in afghanistan neither the american people nor i will support send an olympic team to moscow

 the soviet union be go to have to answer some basic question will it help promote a more stable international environment in which its own legitimate peaceful concern can be pursue or will it continue to expand its military power far beyond its genuine security need and use that power for colonial conquest the soviet union must realize that its decision to use military force in afghanistan will be costly to every political and economic relationship it value

 the region which be now threaten by soviet troop in afghanistan be of great strategic importance it contain more than two third of the world 's exportable oil the soviet effort to dominate afghanistan have bring soviet military force to within 300 mile of the indian ocean and close to the straits of hormuz a waterway through which most of the world 's oil must flow the soviet union be now attempt to consolidate a strategic position therefore that pose a grave threat to the free movement of middle east oil

 this situation demand careful thought steady nerve and resolute action not only for this year but for many year to come it demand collective effort to meet this new threat to security in the persian gulf and in southwest asia it demand the participation of all those who rely on oil from the middle east and who be concern with global peace and stability and it demand consultation and close cooperation with country in the area which might be threaten

 meeting this challenge will take national will diplomatic and political wisdom economic sacrifice and of course military capability we must call on the good that be in we to preserve the security of this crucial region

 let our position be absolutely clear an attempt by any outside force to gain control of the persian gulf region will be regard as an assault on the vital interest of the united states of america and such an assault will be repel by any mean necessary include military force

 during the past three year you have join with i to improve our own security and the prospect for peace not only in the vital oil produce area of the persian gulf region but around the world we have increase annually our real commitment for defense and we will sustain this increase of effort throughout the five year defense program it be imperative that congress approve this strong defense budget for 1981 encompass a 5 percent real growth in authorization without any reduction

 we be also improve our capability to deploy u.s. military force rapidly to distant area we have help to strengthen nato and our other alliance and recently we and other nato member have decide to develop and to deploy modernized intermediate range nuclear force to meet an unwarranted and increase threat from the nuclear weapon of the soviet union

 we be work with our ally to prevent conflict in the middle east the peace treaty between egypt and israel be a notable achievement which represent a strategic asset for america and which also enhance prospect for regional and world peace we be now engage in further negotiation to provide full autonomy for the people of the west bank and gaza to resolve the palestinian issue in all its aspect and to preserve the peace and security of israel let no one doubt our commitment to the security of israel in a few day we will observe an historic event when israel make another major withdrawal from the sinai and when ambassadors will be exchange between israel and egypt

 we have also expand our own sphere of friendship our deep commitment to human right and to meet human need have improve our relationship with much of the third world our decision to normalize relation with the people 's republic of china will help to preserve peace and stability in asia and in the western pacific

 we have increase and strengthen our naval presence in the indian ocean and we be now make arrangement for key naval and air facility to be use by our force in the region of northeast africa and the persian gulf

 we have reconfirm our 1959 agreement to help pakistan preserve its independence and its integrity the united states will take action consistent with our own law to assist pakistan in resist any outside aggression and i be ask the congress specifically to reaffirm this agreement i be also work along with the leader of other nation to provide additional military and economic aid for pakistan that request will come to you in just a few day

 finally we be prepared to work with other country in the region to share a cooperative security framework that respect differ value and political belief yet which enhance the independence security and prosperity of all

 all these effort combine emphasize our dedication to defend and preserve the vital interest of the region and of the nation which we represent and those of our ally in europe and the pacific and also in the part of the world which have such great strategic importance to we stretch especially through the middle east and southwest asia with your help i will pursue these effort with vigor and with determination you and i will act as necessary to protect and to preserve our nation 's security

 the man and woman of america 's armed force be on duty tonight in many part of the world i be proud of the job they be do and i know you share that pride i believe that our volunteer force be adequate for current defense need and i hope that it will not become necessary to impose a draft however we must be prepare for that possibility for this reason i have determine that the selective service system must now be revitalize i will send legislation and budget proposal to the congress next month so that we can begin registration and then meet future mobilization need rapidly if they arise

 we also need clear and quick passage of a new charter to define the legal authority and accountability of our intelligence agency we will guarantee that abuse do not recur but we must tighten our control on sensitive intelligence information and we need to remove unwarranted restraint on america 's ability to collect intelligence

 the decade ahead will be a time of rapid change as nation everywhere seek to deal with new problem and age old tension but america need have no fear we can thrive in a world of change if we remain true to our value and actively engage in promote world peace we will continue to work as we have for peace in the middle east and southern africa we will continue to build our tie with develop nation respect and help to strengthen their national independence which they have struggle so hard to achieve and we will continue to support the growth of democracy and the protection of human right

 in repressive regime popular frustration often have no outlet except through violence but when people and their government can approach their problem together through open democratic method the basis for stability and peace be far more solid and far more enduring that be why our support for human right in other country be in our own national interest as well as part of our own national character

 peace a peace that preserve freedom remain america 's first goal in the come year as a mighty nation we will continue to pursue peace but to be strong abroad we must be strong at home and in order to be strong we must continue to face up to the difficult issue that confront we as a nation today

 the crisis in iran and afghanistan have dramatize a very important lesson our excessive dependence on foreign oil be a clear and present danger to our nation 's security the need have never be more urgent at long last we must have a clear comprehensive energy policy for the united states

 as you well know i have be work with the congress in a concentrated and persistent way over the past three year to meet this need we have make progress together but congress must act promptly now to complete final action on this vital energy legislation our nation will then have a major conservation effort important initiative to develop solar power realistic pricing base on the true value of oil strong incentive for the production of coal and other fossil fuel in the united states and our nation 's most massive peacetime investment in the development of synthetic fuel

 the american people be make progress in energy conservation last year we reduce overall petroleum consumption by 8 percent and gasoline consumption by 5 percent below what it be the year before now we must do more

 after consultation with the governors we will set gasoline conservation goal for each of the 50 state and i will make they mandatory if these goal be not meet

 i have establish an import ceiling for 1980 of 8.2 million barrel a day well below the level of foreign oil purchase in 1977 i expect our import to be much low than this but the ceiling will be enforce by an oil import fee if necessary i be prepared to lower these import still far if the other oil consume country will join we in a fair and mutual reduction if we have a serious shortage i will not hesitate to impose mandatory gasoline rationing immediately

 the single big factor in the inflation rate last year the increase in the inflation rate last year be from one cause the skyrocket price of opec oil we must take whatever action be necessary to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and at the same time reduce inflation

 as individual and as family few of we can produce energy by ourselves but all of we can conserve energy every one of we every day of our life tonight i call on you in fact all the people of america to help our nation conserve energy eliminate waste make 1980 indeed a year of energy conservation

 of course we must take other action to strengthen our nation 's economy

 first we will continue to reduce the deficit and then to balance the federal budget

 second as we continue to work with business to hold down price we will build also on the historic national accord with organize labor to restrain pay increase in a fair fight against inflation

 third we will continue our successful effort to cut paperwork and to dismantle unnecessary government regulation

 fourth we will continue our progress in provide job for america concentrate on a major new program to provide training and work for our young people especially minority youth it have be say that a mind be a terrible thing to waste we will give our young people new hope for job and a well life in the 1980s

 and fifth we must use the decade of the 1980 to attack the basic structural weakness and problem in our economy through measure to increase productivity saving and investment

 with these energy and economic policy we will make america even strong at home in this decade just as our foreign and defense policy will make we strong and safe throughout the world we will never abandon our struggle for a just and a decent society here at home that be the heart of america and it be the source of our ability to inspire other people to defend their own right abroad

 our material resource great as they be be limited our problem be too complex for simple slogan or for quick solution we can not solve they without effort and sacrifice walter lippmann once remind we you take the good thing for grant now you must earn they again for every right that you cherish you have a duty which you must fulfill for every good which you wish to preserve you will have to sacrifice your comfort and your ease there be nothing for nothing any long

 our challenge be formidable but there be a new spirit of unity and resolve in our country we move into the 1980 with confidence and hope and a bright vision of the america we want an america strong and free an america at peace an america with equal right for all citizen and for woman guarantee in the united states constitution an america with job and good health and good education for every citizen an america with a clean and bountiful life in our city and on our farm an america that help to feed the world an america secure in fill its own energy need an america of justice tolerance and compassion for this vision to come true we must sacrifice but this national commitment will be an exciting enterprise that will unify our people

 together as one people let we work to build our strength at home and together as one indivisible union let we seek peace and security throughout the world

 together let we make of this time of challenge and danger a decade of national resolve and of brave achievement

 thank you very much



late yesterday i cancel a carefully plan operation which be underway in iran to position our rescue team for later withdrawal of american hostage who have be hold captive there since november 4 equipment failure in the rescue helicopter make it necessary to end the mission
 as our team be withdraw after my order to do so two of our american aircraft collide on the ground follow a refueling operation in a remote desert location in iran other information about this rescue mission will be make available to the american people when it be appropriate to do so
 there be no fighting there be no combat but to my deep regret eight of the crewman of the two aircraft which collide be kill and several other americans be hurt in the accident our people be immediately airlift from iran those who be injure have get medical treatment and all of they be expect to recover
 no knowledge of this operation by any iranian official or authority be evident to we until several hour after all americans be withdraw from iran
 our rescue team know and i know that the operation be certain to be difficult and it be certain to be dangerous we be all convinced that if and when the rescue operation have be commence that it have an excellent chance of success they be all volunteer they be all highly train i meet with their leader before they go on this operation they know then what hope of mine and of all americans they carry with they
 to the family of those who die and who be wound i want to express the admiration i feel for the courage of their love one and the sorrow that i feel personally for their sacrifice
 the mission on which they be embark be a humanitarian mission it be not direct against iran it be not direct against the people of iran it be not undertake with any feeling of hostility toward iran or its people it have cause no iranian casualty
 planning for this rescue effort begin shortly after our embassy be seize but for a number of reason i wait until now to put those rescue plan into effect to be feasible this complex operation have to be the product of intensive planning and intensive training and repeat rehearsal however a resolution of this crisis through negotiation and with voluntary action on the part of the iranian official be obviously then have be and will be preferable
 this rescue attempt have to await my judgment that the iranian authority could not or would not resolve this crisis on their own initiative with the steady unraveling of authority in iran and the mount danger that be pose to the safety of the hostage themselves and the grow realization that their early release be highly unlikely i make a decision to commence the rescue operation plan
 this attempt become a necessity and a duty the readiness of our team to undertake the rescue make it completely practicable accordingly i make the decision to set our long develop plan into operation i order this rescue mission prepare in order to safeguard american life to protect america 's national interest and to reduce the tension in the world that have be cause among many nation as this crisis have continue
 it be my decision to attempt the rescue operation it be my decision to cancel it when problem develop in the placement of our rescue team for a future rescue operation the responsibility be fully my own
 in the aftermath of the attempt we continue to hold the government of iran responsible for the safety and for the early release of the american hostage who have be hold so long the united states remain determined to bring about their safe release at the early date possible
 as president i know that our entire nation feel the deep gratitude i feel for the brave man who be prepared to rescue their fellow americans from captivity and as president i also know that the nation share not only my disappointment that the rescue effort could not be mount because of mechanical difficulty but also my determination to persevere and to bring all of our hostage home to freedom
 we have be disappoint before we will not give up in our effort throughout this extraordinarily difficult period we have pursue and will continue to pursue every possible avenue to secure the release of the hostage in these effort the support of the american people and of our friend throughout the world have be a most crucial element that support of other nation be even more important now
 we will seek to continue along with other nation and with the official of iran a prompt resolution of the crisis without any loss of life and through peaceful and diplomatic mean
 thank you very much

 my fellow citizen i utterly reject that view the american people the most generous on earth who create the high standard of living be not go to accept the notion that we can only make a well world for other by move backwards ourselves those who believe we can have no business lead the nation

 i will not stand by and watch this great country destroy itself under mediocre leadership that drift from one crisis to the next erode our national will and purpose we have come together here because the american people deserve well from those to whom they entrust our nation 's high office and we stand united in our resolve to do something about it

 we need rebirth of the american tradition of leadership at every level of government and in private life as well the united states of america be unique in world history because it have a genius for leader many leader on many level but back in 1976 mr. carter say trust i and a lot of people do now many of those people be out of work many have see their saving eat away by inflation many other on fix income especially the elderly have watch helplessly as the cruel tax of inflation waste away their purchasing power and today a great many who trust mr. carter wonder if we can survive the carter policy of national defense

 trust i government ask that we concentrate our hope and dream on one man that we trust he to do what be good for we my view of government place trust not in one person or one party but in those value that transcend person and party the trust be where it belong in the people the responsibility to live up to that trust be where it belong in their elect leader that kind of relationship between the people and their elect leader be a special kind of compact

 three hundred and sixty year ago in 1620 a group of family dare to cross a mighty ocean to build a future for themselves in a new world when they arrive at plymouth massachusetts they form what they call a compact an agreement among themselves to build a community and abide by its law

 the single act the voluntary binding together of free people to live under the law set the pattern for what be to come

 a century and a half later the descendant of those people pledge their life their fortune and their sacred honor to found this nation some forfeit their fortune and their life none sacrifice honor

 four score and seven year later abraham lincoln call upon the people of all america to renew their dedication and their commitment to a government of for and by the people

 be not it once again time to renew our compact of freedom to pledge to each other all that be good in our life all that give meaning to they for the sake of this our beloved and blessed land

 together let we make this a new beginning let we make a commitment to care for the needy to teach our child the value and the virtue hand down to we by our family to have the courage to defend those value and the willingness to sacrifice for they

 let we pledge to restore in our time the american spirit of voluntary service of cooperation of private and community initiative a spirit that flow like a deep and mighty river through the history of our nation

 as your nominee i pledge to restore to the federal government the capacity to do the people 's work without dominate their life i pledge to you a government that will not only work well but wisely its ability to act temper by prudence and its willingness to do good balance by the knowledge that government be never more dangerous than when our desire to have it help we blind we to its great power to harm we

 the first republican president once say while the people retain their virtue and their vigilance no administration by any extreme of wickedness or folly can seriously injure the government in the short space of four year

 if mr. lincoln could see what be happen in these last three and a half year he might hedge a little on that statement but with the virtue that our legacy as a free people and with the vigilance that sustain liberty we still have time to use our renew compact to overcome the injury that have be do to america these past three and a half year

 first we must overcome something the present administration have cook up a new and altogether indigestible economic stew one part inflation one part high unemployment one part recession one part runaway taxis one party deficit spending and season by an energy crisis it be an economic stew that have turn the national stomach

 our be not problem of abstract economic theory those be problem of flesh and blood problem that cause pain and destroy the moral fiber of real people who should not suffer the further indignity of be tell by the government that it be all somehow their fault we do not have inflation because as mr. carter say we have live too well

 the head of a government which have utterly refuse to live within its mean and which have in the last few day tell we that this year 's deficit will be $ 60 billion dare to point the finger of blame at business and labor both of which have be engage in a lose struggle just try to stay even

 high taxis we be tell be somehow good for we as if when government spend our money it be not inflationary but when we spend it it be

 those who preside over the bad energy shortage in our history tell we to use less so that we will run out of oil gasoline and natural gas a little more slowly conservation be desirable of course for we must not waste energy but conservation be not the sole answer to our energy need

 america must get to work produce more energy the republican program for solve economic problem be base on growth and productivity

 large amount of oil and natural gas lie beneath our land and off our shore untouched because the present administration seem to believe the american people would rather see more regulation taxis and control than more energy

 coal offer great potential so do nuclear energy produce under rigorous safety standard it could supply electricity for thousand of industry and million of job and home it must not be thwart by a tiny minority oppose to economic growth which often find friendly ear in regulatory agency for its obstructionist campaign

 make no mistake we will not permit the safety of our people or our environment heritage to be jeopardize but we be go to reaffirm that the economic prosperity of our people be a fundamental part of our environment

 our problem be both acute and chronic yet all we hear from those in position of leadership be the same tired proposal for more government tinker more meddling and more control all of which lead we to this state in the first place

 can anyone look at the record of this administration and say well do can anyone compare the state of our economy when the carter administration take office with where we be today and say keep up the good work can anyone look at our reduce standing in the world today and say let us have four more year of this

 i believe the american people be go to answer these question the first week of november and their answer will be no we've have enough and then it will be up to we begin next january 20th to offer an administration and congressional leadership of competence and more than a little courage

 we must have the clarity of vision to see the difference between what be essential and what be merely desirable and then the courage to bring our government back under control and make it acceptable to the people

 it be essential that we maintain both the forward momentum of economic growth and the strength of the safety net beneath those in society who need help we also believe it be essential that the integrity of all aspect of social security be preserve

 beyond these essential i believe it be clear our federal government be overgrown and overweight indeed it be time for our government to go on a diet therefore my first act as chief executive will be to impose an immediate and thorough freeze on federal hiring then we be go to enlist the very good mind from business labor and whatever quarter to conduct a detailed review of every department bureau and agency that live by federal appropriation we be also go to enlist the help and idea of many dedicated and hard work government employee at all level who want a more efficient government as much as the rest of we do i know that many be demoralize by the confusion and waste they confront in their work as a result of fail and fail policy

 our instruction to the group we enlist will be simple and direct we will remind they that government program exist at the sufferance of the american taxpayer and be pay for with money earn by work man and woman any program that represent a waste of their money a theft from their pocketbook must have that waste eliminate or the program must go by executive order where possible by congressional action where necessary everything that can be run more effectively by state and local government we shall turn over to state and local government along with the funding source to pay for it we be go to put an end to the money merry go round where our money become washington 's money to be spend by the state and city exactly the way the federal bureaucrat tell they to

 i will not accept the excuse that the federal government have grow so big and powerful that it be beyond the control of any president any administration or congress we be go to put an end to the notion that the american taxpayer exist to fund the federal government the federal government exist to serve the american people on january 20th we be go to re establish that truth

 also on that date we be go to initiate action to get substantial relief for our taxpaye citizen and action to put people back to work none of this will be base on any new form of monetary tinkering or fiscal sleight of hand we will simply apply to government the common sense we all use in our daily life

 work and family be at the center of our life the foundation of our dignity as a free people when we deprive people of what they have earn or take away their job we destroy their dignity and undermine their family we can not support our family unless there be job and we can not have job unless people have both money to invest and the faith to invest it

 there be concept that stem from an economic system that for more than 200 year have help we master a continent create a previously undreame of prosperity for our people and have feed million of other around the globe that system will continue to serve we in the future if our government will stop ignore the basic value on which it be build and stop betray the trust and good will of the american worker who keep it go

 the american people be carry the heavy peacetime tax burden in our nation 's history and it will grow even heavy under present law next january we be tax ourselves into economic exhaustion and stagnation crush our ability and incentive to save invest and produce

 this must stop we must halt this fiscal self destruction and restore sanity to our economic system

 i have long advocate a 30 percent reduction in income tax rate over a period of three year this phase tax reduction would begin with a 10 percent down payment tax cut in 1981 which the republicans and congress and i have already propose

 a phase reduction of tax rate would go a long way toward ease the heavy burden on the american people but we should not stop here

 within the context of economic condition and appropriate budget priority during each fiscal year of my presidency i would strive to go far this would include improvement in business depreciation taxis so we can stimulate investment in order to get plant and equipment replace put more americans back to work and put our nation back on the road to be competitive in world commerce we will also work to reduce the cost of government as a percentage of our gross national product

 the first task of national leadership be to set honest and realistic priority in our policy and our budget and i pledge that my administration will do that

 when i talk of tax cut i be remind that every major tax cut in this century have strengthen the economy generate renew productivity and end up yield new revenue for the government by create new investment new job and more commerce among our people

 the present administration have be force by we republicans to play follow the leader with regard to a tax cut but in this election year we must take with the proverbial grain of salt any tax cut propose by those who have give we the great tax increase in our history when those in leadership give we tax increase and tell we we must also do with less have they think about those who have always have less especially the minority this be like tell they that just as they step on the first rung of the ladder of opportunity the ladder be be pull out from under they that may be the democratic leadership 's message to the minority but it will not be ours our message will be we have to move ahead but we be not go to leave anyone behind thank to the economic policy of the democratic party million of americans find themselves out of work million more have never even have a fair chance to learn new skill hold a decent job or secure for themselves and their family a share in the prosperity of this nation

 it be time to put america back to work to make our city and town resound with the confident voice of man and woman of all race nationality and faith bring home to their family a decent paycheck they can cash for honest money

 for those without skill we will find a way to help they get skill

 for those without job opportunity we will stimulate new opportunity particularly in the inner city where they live

 for those who have abandon hope we will restore hope and we will welcome they into a great national crusade to make america great again

 when we move from domestic affair and cast our eye abroad we see an equally sorry chapter on the record of the present administration

 as soviet combat brigade train in cuba just 90 mile from our shore

 a soviet army of invasion occupy afghanistan far threaten our vital interest in the middle east

 america 's defense strength be at its low ebb in a generation while the soviet union be vastly outspende we in both strategic and conventional arm

 our european ally look nervously at the grow menace from the east turn to we for leadership and fail to find it

 and incredibly more than 50 of our fellow americans have be hold captive for over eight month by a dictatorial foreign power that hold we up to ridicule before the world

 adversary large and small test our will and seek to confound our resolve but we be give weakness when we need strength vacillation when the time demand firmness

 the carter administration live in the world of make believe every day draw up a response to that day 's problem trouble regardless of what happen yesterday and what will happen tomorrow

 the rest of we however live in the real world it be here that disaster be overtake our nation without any real response from washington

 this be make believe self deceit and above all transparent hypocrisy

 for example mr. carter say he support the volunteer army but he let military pay and benefit slip so low that many of our enlisted personnel be actually eligible for food stamp re enlistment rate drop and just recently after he fight all week against a proposal to increase the pay of our man and woman in uniform he helicoptere to our carrier the u.s.s. nimitz which be return from long month of duty he tell the crew that he advocate well pay for they and their comrade where do he really stand now that he be back on shore

 i will tell you where i stand i do not favor a peacetime draft or registration but i do favor pay and benefit level that will attract and keep highly motivated man and woman in our volunteer force and an active reserve train and ready for an instant call in case of an emergency

 there may be a sailor at the helm of the ship of state but the ship have no rudder critical decision be make at time almost in comic fashion but who can laugh who be not embarrassed when the administration hand a major propaganda victory in the united nations to the enemy of israel our staunch middle east ally for three decade and they claim that the american vote be a mistake the result of a failure of communication between the president his secretary of state and his u.n. ambassador

 who do not feel a grow sense of unease as our ally face repeat instance of an amateurish and confused administration reluctantly conclude that america be unwilling or unable to fulfill its obligation as the leader of the free world

 who do not feel rise alarm when the question in any discussion of foreign policy be no long should we do something but do we have the capacity to do anything

 the administration which have bring we to this state be seek your endorsement for four more year of weakness indecision mediocrity and incompetence no american should vote until he or she have ask be the united states strong and more respected now than it be three and a half year ago be the world today a safe place in which to live

 it be the responsibility of the president of the united states in work for peace to insure that the safety of our people can not successfully be threaten by a hostile foreign power as president fulfil that responsibility will be my number one priority

 we be not a warlike people quite the opposite we always seek to live in peace we resort to force infrequently and with great reluctance and only after we have determine that it be absolutely necessary we be awed and rightly so by the force of destruction at loose in the world in this nuclear era but neither can we be naive or foolish four time in my lifetime america have go to war bleed the life of its young man into the sand of beachhead the field of europe and the jungle and rice paddy of asia we know only too well that war come not when the force of freedom be strong but when they be weak it be then that tyrant be tempt

 we simply can not learn these lesson the hard way again without risk our destruction

 of all the objective we seek first and foremost be the establishment of last world peace we must always stand ready to negotiate in good faith ready to pursue any reasonable avenue that hold forth the promise of lessen tension and further the prospect of peace but let our friend and those who may wish we ill take note the united states have an obligation to its citizen and to the people of the world never to let those who would destroy freedom dictate the future course of human life on this planet i would regard my election as proof that we have renew our resolve to preserve world peace and freedom this nation will once again be strong enough to do that

 this evening mark the last step save one of a campaign that have take nancy and i from one end of this great land to the other over many month and thousand of mile there be those who question the way we choose a president who say that our process impose difficult and exhausting burden on those who seek the office i have not find it so

 it be impossible to capture in word the splendor of this vast continent which god have grant as our portion of this creation there be no word to express the extraordinary strength and character of this breed of people we call americans

 everywhere we have meet thousand of democrats independents and republicans from all economic condition and walk of life bind together in that community of share value of family work neighborhood peace and freedom they be concern yes but they be not frightened they be disturb but not dismayed they be the kind of man and woman tom paine have in mind when he write during the dark day of the american revolution--"we have it in our power to begin the world over again

 nearly 150 year after tom paine write those word an american president tell the generation of the great depression that it have a rendezvous with destiny i believe that this generation of americans today have a rendezvous with destiny

 tonight let we dedicate ourselves to renew the american compact i ask you not simply to trust i but to trust your value our value and to hold i responsible for live up to they i ask you to trust that american spirit which know no ethnic religious social political regional or economic boundary the spirit that burn with zeal in the heart of million of immigrant from every corner of the earth who come here in search of freedom

 some say that spirit no long exist but i have see it i have feel it all across the land in the big city the small town and in rural america the american spirit be still there ready to blaze into life if you and i be willing to do what have to be do the practical down to earth thing that will stimulate our economy increase productivity and put america back to work the time be now to resolve that the basis of a firm and principled foreign policy be one that take the world as it be and seek to change it by leadership and example not by harangue harassment or wishful thinking

 the time be now to say that while we shall seek new friendship and expand and improve other we shall not do so by break our word or cast aside old friend and ally

 and the time be now to redeem promise once make to the american people by another candidate in another time and another place he say for three long year i have be go up and down this country preach that government federal state and local cost too much i shall not stop that preach as an immediate program of action we must abolish useless office we must eliminate unnecessary function of government we must consolidate subdivision of government and like the private citizen give up luxury which we can no long afford

 i propose to you my friend and through you that government of all kind big and little be make solvent and that the example be set by the president of the united state and his cabinet

 so say franklin delano roosevelt in his acceptance speech to the democratic national convention in july 1932

 the time be now my fellow americans to recapture our destiny to take it into our own hand but to do this will take many of we work together i ask you tonight to volunteer your help in this cause so we can carry our message throughout the land

 yes be not now the time that we the people carry out these unkempt promise let we pledge to each other and to all america on this july day 48 year later we intend to do just that

 i have think of something that be not part of my speech and i be worried over whether i should do it

 can we doubt that only a divine providence place this land this island of freedom here as a refuge for all those people in the world who yearn to breathe freely jews and christians endure persecution behind the iron curtain the boat people of southeast asia of cuba and haiti the victim of drought and famine in africa the freedom fighter of afghanistan and our own countryman hold in savage captivity

 i will confess that i have be a little afraid to suggest what i be go to suggest i be more afraid not to that we begin our crusade join together in a moment of silent prayer god bless america

fellow democrats fellow citizen

 i thank you for the nomination you have offer i and i especially thank you for choose as my running mate the good partner any president ever have fritz mondale

 with gratitude and with determination i accept your nomination and i be proud to run on the progressive and sound platform that you have hammer out at this convention

 fritz and i will mount a campaign that define the real issue a campaign that respond to the intelligence of the american people a campaign that talk sense and we be go to beat the republicans in november

 we will win because we be the party of a great president who know how to get reelect franklin delano roosevelt and we be the party of a courageous fighter who know how to give them hell harry truman and as truman say he just tell the truth and they think it be hell and we be the party of a gallant man of spirit john fitzgerald kennedy and we be the party of a great leader of compassion lyndon baines johnson and the party of a great man who should have be president who would have be one of the great president in history hubert horatio hornblower humphrey i have appreciate what this convention have say about senator humphrey a great man who epitomize the spirit of the democratic party and i would like to say that we be also the party of governor jerry brown and senator edward kennedy

 i would like to say a personal word to senator kennedy ted you be a tough competitor and a superb campaigner and i can attest to that your speech before this convention be a magnificent statement of what the democratic party be and what it mean to the people of this country and why a democratic victory be so important this year i reach out to you tonight and i reach out to all those who support you in your valiant and passionate campaign ted your party need and i need you and i need your idealism and your dedication work for we there be no doubt that even great service lie ahead of you and we be grateful to you and to have your strong partnership now in a large cause to which your own life have be dedicate

 i thank you for your support we will make great partner this fall in whip the republicans we be democrats and we have have our difference but we share a bright vision of america 's future a vision of a good life for all our people a vision of a secure nation a just society a peaceful world a strong america confident and proud and united and we have a memory of franklin roosevelt 40 year ago when he say that there be time in our history when concern over our personal life be overshadow by our concern over what will happen to the county we have know this be such a time and i can tell you that the choice to be make this year can transform our own personal life and the life of our country as well

 during the last presidential campaign i crisscross this country and i listen to thousand and thousand of people housewife and farmer teacher and small business leader worker and student the elderly and the poor people of every race and every background and every walk of life it be a powerful experience a total immersion in the human reality of america

 and i have now have another kind of total immersion be president of the united states of america let i talk for a moment about what that job be like and what i have learn from it

 i have learn that only the most complex and difficult task come before i in the oval office no easy answer be find there because no easy question come there

 i have learn that for a president experience be the good guide to the right decision i be wise tonight than i be 4 year ago

 and i have learn that the presidency be a place of compassion my own heart be burden for the troubled americans the poor and the jobless and the afflict they've become part of i my thought and my prayer for our hostage in iran be as though they be my own son and daughter

 the life of every human being on earth can depend on the experience and judgment and vigilance of the person in the oval office the president 's power for building and his power for destruction be awesome and the power 's great exactly where the stake be high in matter of war and peace

 and i have learn something else something that i have come to see with extraordinary clarity above all i must look ahead because the president of the united states be the steward of the nation 's destiny he must protect our child and the child they will have and the child of generation to follow he must speak and act for they that be his burden and his glory

 and that be why a president can not yield to the shortsighted demand no matter how rich or powerful the special interest might be that make those demand and that be why the president can not bend to the passion of the moment however popular they might be that be why the president must sometimes ask for sacrifice when his listener would rather hear the promise of comfort

 the president be a servant of today but his true constituency be the future that be why the election of 1980 be so important

 some have say it make no difference who win this election they be wrong this election be a stark choice between two man two party two sharply different picture of what america be and what the world be but it be more than that it be a choice between two future

 the year 2000 be just less than 20 year away just four presidential election after this one child bear this year will come of age in the 21st century the time to shape the world of the year 2000 be now the decision of the next few year will set our course perhaps an irreversible course and the most important of all choice will be make by the american people at the poll less than 3 month from tonight

 the choice could not be more clear nor the consequence more crucial in one of the future we can choose the future that you and i have be build together i see security and justice and peace

 i see a future of economic security security that will come from tap our own great resource of oil and gas coal and sunlight and from build the tool and technology and factory for a revitalize economy base on job and stable price for everyone

 i see a future of justice the justice of good job decent health care quality education a full opportunity for all people regardless of color or language or religion the simple human justice of equal right for all man and for all woman guarantee equal right at last under the constitution of the united states of america

 and i see a future of peace a peace bear of wisdom and base on a fairness toward all country of the world a peace guarantee both by american military strength and by american moral strength as well

 that be the future i want for all people a future of confidence and hope and a good life it be the future america must choose and with your help and with your commitment it be the future america will choose

 but there be another possible future in that other future i see despair despair of million who would struggle for equal opportunity and a well life and struggle alone and i see surrender the surrender of our energy future to the merchant of oil the surrender of our economic future to a bizarre program of massive tax cut for the rich service cut for the poor and massive inflation for everyone and i see risk the risk of international confrontation the risk of an uncontrollable unaffordable and unwinnable nuclear arm race

 no one democrat or republican either consciously seek such a future and i do not claim that my opponent do but i do question the disturb commitment and policy already make by he and by those with he who have now capture control of the republican party the consequence of those commitment and policy would drive we down the wrong road it be up to all of we to make sure america reject this alarming and even perilous destiny

 the only way to build a well future be to start with the reality of the present but while we democrats grapple with the real challenge of a real world other talk about a world of tinsel and make believe

 let us look for a moment at their make believe world

 in their fantasy america inner city people and farm worker and laborer do not exist woman like child be to be see but not hear the problem of work woman be simply ignore the elderly do not need medicare the young do not need more help in get a well education worker do not require the guarantee of a healthy and a safe place to work in their fantasy world all the complex global change of the world since world war ii have never happen in their fantasy america all problem have simple solution simple and wrong

 it be a make believe world a world of good guy and bad guy where some politician shoot first and ask question later no hard choice no sacrifice no tough decision it sound too good to be true and it be

 the path of fantasy lead to irresponsibility the path of reality lead to hope and peace the two path could not be more different nor could the future to which they lead let us take a hard look at the consequence of our choice

 you and i have be work toward a more secure future by rebuild our military strength steadily carefully and responsibly the republicans talk about military strength but they be in office for 8 out of the last 11 year and in the face of a grow soviet threat they steadily cut real defense spending by more than a third

 we have reverse the republican decline in defense every year since i have be president we have have real increase in our commitment to a strong nation increase which be prudent and rational there be no doubt that the united states of america can meet a threat from the soviet union our modernized strategic force a revitalize nato the trident submarine the cruise missile the rapid deployment force all these guarantee that we will never be second to any nation deed not word fact not fiction we must and we will continue to build our own defense we must and we will continue to seek balanced reduction in nuclear arm

 the new leader of the republican party in order to close the gap between their rhetoric and their record have now promise to launch an all out nuclear arm race this would negate any further effort to negotiate a strategic arm limitation agreement there can be no winner in such an arm race and all the people of the earth can be the loser

 the republican nominee advocate abandon arm control policy which have be important and support by every democratic president since harry truman and also by every republican president since dwight d. eisenhower this radical and irresponsible course would threaten our security and could put the whole world in peril you and i must never let this come to pass

 it be simple to call for a new arm race but when armed aggression threaten world peace tough sound talk like that be not enough a president must act responsibly

 when soviet troop invade afghanistan we move quickly to take action i suspend some grain sale to the soviet union i call for draft registration and i join wholeheartedly with the congress and with the u.s. olympic committee and lead more than 60 other nation in boycott the big propaganda show in russia the moscow olympics

 the republican leader oppose two of these forceful but peaceful action and he waffle on the third but when we ask he what he would do about aggression in southwest asia he suggest blockade cuba laughter even his running mate would not go along with that he do not seem to know what to do with the russians he be not sure if he want to feed they or play with they or fight with they

 as i look back at my first term i be grateful that we have have a country for the full 4 year of peace and that be what we be go to have for the next 4 year peace

 it be only common sense that if america be to stay secure and at peace we must encourage other to be peaceful as well

 as you know we have help in zimbabwe rhodesia where we have stand firm for racial justice and democracy and we have also help in the middle east

 some have criticize the camp david accord and they have criticize some delay in the implementation of the middle east peace treaty well before i become president there be no camp david accord and there be no middle east peace treaty before camp david israel and egypt be poise across barbed wire confront each other with gun and tank and plane but afterward they talk face to face with each other across a peace table and they also communicate through their own ambassador in cairo and tel aviv

 now that be the kind of future we be offer of peace to the middle east if the democrats be reelect in the fall

 i be very proud that nearly half the aid that our country have ever give to israel in the 32 year of her existence have come during my administration unlike our republican predecessor we have never stop nor slow that aid to israel and as long as i be president we will never do so our commitment be clear security and peace for israel peace for all the people of the middle east

 but if the world be to have a future of freedom as well as peace america must continue to defend human right

 now listen to this the new republican leader oppose our human right policy they want to scrap it they seem to think it be naive for america to stand up for freedom and democracy just what do they think we should stand up for

 ask the former political prisoner who now live in freedom if we should abandon our stand on human right ask the dissident in the soviet union about our commitment to human right ask the hungarian americans ask the polish americans listen to pope john paul ii ask those who be suffer for the sake of justice and liberty around the world ask the million who have flee tyranny if america should stop speak out for human principle ask the american people i tell you that as long as i be president we will hold high the banner of human right and you can depend on it

 here at home the choice between the two future be equally important

 in the long run nothing be more crucial to the future of america than energy nothing be so disastrously neglect in the past long after the 1973 arab oil embargo the republicans in the white house have still do nothing to meet the threat to the national security of our nation then as now their policy be dictate by the big oil company

 we democrats fight hard to rally our nation behind a comprehensive energy policy and a good program a new foundation for challenging and exciting progress now after 3 year of struggle we have that program the battle to secure america 's energy future have be fully and finally join americans have cooperate with dramatic result we have reverse decade of dangerous and grow dependence on foreign oil we be now import 20 percent less oil that be 1 1/2 million barrel of oil every day less than the day i take office

 and with our new energy policy now in place we can discover more produce more create more and conserve more energy and we will use american resource american technology and million of american worker to do it with

 now what do the republicans propose basically their energy program have two part the first part be to get rid of almost everything that we have do for the american public in the last 3 year they want to reduce or abolish the synthetic fuel program they want to slash the solar energy incentive the conservation program aid to mass transit aid to elderly americans to help pay their fuel bill they want to eliminate the 55 mile speed limit and while they be at it the republicans would like to gut the clean air act they never like it to begin with

 that be one part of their program the other part be bad to replace what we have build this be what they propose to destroy the windfall profit tax and to unleash the oil company and let they solve the energy problem for we that be it that be it that be their whole program there be no more can this nation accept such an outrageous program
 audience no

 the president no we democrats will fight it every step of the way and we will begin tomorrow morning with a campaign for reelection in november

 when i take office i inherit a heavy load of serious economic problem besides energy and we have meet they all head on we have slash government regulation and put free enterprise back into the airline the trucking and the financial system of our country and we be now do the same thing for the railroad this be the great change in the relationship between government and business since the new deal we have increase our export dramatically we have reverse the decline in the basic research and development and we have create more than 8 million new job the big increase in the history of our country

 but the road be bumpy and last year 's skyrocket opec price increase have help to trigger a worldwide inflation crisis we take forceful action and interest rate have now fall the dollar be stable and although we still have a battle on our hand we be struggle to bring inflation under control

 we be now at the critical point a turning point in our economic history of our country but because we make the hard decision because we have guide our nation and its economy through a rough but essential period of transition we have lay the groundwork for a new economic age

 our economic renewal program for the 1980 's will meet our immediate need for job and attack the very same long range problem that cause unemployment and inflation in the first place it will move america simultaneously towards our five great economic goal low inflation well productivity revitalization of american industry energy security and job

 it be time to put all america back to work but not in make work in real work and there be real work in modernize american industry and create new industry for america as well here be just a few thing we will rebuild together and build together
 new industry to turn our own coal and shale and farm product into fuel for our car and truck and to turn the light of the sun into heat and electricity for our home
 a modern transportation system of railbed and port to make american coal into a powerful rival of opec oil
 industry that will provide the convenience of futuristic computer technology and communication to serve million of american home and office and factory
 job training for worker displace by economic change
 new investment pinpoint in region and community where job be need most
 well mass transit in our city and in between city
 and a whole new generation of american job to make home and vehicle and building that will house we and move we in comfort with a lot less energy

 this be important too i have no doubt that the ingenuity and dedication of the american people can make every single one of these thing happen we be talk about the united states of america and those who count this country out as an economic superpower be go to find out just how wrong they be we be go to share in the exciting enterprise of make the 1980 's a time of growth for america

 the republican alternative be the big tax giveaway in history they call it reagan kemp roth i call it a free lunch that americans can not afford the republican tax program offer rebate to the rich deprivation for the poor and fierce inflation for all of we their party 's own vice presidential nominee say that reagan kemp roth would result in an inflation rate of more than 30 percent he call it voodoo economic he suddenly change his mind toward the end of the republican convention but he be right the first time

 along with this gigantic tax cut the new republican leader promise to protect retirement and health program and to have massive increase in defense spending and they claim they can balance the budget if they be serious about these promise and they say they be then a close analysis show that the entire rest of the government would have to be abolish everything from education to farm program from the g.i. bill to the night watchman at the lincoln memorial and their budget would still be in the red the only alternative would be to build more printing press to print cheap money either way the american people lose but the american people will not stand for it

 the democratic party have always embody the hope of our people for justice opportunity and a well life and we have work in every way possible to strengthen the american family to encourage self reliance and to follow the old testament admonition defend the poor and the fatherless give justice to the afflicted and needy we have struggle to assure that no child in america ever go to bed hungry that no elderly couple in america have to live in a substandard home and that no young person in america be exclude from college because the family be poor

 but what have the republicans proposed?—just an attack on everything that we have do in the achievement of social justice and decency that we have win in the last 50 year ever since franklin delano roosevelt 's first term they would make social security voluntary they would reverse our progress on the minimum wage full employment law safety in the work place and a healthy environment

 lately as you know the republicans have be quote democratic presidents but who can blame they would you rather quote herbert hoover or franklin delano roosevelt would you rather quote richard nixon or john fitzgerald kennedy

 the republicans have always be the party of privilege but this year their leader have go even far in their platform they have repudiate the good tradition of their own party where be the conscience of lincoln in the party of lincoln what be become of their traditional republican commitment to fiscal responsibility what be happen to their commitment to a safe and sane arm control

 now i do not claim perfection for the democratic party i do not claim that every decision that we have make have be right or popular certainly they have not all be easy but i will say this we have be test under fire we have neither duck nor hide and we have tackle the great central issue of our time the historic challenge of peace and energy which have be ignore for year we have make tough decision and we have take the heat for they we have make mistake and we have learn from they but we have build the foundation now for a well future

 we have do something else perhaps even more important in good time and bad in the valley and on the peak we have tell people the truth the hard truth the truth that sometimes hurt

 one truth that we americans have learn be that our dream have be earn for progress and for peace look what our land have be through within our own memory a great depression a world war a technological explosion the civil right revolution the bitterness of vietnam the shame of watergate the twilight peace of nuclear terror

 through each of these momentous experience we have learn the hard way about the world and about ourselves but we have mature and we have grow as a nation and we have grow strong

 we have learn the use and the limitation of power we have learn the beauty and responsibility of freedom we have learn the value and the obligation of justice and we have learn the necessity of peace

 some would argue that to master these lesson be somehow to limit our potential that be not so a nation which know its true strength which see its true challenge which understand legitimate constraint that nation our nation be far strong than one which take refuge in wishful thinking or nostalgia the democratic party the american people have understand these fundamental truth

 all of we can sympathize with the desire for easy answer there be often the temptation to substitute idle dream for hard reality the new republican leader be hope that our nation will succumb to that temptation this year but they profoundly misunderstand and underestimate the character of the american people

 three week after pearl harbor winston churchill come to north america and he say we have not journey all this way across the century across the ocean across the mountain across the prairie because we be make of sugar candy we americans have courage americans have always be on the cutting edge of change we have always look forward with anticipation and confidence

 i still want the same thing that all of you want a self reliant neighborhood strong family work for the able bodied and good medical care for the sick opportunity for our youth and dignity for our old equal right and justice for all people

 i want teacher eager to explain what a civilization really be and i want student to understand their own need and their own aim but also the need and yearning of their neighbor

 i want woman free to pursue without limit the full life of what they want for themselves

 i want our farmer grow crop to feed our nation and the world secure in the knowledge that the family farm will thrive and with a fair return on the good work they do for all of we

 i want worker to see meaning in the labor they perform and work enough to guarantee a job for every worker in this country

 and i want the people in business free to pursue with boldness and freedom new idea

 and i want minority citizen fully to join the mainstream of american life and i want from the bottom of my heart to remove the blight of racial and other discrimination from the face of our nation and i be determined to do it

 i need for all of you to join i in fulfil that vision the choice the choice between the two future could not be more clear if we succumb to a dream world then we will wake up to a nightmare but if we start with reality and fight to make our dream a reality then americans will have a good life a life of meaning and purpose in a nation that be strong and secure

 above all i want we to be what the founder of our nation mean we to become the land of freedom the land of peace and the land of hope

 thank you very much

mr smith the league of women voters be pleased to welcome to the cleveland ohio convention center music hall president jimmy carter the democratic party 's candidate for reelection to the presidency and governor ronald reagan of california the republican party 's candidate for the presidency the candidate will debate question on domestic economic foreign policy and national security issue

 the question be go to be pose by a panel of distinguished journalist who be here with i they be marvin stone the editor of u.s. news and world report harry ellis national correspondent of the christian science monitor william hilliard assistant manage editor of the portland oregonian barbara walters correspondent abc news

 the ground rule for this as agree by you gentleman be these each panelist down here will ask a question the same question to each of the two candidate after the two candidate have answer a panelist will ask followup question to try to sharpen the answer the candidate will then have an opportunity each to make a rebuttal that will constitute the first half of the debate and i will state the rule for the second half later on

 some other rule the candidate be not permit to bring prepared note to the podium but be permit to make note during the debate if the candidate exceed the allotted time agree on i will reluctantly but certainly interrupt we ask the convention center audience here to abide by one ground rule please do not applaud or express approval or disapproval during the debate

 now base on a toss of the coin governor reagan will respond to the first question from marvin stone

 u.s. armed forces

 mr stone governor as you be well aware the question of war and peace have emerge as a central issue in this campaign in the give and take of recent week president carter 's be criticize for respond late to aggressive soviet impulse for insufficient buildup of our armed forces and a paralysis in deal with afghanistan and iran you have be criticize for be all too quick to advocate the use of lot of muscle military action to deal with foreign crisis specifically what be the difference between the two of you on the use of american military power

 governor reagan i do not know what the difference might be because i do not know what mr. carter 's policy be i do know what he have say about mine and i be only here to tell you that i believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace and that use of force be always and only a last resort when everything else have fail and then only with regard to our national security

 now i believe also that this meeting this mission this responsibility for preserve the peace which i believe be a responsibility peculiar to our country that we can not shirk our responsibility as the leader of the free world because we be the only one that can do it and therefore the burden of maintain the peace fall on we and to maintain that peace require strength america have never get in a war because we be too strong we can get into a war by let event get out of hand as they have in the last 3 year under the foreign policy of this administration of mr. carter 's until we be face each time with a crisis and good management in preserve the peace require that we control the event and try to intercept before they become a crisis

 but i have see four war in my lifetime i be a father of son i have a grandson i do not ever want to see another generation of young americans bleed their life into sandy beachhead in the pacific or rice paddy and jungle in asia or the muddy bloody battlefield of europe

 mr smith mr. stone do you have a followup question for the governor

 mr stone yes governor we have be hear that the defense buildup that you would associate yourself with would cost ten of billion of dollar more than be now contemplate in assume that the american people be ready to bear this cost they nevertheless keep ask the following question how do you reconcile huge increase in military outlay with your promise of substantial tax cut and of balance the budget which in this fiscal year the one that just end run more than $ 60 billion in the red

 governor reagan mr. stone i have submit an economic plan that i have work out in concert with a number of fine economist in this country all of whom approve it and believe that over a 5 year projection this plan can permit the extra spending for needed refurbishing of our defensive posture that it can provide for a balanced budget by 1983 if not early and that we can afford along with the cut that i have propose in government spending we can afford the tax cut i have propose and probably mainly because mr. carter 's economic policy have build into the next 5 year and on beyond that a tax increase that will be take $ 86 billion more next year out of the people 's pocket than be take this year and my tax cut do not come close to eliminate that $ 86 billion increase i be only reduce the amount of the increase

 in other word what i be talk about be not put government back to get less money than government 's be get but simply cut the increase in spending

 mr smith the same question now go to president garter president carter would you like to have the question repeat

 the president yes

 mr stone yes president carter the question of war and peace a central issue in this campaign you have be criticize in the give and take for respond late to aggressive soviet impulse for an insufficient buildup of our armed forces and a paralysis in deal with afghanistan and iran governor reagan on the other hand have be criticize for be all too quick to advocate the use of lot of muscle military action to deal with foreign crisis such as i mention specifically what be the difference between the two of you on the use of american military power

 the president mr. stone i have have to make thousand of decision since i have be president serve in the oval office and with each one of those decision that affect the future of my country i have learn in the process i think i be a much wise and more experienced man than i be when i debate 4 year ago against president ford i have also learn that there be no simple answer to complicated question h. l. mencken say that for every problem there be a simple answer it would be neat and plausible and wrong

 the fact be that this nation in the 8 year before i become president have its own military strength decrease seven out of eight year the budget commitment for defense go down 37 percent in all since i have be in office we have have a steady carefully plan methodical but very effective increase in our commitment for defense

 but what we have do be to use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the united states to preserve the peace we have not only keep peace for our own country but we have be able to extend the benefit of peace to other in the middle east we have work for a peace treaty between israel and egypt successfully and have tie ourselves together with israel and egypt in a common defense capability this be a very good step forward for our nation 's security and we will continue to do as we have do in the past

 i might also add that there be decision that be make in the oval office by every president which be profound in nature there be always troublespot in the world and how those troubled area be address by a president alone in that oval office affect our nation directly the involvement of the united states and also our american interest that be a basic decision that have to be make so frequently by every president who serve that be what i have try to do successfully by keep our country at peace

 mr smith mr. stone do you have a followup on

 mr stone yes i would like to be a little more specific on the use of military power and let us talk about one area for a moment

 under what circumstance would you use military force to deal with for example a shutoff of persian oil gulf if that should occur or to counter russian expansion beyond afghanistan into either iran or pakistan i ask this question in view of charge that we be woefully unprepared to project sustain and i emphasize the word sustain power in that part of the world

 the president mr. stone in my state of the union address early this year i point out that any threat to the stability or security of the persian gulf would be a threat to the security of our own country in the past we have not have an adequate military presence in that region now we have two major carrier task force we have access to facility in five different area of that region and we have make it clear that work with our ally and other that we be prepared to address any foreseeable eventuality which might interrupt commerce with that crucial area of the world

 but in do this we have make sure that we address this question peacefully not inject american military force into combat but let the strength of our nation be feel in a beneficial way this i believe have assure that our interest will be protect in the persian gulf region as we have do in the middle east and throughout the world

 mr smith governor reagan you have a minute to comment or rebut

 governor reagan well yes i question the figure about the decline in defense spending under the two previous administration in the precede 8 year to this administration i would call to your attention that we be in a war that wind down during those 8 year which of course make a change in military spending because of turn from war to peace i also would like to point out that republican presidents in those year face with a democratic majority in both houses of the congress find that their request for defense budget be very often cut

 now gerald ford leave a 5 year project plan for a military buildup to restore our defense and president garter 's administration reduce that by 38 percent cut 60 ship out of the navy building program that have be propose and stop the b-1 delay the cruise missile stop the production line for the minuteman missile delay the trident submarine and now be plan a mobile military force that can be deliver to various spot in the world which do make i question his assault on whether i be the one that be quick to look for use of force

 mr smith president carter you have the last word on this question

 the president well there be various element of defense one be to control nuclear weapon which i hope we will get to later on because that be the most important single issue in this campaign another one be how to address troubled area of the world i think habitually governor reagan have advocate the injection of military force into troubled area when i and my predecessor both democrats and republicans have advocate resolve those trouble and those difficult area of the world peacefully diplomatically and through negotiation

 in addition to that the buildup of military force be good for our country because we have get to have military strength in order to preserve the peace but i will always remember that the good weapon be the one that be never fire in combat and the good soldier be one who never have to lay his life down on the field of battle strength be imperative for peace but the two must go hand in hand

 mr smith thank you gentleman the next question be from harry ellis to president carter

 the nation 's economy

 mr ellis mr. president when you be elect in 1976 the consumer price index stand at 4.8 percent it now stand at more than 12 percent perhaps more significantly the nation 's broad underlie inflation rate have go up from 7 to 9 percent now a part of that be due to external factor beyond u.s. control notably the more than double of oil price by opec last year

 because the united states remain vulnerable to such external shock can inflation in fact be control if so what measure would you pursue in a second term

 the president again it be important to put the situation into perspective in 1974 we have a so call oil shock wherein the price of opec oil be raise to an extraordinary degree we have an even bad oil shock in 1979 in 1974 we have the bad recession the deep and most penetrate recession since the second world war the recession that result this time be the brief we have have since the second world war

 in addition we have bring down inflation early this year the first quarter we do have a very severe inflation pressure bring about by the opec price increase it average about 18 percent the first quarter of this year the second quarter we have drop it down to about 13 percent the most recent figure the last 3 month or the third quarter of this year the inflation rate be 7 percent still too high but it illustrate very vividly that in addition to provide an enormous number of job 9 million new job in the last 3 1/2 year that the inflationary threat be still urgent on we

 i notice that governor reagan recently mention the reagan kemp roth proposal which his own running mate george bush describe as voodoo economic and say that it would result in a 30 percent inflation rate and business week which be not a democratic publication say that this reagan kemp roth proposal and i quote they i think be completely irresponsible and would result in inflationary pressure which would destroy this nation

 so our proposal be very sound and very carefully consider to stimulate job to improve the industrial complex of this country to create tool for american worker and at the same time would be anti inflationary in nature so to add 9 million new job to control inflation and to plan for the future with the energy policy now intact as a foundation be our plan for the year ahead

 mr smith mr. ellis do you have a followup question for mr. carter

 mr ellis yes mr. president you have mention the creation of 9 million new job

 the president yes

 mr ellis at the same time the unemployment rate still hang high as do the inflation rate now i wonder can you tell we what additional policy you would pursue in a second administration in order to try to bring down that inflation rate and would it be an act of leadership to tell the american people they be go to have to sacrifice to adopt a lean lifestyle for some time to come

 the president yes we have demand that the american people sacrifice and they have do very well as a matter of fact we be import today about one third less oil from overseas than we do just a year ago we have have a 25 percent reduction since the first year i be in office at the same time as i say early we have add about 9 million net new job in that period of time a record never before achieve

 also the new energy policy have be predicate on two factor one conservation which require sacrifice and the other one increase in production of american energy which be go along very well more coal this year than ever before in history more oil and gas well drill this year than ever before in history

 the new economic revitalization program that we have in mind which will be implement next year would result in tax credit which would let business invest in new tool and new factory to create even more new job about a million in the next 2 year and we also have plan a youth employment program which would encompass 600,000 job for young people this have already pass the house now have an excellent prospect to pass the senate

 mr smith now the same question go to governor reagan governor reagan would you like to have the question repeat

 governor reagan yes please

 mr ellis governor reagan during the past 4 year the consumer price index have rise from 4.8 percent to currently over 12 percent and perhaps more significantly the nation 's broad underlying rate of inflation have go up from 7 to 9 percent now a part of that have be due to external factor beyond u.s. control and notably the more than double of opec oil price last year which lead i to ask you whether since the united states remain vulnerable to such external shock can inflation in fact be control if so specifically what measure would you pursue

 governor reagan mr. ellis i think this idea that have be spawn here in our country that inflation somehow come upon we like a plague and therefore it be uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it be entirely spurious and it be dangerous to say this to the people when mr. carter become president inflation be 4.8 percent as you say it have be cut in two by president gerald ford it be now run at 12.7 percent

 president carter also have speak of the new job create well we always with the normal growth in our country and increase in population increase the number of job but that can not hide the fact that there be 8 million man and woman out of work in america today and 2 million of those lose their job in just the last few month mr. carter have also promise that he would not use unemployment as a tool to fight against inflation and yet his 1980 economic message state that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation because in january at the beginning of the year it be more than 18 percent

 since then he have blame to the people for inflation opec he be blame the federal reserve system he have blame the lack of productivity of the american people he have then accuse the people of live too well and that we must share in scarcity we must sacrifice and get use to do with less we do not have inflation because the people be live too well we have inflation because the government be live too well

 and the last statement just a few day ago be a speech to the effect that we have inflation because government revenue have not keep pace with government spending i see my time be run out here i will have to get this down very fast

 yes you can lick inflation by increase productivity and by decrease the cost of government to the place that we have balanced budget and be no long grind out print press money flood the market with it because the government be spend more than it take in and my economic plan call for that

 the president 's economic plan call for increase the taxis to the point that we finally take so much money away from the people that we can balance the budget in that way but we will have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path

 mr smith a followup mr. ellis

 mr ellis yes you have center on cut government spending in what you have just say about your own policy you have also say that you would increase defense spending specifically where would you cut government spending if you be to increase defense spending and also cut taxis so that presumably federal revenue would shrink

 governor reagan well most people when they think about cut government spending they think in term of eliminate necessary program or wipe out something some service that government be suppose to perform i believe that there be enough extravagance and fat in government as a matter of fact one of the secretaries of hew under mr. carter testify that he think there be $ 7 billion worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical program associate with it we have have the general accounting office estimate that there be probably ten of billion of dollar that be lose in fraud alone and they have add that waste add even more to that

 we have a program for a gradual reduction of government spending base on these theory and i have a task force now that have be work on where those cut could be make i be confident that it can be do and that it will reduce inflation because i do it in california and inflation go down below the national average in california when we return money to the people and reduce government spending

 mr smith president carter

 the president governor reagan 's proposal the reagan kemp roth proposal be one of the most highly inflationary idea that ever have be present to the american public he would actually have to cut government spending by at least $ 130 billion in order to balance the budget under this ridiculous proposal

 i notice that his task force that be work for his future plan have some of their idea reveal in the wall street journal this week one of those idea be to repeal the minimum wage and several time this year governor reagan have say that the major cause of unemployment be the minimum wage this be a heartless kind of approach to the work family of our country which be typical of many republican leader in the past but i think have be accentuate under governor reagan

 in california i be surprised governor reagan bring this up he have the three large tax increase in the history of that state under his administration he more than double state spending while he be governor 122 percent increase and have between a 20- and 30 percent increase in the number of employee

 mr smith sorry to interrupt

 the president in california

 mr smith mr. carter

 the president thank you sir

 mr smith governor reagan have the last word on this question

 governor reagan yes the figure that the president have just use about california be a distortion of the situation there because while i be governor of california our spending in california increase less per capita than the spending in georgia while mr. carter be governor of georgia in the same 4 year the size of government increase only onesixth in california of what it increase in proportion to population in georgia

 and the idea that my tax cut proposal be inflationary i would like to ask the president why be it inflationary to let the people keep more of their money and spend it the way they would like and it be not inflationary to let he take that money and spend it the way he want

 mr smith i wish that question need not be rhetorical but it must be because we have run out of time on that now the third question to governor reagan from william hilliard

 urban policies

 mr hilliard yes governor reagan the decline of our city have be hasten by the continual rise in crime strained race relation the fall in the quality of public education the persistence of abnormal poverty in a rich nation and a decline in the service to the public the sign seem to point toward a deterioration that could lead to the establishment of a permanent underclass in the city what specifically would you do in the next 4 year to reverse this trend

 governor reagan i have be talk to a number of congressman who have much the same idea that i have and that be that in the inner city area that in cooperation with local government and with national government and use tax incentive and with cooperation with the private sector that we have development zone let the local entity the city declare this particular area base on the standard of the percentage of people on welfare unemployed and so forth in that area and then through tax incentive induce the creation of business provide job and so forth in those area

 the element of government through these tax incentive for example a business that would not have for a period of time an increase in the property tax reflect its development of the unused property that it be make would not be any loss to the city because the city be not get any tax from that now and there would simply be a delay and on the other hand many of the people that would then be give job be presently ward of the government and it would not hurt to give they a tax incentive because that would not be cost government anything either

 i think there be thing to do in this regard i stand in the south bronx on the exact spot that president carter stand on in 1977 you have to see it to believe it it look like a bomb out city great gaunt skeleton of building window smash out paint on one of they unkept promise on another despair and this be the spot at which president carter have promise that he be go to bring in a vast program to rebuild this area there be whole block of land that be leave bare just bulldoze down flat and nothing have be do and they be now charge to take tourist through there to see this terrible desolation

 i talk to a man just briefly there who ask i one simple question do i have reason to hope that i can someday take care of my family again nothing have be do

 mr smith follow up mr. hilliard

 mr hilliard yes governor reagan black and other nonwhite be increase in number in our city many of they feel that they be face a hostility from white that prevent they from join the economic mainstream of our society there be racial confrontation in the school on job and in housing as nonwhite seek to reap the benefit of a free society what do you think be the nation 's future as a multiracial society

 governor reagan i believe in it i be eternally optimistic and i happen to believe that we have make great progress from the day when i be young and when this country do not even know it have a racial problem i know those thing can grow out of despair in an inner city when there be hopelessness at home lack of work and so forth but i believe that all of we together and i believe the presidency be what teddy roosevelt say it be it be a bully pulpit and i think that something can be do from there because the goal for all of we should be that one day thing will be do neither because of nor in spite of any of the difference between we ethnic difference or racial difference whatever they may be that we will have total equal opportunity for all people and i would do everything i could in my power to bring that about

 mr smith mr. hilliard would you repeat your question for president carter

 mr hilliard president carter the decline of our city have be hasten by the continual rise in crime strained race relation the fall in the quality of public education the persistence of abnormal poverty in a rich nation and a decline in service to the public the sign seem to point toward a deterioration that could lead to the establishment of a permanent underclass in the city what specifically would you do in the next 4 year to reverse this trend

 the president thank you mr. hilliard

 when i be campaign in 1976 everywhere i go the mayor and local official be in despair about the rapidly deteriorate central city of our nation we initiate a very fine urban renewal program work with the mayor the governors and other interested official this have be a very successful effort that be one of the main reason that we have have such an increase in the number of people employ of the 9 million people put to work in new job since i have be in office 1.3 million of those have be among black americans and another million among those who speak spanish

 we now be plan to continue the revitalization program with increase commitment of rapid transit mass transit under the windfall profit tax we expect to spend about $ 43 billion in the next 10 year to rebuild the transportation system of our country we also be pursue housing program we have have a 73 percent increase in the allotment of federal fund for improved education these be the kind of effort work on a joint basis with community leader particularly in the minority area of the central city that have be deteriorate so rapidly in the past

 it be very important to we that this be do with the full involvement of minority citizen i have bring into the top level of government into the white house into administrative office of the executive branch into the judicial system highly qualified black and spanish citizen and woman who in the past have be exclude

 i notice that governor reagan say that when he be a young man that there be no knowledge of a racial problem in this country those who suffer from discrimination because of race or sex certainly know we have a racial problem we have go a long way toward correct these problem but we still have a long way to go

 mr smith a followup question

 mr hilliard yes president carter i would like to repeat the same followup to you black and other nonwhite be increase in number in our city many of they feel that they be face a hostility from white that prevent they from join the economic mainstream of our society there be racial confrontation in the school on job and in housing as nonwhite seek to reap the benefit of a free society what be your assessment of the nation 's future in a multiracial society

 the president ours be a nation of refugee a nation of immigrant almost all of our citizen come here from other land and now have hope which be be realize for a well life preserve their ethnic commitment their family structure their religious belief preserve their relationship with their relative in foreign country but still form themselves together in a very coherent society which give our nation its strength

 in the past those minority group have often be exclude from participation in the affair of government since i have be president i have appoint for instance more than twice as many black federal judge as all previous president in the history of this country i have do the same thing in the appointment of woman and also spanish speak americans to involve they in administration of government and a feeling that they belong to the societal structure that make decision in the judiciary and in executive branch be a very important commitment which i be try to realize and will continue to do so in the future

 mr smith governor reagan you have a minute for rebuttal

 governor reagan yes the president talk of government program and they have their place but as governor when i be at that end of the line and receive some of these grant for government program i see that so many of they be dead end they be public employment for these people who really want to get out into the private job market where there be job with a future

 now the president speak a moment ago about that i be against the minimum wage i wish he could have be with i when i sit with a group of teenager who be black and who be tell i about their unemployment problem and that it be the minimum wage that have do away with the job that they once could get and indeed every time it have increase you will find there be an increase in minority unemployment among young people and therefore i have be in favor of a separate minimum for they

 with regard to the great progress that have be make with this government spending the rate of black unemployment in detroit michigan be 56 percent

 mr smith president garter you have the last word on this question

 the president well it be obvious that we still have a long way to go in fully incorporate the minority group into the mainstream of american life we have make good progress and there be no doubt in my mind that the commitment to unemployment compensation the minimum wage welfare national health insurance those kind of commitment that have typify the democratic party since ancient history in this country 's political life be a very important element of the future in all those element governor reagan have repeatedly speak out against they which to i show a very great insensitivity to give deprived family a well chance in life this to i be a very important difference between he and i in this election and i believe the american people will judge accordingly

 there be no doubt in my mind that in the downtown central city with the new commitment on an energy policy with a chance to revitalize home and to make they more fuel efficient with a chance for a synthetic fuel program solar power this will give we an additional opportunity for job which will pay rich dividend

 mr smith thank you gentleman

 now for the fourth question to president garter from barbara walters

 international terrorism

 ms walters mr. president the eye of the country tonight be on the hostage in iran i realize this be a sensitive area but the question of how we respond to act of terrorism go beyond this current crisis other country have policy that determine how they will respond israel for example consider hostage like soldier and will not negotiate with terrorist

 for the future mr. president the country have the right to know do you have a policy for deal with terrorism wherever it might happen and what have we learn from this experience in iran that might cause we to do thing differently if this or something similar happen again

 the president barbara one of the blight on this world be the threat and the activity of terrorist at one of the recent economic summit conference between myself and the other leader of the we stern world we commit ourselves to take strong action against terrorism airplane hijacking be one of the element of that commitment there be no doubt that we have see in recent year in recent month additional act of violence against jews in france and of course against those who live in israel by the plo and other terrorist organization

 ultimately the most serious terrorist threat be if one of those radical nation who believe in terrorism as a policy should have atomic weapon both i and all my predecessor have have a deep commitment to control the proliferation of nuclear weapon in country like libya or iraq we have even alienate some of our close trade partner because we have insist upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapon to those potentially terrorist country

 when governor reagan have be ask about that he make a very disturbing comment that nonproliferation or the control of the spread of nuclear weapon be none of our business and when he be ask specifically recently about iraq he say there be nothing we can do about it

 this ultimate terrorist threat be the most fearsome of all and it be part of a pattern where our country must stand firm to control terrorism of all kind

 mr smith ms. walters a followup

 ms walters yes while we be discuss policy have iran not take american hostage i assume that in order to preserve our neutrality we would have stop the flow of spare part and vital war materiel once war break out between iraq and iran now we be offer to lift the ban on such good if they let our people come home do not this reward terrorism compromise our neutrality and possibly antagonize nation now friendly to we in the middle east

 the president we will maintain our position of neutrality in the iran and iraq war we have no plan to sell additional materiel or good to iran that might be of a warlike nature when i make my decision to stop all trade with iran as a result of the taking of our hostage i announce then and have consistently maintain since then that if the hostage be release safely that we would make delivery on those item which iran own which they have buy and pay for also that the frozen iranian asset would be release that be be a consistent policy one i intend to carry out

 mr smith would you repeat the question now for governor reagan please ms. walters

 ms. walters yes governor the eye of the country tonight remain on the hostage in iran but the question of how we respond to act of terrorism go beyond this current crisis there be other country that have policy that determine how they will respond israel for example consider hostage like soldier and will not negotiate with terrorist

 for the future the country have the right to know do you have a policy for deal with terrorism wherever it might happen and what have we learn from this experience in iran that might cause we to do thing differently if this or something similar should happen again

 governor reagan well barbara you have ask that question twice i think you ought to have at least one answer to it

 i have be accuse lately of have a secret plan with regard to the hostage now this come from an answer that i have make at least 50 time during this campaign to the press the question would be have you any idea of what you would do if you be there and i say well yes and i think that anyone that be seek this position as well as other people probably have think to themselves what about this what about that these be just idea of what i would think of if i be in that position and have access to the information in which i would know all the option that be open to i i have never answer the question however second the one that say well tell i what be some of those idea first of all i would be fearful that i might say something that be presently under way or in negotiation and thus expose it and endanger the hostage and sometimes i think some of my idea might involve quiet diplomacy where you do not say in advance or say to anyone what it be you be think of do

 your question be difficult to answer because in the situation right now no one want to say anything that would inadvertently delay in any way the return of those hostage if there be a chance of their come home soon or that might cause they harm

 what i do think should be do once they be safely here with their family and that tragedy be over and we have endure this humiliation for just lack 1 week of a year now then i think it be time for we to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic effort that be make in the beginning why they have be there so long and when they come home what do we have to do in order to bring that about what arrangement be make and i would suggest that congress should hold such an investigation

 in the meantime i be go to continue pray that they will come home

 mr smith follow up question

 ms. walters well i would like to say that neither candidate answer specifically the question of a specific policy for deal with terrorism but i will ask governor reagan a different followup question you have suggest that there would be no iranian crisis have you be president because we would have give firm support to the shah but iran be a country of 37 million people who be resist a government they regard as dictatorial

 my question be not whether the shah 's regime be preferable to the ayatollah 's but whether the united states have the power or the right to try to determine what form of government any country will have and do we back unpopular regime whose major merit be that they be friendly to the united states

 governor reagan the degree of unpopularity of a regime when the choice be total authoritarianism totalitarianism i should say in the alternative government make one wonder whether you be be helpful to the people and we have be guilty of that because someone do not meet exactly our standard of human right even though they be an ally of ours instead of try patiently to persuade they to change their way we have in a number of instance aid a revolutionary overthrow which result in complete totalitarianism instead for those people and i think that this be a kind of a hypocritical policy when at the same time we be maintain a detente with the one nation in the world where there be no human right at all the soviet union

 now there be a second phase in the iranian affair in which we have something to do with that and that be we have adequate warning that there be a threat to our embassy and we could have do what other embassy do either strengthen our security there or remove our personnel before the kidnap and the takeover take place

 mr smith governor i be sorry i must interrupt president carter you have a minute for rebuttal

 the president i do not hear any comment from governor reagan about what he would do to stop or to reduce terrorism in the future what the western ally do decide to do be to stop all air flight commercial air flight to any nation involve in terrorism or the hijacking of airplane or the harboring of hijacker secondly we all commit ourselves as have all my predecessor in the oval office not to permit the spread of nuclear weapon to a terrorist nation or to any other nation that do not presently have those weapon or capability for explosive third not to make any sale of materiel or weapon to a nation which be involve in terrorist activity and lastly not to deal with the plo until and unless the plo recognize israel 's right to exist and recognize u.n. resolution 242 as a basis for a middle east peace

 these be a few of the thing to which our nation be commit and we will continue with these commitment

 mr smith governor reagan you have the last word on that question

 governor reagan yes i have no quarrel whatsoever with the thing that have be do because i believe it be high time that the civilized country of the world make it plain that there be no room worldwide for terrorism there will be no negotiation with terrorist of any kind and while i have a last word here i would like to correct a misstatement of fact by the president i have never make the statement that he suggest about nuclear proliferation and nuclear proliferation or the try to halt it would be a major part of a foreign policy of mine

 mr. smith thank you gentleman that be the first half of the debate

 now the rule for the second half quite simple they be only complicated when i explain they in the second half the panelist with i will have no followup question instead after the panelist have ask a question the candidate have answer each of the candidate will have two opportunity to follow up to question to rebut or just to comment on his opponent 's statement

 governor reagan will respond in this section to the first question from marvin stone

 strategic arms limitation

 mr. stone governor reagan arm control the president say it be the single most important issue both of you have express the desire to end the nuclear arm race with russia but by method that be vastly different you suggest that we scrap the salt ii treaty already negotiate and intensify the buildup of american power to induce the soviets to sign a new treaty one more favorable to we

 governor reagan yes

 mr stone president carter on the other hand say he will again try to convince a reluctant congress to ratify the present treaty on the ground it be the good we can hope to get

 now both of you can not be right will you tell we why you think you be

 governor reagan yes i think i be right because i believe that we must have a consistent foreign policy a strong america and a strong economy and then as we build up our national security to restore our margin of safety we at the same time try to restrain the soviet buildup which have be go forward at a rapid pace and for quite some time

 the salt ii treaty be the result of negotiation that mr. carter 's team enter into after he have ask the soviet union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapon and his emissary i think come home in 12 hour having hear a very definite yet but take that one no from the soviet union we then go back into negotiation on their term because mr. carter have cancel the b-1 bomber delay the mx delay the trident submarine delay the cruise missile shut down the minuteman missile production line and whatever other thing that might have be do the soviet union sit at the table know that we have go forward with unilateral concession without any reciprocation from they whatsoever

 now i have not block the salt ii treaty as mr. carter and mr. mondale suggest that i have it have be block by a senate in which there be a democratic majority indeed the senate armed services committee vote 10 to 0 with 7 abstention against the salt ii treaty and declare that it be not in the national security interest of the united states besides which it be illegal because the law of the land pass by congress say we can not accept a treaty in which we be not equal and we be not equal in this treaty for one reason alone our b-52 bomber be consider to be strategic weapon their backfire bomber be not

 mr smith governor i have to interrupt you at that point the time be up for that but the same question now to president carter

 mr stone yes president carter both of you have express the desire to end the nuclear arm race with russia but through vastly different method the governor suggest we scrap the salt ii treaty which you sign in vienna intensify the buildup of american power to induce the soviets to sign a new treaty one more favorable to we you on the other hand say you will again try to convince a reluctant congress to ratify the present treaty on the ground it be the good we can hope to get from the russians

 you can not both be right will you tell we why you think you be

 the president yes i would be glad to inflation unemployment the city all very important issue but they pale into insignificance in the life and duty of a president when compare with the control of nuclear weapon every president who have serve in the oval office since harry truman have be dedicate to the proposition of control nuclear weapon to negotiate with the soviet union balanced control observable and then reduce level of atomic weaponry

 there be a disturbing pattern in the attitude of governor reagan he have never support any of those arm control agreement the limited test ban salt i nor the antiballistic missile treaty nor the vladivostok treaty negotiate with the soviet union by president ford and now he want to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapon on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the soviet union negotiate over a 7 year period by myself and my two republican predecessor

 the senate have not vote yet on the strategic arm limitation treaty there have be preliminary skirmishing in the committee of the senate but the treaty have never come to the floor of the senate for either a debate or a vote it be understandable that a senator in the preliminary debate can make an irresponsible statement or maybe an ill advise statement you have get 99 other senator to correct that mistake if it be a mistake but when a man who hope to be president say take this treaty discard it do not vote do not debate do not explore the issue do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation that be a very dangerous and disturbing thing

 mr smith governor reagan you have an opportunity to rebut that

 governor reagan yes i would like to respond very much

 first of all the soviet union if i have be critical of some of the previous agreement it be because we have be outnegotiate for quite a long time and they have manage in spite of all of our attempt at arm limitation to go forward with the big military buildup in the history of man

 now to suggest that because two republican presidents try to pass the salt treaty that put they on its side i would like to say that president ford who be within 90 percent of a treaty that we could be in agreement with when he leave office be emphatically against this salt treaty i would like to point out also that senator like henry jackson and hollings of south carolina they be take the lead in the fight against this particular treaty

 i be not talk of scrapping i be talk of take the treaty back and go back into negotiation and i would say to the soviet union we will sit and negotiate with you as long as it take to have not only legitimate arm limitation but to have a reduction of these nuclear weapon to the point that neither one of we represent a threat to the other that be hardly throw away a treaty and be oppose to arm limitation

 mr smith president carter

 the president yes governor reagan be make some very misleading and disturbing statement he not only advocate the scrapping of this treaty and i do not know that these man that he quote be against the treaty in its final form but he also advocate the possibility he say it be be a missing element of play a trump card against the soviet union of a nuclear arm race and insist upon nuclear superiority by our own nation as a predication for negotiation in the future with the soviet union

 if president brezhnev say we will scrap this treaty negotiate under three american president over a 7 year period of time we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiation and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arm race be a good basis for future negotiation it be obvious that i as president and all americans would reject such a proposition this would mean the resumption of a very dangerous nuclear arm race

 it would be very disturbing to american people it would change the basic tone and commitment that our nation have experience ever since the second world war with all president democratic and republican and would also be very disturbing to our ally all of whom support this nuclear arm treaty in addition to that the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the soviet union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly

 this attitude be extremely dangerous and belligerent in its tone although it be say with a quiet voice

 mr smith governor reagan

 governor reagan i know the president 's suppose to be reply to i but sometimes i have a hard time in connect what he be say with what i have say or what my position be i sometimes think he be like the witch doctor that get mad when a good doctor come along with a cure that will work

 my point i have make already mr. president with regard to negotiating it do not call for nuclear superiority on the part of the united states it call for a mutual reduction of these weapon as i say that neither of we can represent a threat to the other and to suggest that the salt ii treaty that your negotiator negotiate be just a continuation and base on all of the precede effort by two previous president be just not true it be a new negotiation because as i say president ford be within about 10 percent of have a solution that could be acceptable and i think our ally would be very happy to go along with a fair and verifiable salt agreement

 mr smith president carter you have the last word on this question

 the president i think to close out this discussion it would be well to put into perspective what we be talk about

 i have a discussion with my daughter amy the other day before i come here to ask she what the most important issue be she say she think nuclear weaponry and the control of nuclear arm

 this be a formidable force some of these weapon have 10 megaton of explosion if you put 50 ton of tnt in each one of railroad car you would have a trainload of tnt stretch across this nation that be one major war explosion in a warhead we have thousand equivalent of megaton or million ton of tnt warhead the control of these weapon be the single major responsibility of a president and to cast out this commitment of all president because of some slight technicality that can be correct be a very dangerous approach

 mr smith we have to go to another question now from harry ellis to president carter

 energy

 mr ellis mr. president as you have say americans through conservation be import much less oil today than we be even a year ago yet u.s. dependence on arab oil as a percentage of total import be today much high than it be at the time of the 1973 arab oil embargo and for some time to come the loss of substantial amount of arab oil could plunge the u.s. into depression now this mean that a bridge must be build out of this dependence

 can the united states develop synthetic fuel and other alternative energy source without damage to the environment and will this process mean steadily high fuel bill for american family

 the president i do not think there be any doubt that in the future the cost of oil be go to go up what i have have as a basic commitment since i have be president be to reduce our dependence on foreign oil it can only be do in two way one to conserve energy to stop the waste of energy and secondly to produce more american energy

 we have be very successful in both case we have now reduce the importing of foreign oil in the last year alone by onethird we import today 2 million barrel of oil less than we do the same day just a year ago

 this commitment have be open up a very bright vista for our nation in the future because with the windfall profit tax as a base we now have an opportunity to use american technology and american ability and american natural resource to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuel yes to expand rapidly the production of solar energy yes and also to produce the conventional kind of american energy we will drill more oil and gas well this year than any year in history we will produce more coal this year than any year in history we be export more coal this year than any year in history and we have an opportunity now with improved transportation system and improved loading facility in our port to see a very good opportunity on the world international market to replace opec oil with american coal as a basic energy source

 this exciting future will not only give we more energy security but will also open up vast opportunity for americans to live a well life and to have million of new job associate with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we have put into effect

 mr smith would you repeat the question now for governor reagan

 mr ellis governor reagan americans through conservation be import much less oil today than we be even a year ago and yet u.s. reliance on arab oil as a percentage of total import be much high today than it be during the 1973 arab oil embargo and the substantial loss of arab oil could plunge the united states into depression

 the question be whether the development of alternative energy source in order to reduce this dependence can be do without damage the environment and will it mean for american family steadily high fuel bill

 governor reagan i be not sure that it mean steadily high fuel cost but i do believe that this nation have be portray for too long a time to the people as be energy poor when it be energy rich the coal that the president mention yes we have it and yet one eighth of our total coal resource be not be utilize at all right now the mine be close down there be 22,000 miner out of work most of this be due to regulation which either interfere with the mining of it or prevent the burning of it with our modern technology yes we can burn our coal within the limit of the clean air act i think as technology improve we will be able to do even well with that

 the other thing be that we have only lease out and begin to explore 2 percent of our outer continental shelf for oil where it be believe by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy that there be vast supply yet to be find our government have in the last year or so take out of multiple use million of acre of public land that once be well they be public land subject to multiple use exploration for mineral and so forth it be believe that probably 70 percent of the potential oil in the united states be probably hide in those land and no one be allow to even go and explore to find out if it be there this be particularly true of the recent effort to shut down part of alaska

 nuclear power there be 36 powerplant plan in this country and let i add the word safety it must be do with the utmost of safety but 32 of those have give up and cancel their plan to build and again because government regulation and permit and so forth make it take more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the united states as it do to build one in japan or in western europe

 we have the source here we be energy rich and coal be one of the great potential we have

 mr smith president carter your comment

 the president yes sir to repeat myself we have this year the opportunity which we will realize to produce 800 million ton of coal an unequaled record in the history of our country governor reagan say that this be not a good achievement and he blame restraint on coal production on regulation regulation that affect the life and the health and safety of miner and also regulation that protect the purity of our air and the quality of our water and our land we can not cast aside those regulation we have a chance in the next 15 year insist upon the health and safety of worker in the mine and also preserve the same high air and water pollution standard to triple the amount of coal we produce

 governor reagan 's approach to our energy policy which have already prove its effectiveness be to repeal or to change substantially the windfall profit tax to return a major portion of $ 227 billion back to the oil company to do away with the department of energy to shortcircuit our synthetic fuel program to put a minimal emphasis on solar power to emphasize strongly nuclear powerplant as a major source of energy in the future he want to put all our egg in one basket and give that basket to the major oil company

 mr smith governor reagan

 governor reagan that be a misstatement of course of my position i just happen to believe that free enterprise can do a well job of produce the thing that people need than government can the department of energy have a multibillion dollar budget in excess of $ 10 billion it have not produce a quart of oil or a lump of coal or anything else in the line of energy

 and for mr. carter to suggest that i want to do away with the safety law and with the law that pertain to clean water and clean air and so forth as governor of california i take charge of pass the strict air pollution law in the united states the strict air quality law that have ever be adopt in the united states and we create an osha an occupational safety and health agency for the protection of employee before the federal government have one in place and to this day not one of its decision or ruling have ever be challenge

 so i think some of those charge be miss the point i be suggest that there be literally thousand of unnecessary regulation that invade every facet of business and indeed very much of our personal life that be unnecessary that government can do without that have add $ 130 billion to the cost of production in this country and that be contribute their part to inflation and i would like to see we a little more free as we once be

 mr smith president carter another crack at that

 the president sure as a matter of fact the air pollution standard law that be pass in california be pass over the objection of governor reagan and this be a very well know fact also recently when someone suggest that the occupational safety and health act should be abolish governor reagan respond amen

 the offshore drilling right be a question that governor reagan raise often as a matter of fact in the proposal for the alaska land legislation 100 percent of all the offshore land would be open for exploration and 95 percent of all the alaska land where it be suspect or believe that mineral might exist we have with our 5 year plan for the leasing of offshore land propose more land to be drill than have be open up for drilling since this program first start in 1954

 so we be not put restraint on american exploration we be encourage it in every way we can

 mr smith governor reagan you have the last word on this question

 governor reagan yes if it be a wellknown fact that i oppose air pollution law in california the only thing i can possibly think of be that the president must be suggest the law that the federal government try to impose on the state of california not a law regulation that would have make it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limit of any california city or have a place to put it if you do drive it against their regulation it would have destroy the economy of california and i must say we have the support of congress when point out how ridiculous this attempt be by the environmental protection agency we still have the strict air control or air pollution law in the country

 as for offshore oiling only 2 percent now be so leased and be produce oil the rest as to whether the land be go to be open in the next 5 year or so we be already 5 year behind in what we should be do there be more oil now in the well that have be drill than have be take out in the 121 year that they have be drill

 mr smith thank you governor

 thank you mr. president

 the next question go to governor reagan from william hilliard

 social security

 mr hilliard governor reagan wage earner in this country especially the young be support a social security system that continue to affect their income drastically the system be foster a struggle between the young and the old and be drift the country toward a polarization of these two group how much long can the young wage earner expect to bear the ever increase burden of the social security system

 governor reagan the social security system be base on a false premise with regard to how fast the number of worker would increase and how fast the number of retiree would increase it be actuarially out of balance and this first become evident about 16 year ago and some of we be voice warning then now it be trillion of dollar out of balance and the only answer that have come so far be the big single tax increase in our nation 's history the payroll tax increase for social security which will only put a band aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few year at most

 what be need be a study that i have propose by a task force of expert to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reform and make actuarially sound but with the premise that no one presently dependent on social security be go to have the rug pull out from under they and not get their check we can not frighten as we have with the threat and the campaign rhetoric that have go on in this campaign our senior citizen leave they think that in some way they be endanger and they would have no place to turn they must continue to get those check and i believe that the system can be put on a sound actuarial basis but it be go to take some study and some work and not just pass a tax increase to let the roof fall in on the next administration

 mr smith would you repeat that question for president carter

 mr hilliard yes president carter wage earner in this country especially the young be support a social security system that continue to affect their income drastically the system be foster a struggle between young and old and be drift the country toward a polarization of these two group how much long can the young wage earner expect to bear the ever increase burden of the social security system

 the president as long as there be a democratic president in the white house we will have a strong and viable social security system free of the threat of bankruptcy although governor reagan have change his position lately on four different occasion he have advocate make social security a voluntary system which would in effect very quickly bankrupt it i notice also in the wall street journal early this week that a preliminary report of his task force advocate make social security more sound by reduce the adjustment in social security for the retired people to compensate for the impact of inflation these kind of approach be very dangerous to the security and the well being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approach retirement age

 but no matter what it take in the future to keep social security sound it must be keep that way and although there be a serious threat to the social security system and its integrity during the 1976 campaign and when i become president the action of the democratic congress work with i have be to put social security back on a sound financial basis that be the way it will stay

 mr smith governor reagan

 governor reagan well that just be not true it have as i say delay the actuarial imbalance fall on we for just a few year with that increase in taxis and i do not believe we can go on increase the tax because the problem for the young people today be that they be pay in far more than they can ever expect to get out

 now again this statement that somehow i want to destroy it and i just change my tune that i be for voluntary social security which would mean the ruin of it mr. president the voluntary thing that i suggest many year ago be that a young man orphan and raise by an aunt who die his aunt be ineligible for social security insurance because she be not his mother and i suggest that if this be an insurance program certainly the person who be pay in should be able to name his own beneficiary and that be the close i have ever come to anything voluntary with social security i too be pledge to a social security program that will reassure these senior citizen of ours they be go to continue to get their money

 they be some change i would like to make i would like to make a change that discriminate in the regulation against a wife who work and find that she then be face with a choice between her husband 's benefit if he die first or what she have pay in but it do not recognize that she have also be pay in herself and she be entitle to more than she presently can get i would like to change that

 mr smith president carter 's rebuttal now

 the president fine these constant suggestion that the basic social security system should be change do cause concern and consternation among the aged of our country it be obvious that we should have a commitment to they that social security benefit should not be tax and that there would be no peremptory change in the standard by which social security payment be make to the retired people we also need to continue to index the social security payment so that if inflation rise the social security payment would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of the social security check continue intact

 in the past the relationship between social security and medicare have be very important to provide some modicum of aid for senior citizen in the retention of health benefit governor reagan as a matter of fact begin his political career campaign around this nation against medicare now we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance with an emphasis on the prevention of disease an emphasis on outpatient care not inpatient care an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care for those who be ill an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance so that if a family be threaten with be wipe out economically because of a very high medical bill then the insurance would help pay for it these be the kind of element of a national health insurance important to the american people governor reagan again typically be against such a proposal

 mr smith governor

 governor reagan there you go again laughter

 when i oppose medicare there be another piece of legislation meet the same problem before the congress i happen to favor the other piece of legislation and think that it would be well for the senior citizen and provide well care than the one that be finally pass i be not oppose the principle of provide care for they i be oppose one piece of legislation as versus another

 there be something else about social security of course that do not come out of the payroll tax it come out of the general fund that something should be do about i think it be disgraceful that the disability insurance fund in social security find check go every month to ten of thousand of people who be lock up in our institution for crime or for mental illness and they be receive disability check from social security every month while a state institution provide for all of their need and their care

 mr smith president carter you have the last word on this question

 the president i think this debate on social security medicare national health insurance typifie as vividly as any other subject tonight the basic historical difference between the democratic party and the republican party the allusion to basic change in the minimum wage be another and the deleterious comment that governor reagan have make about unemployment compensation these commitment that the democratic party have historically make to the work family of this nation have be extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a well quality of life for they

 i notice recently that governor reagan frequently quote democratic president in his acceptance address and otherwise i have never hear a candidate for president who be a republican quote a republican president but when they get in office they try to govern like republicans so its good for the american people to remember there be a sharp basic historical difference between governor reagan and i on these crucial issue also between the two party that we represent

 mr smith thank you mr. president governor reagan

 we now go to another question a question to president carter by barbara walters

 assessment of opponent

 ms walters thank you

 you have address some of the major issue tonight but the big issue in the mind of american voter be yourself your ability to lead this country when many voter go into that booth just a week from today they will be vote their gut instinct about you man

 you have already give we your reason why people should vote for you now would you please tell we for this your final question why they should not vote for your opponent why his presidency could be harmful to the nation and having examine both your opponent 's record and the man himself tell we his great weakness

 the president barbara reluctant as i be to say anything critical about governor reagan i will try to answer your question laughter

 first of all there be the historical perspective that i just describe this be a contest between a democrat in the mainstream of my party as exemplify by the action that i have take in the oval office the last 4 year as contrast with governor reagan who in most case do typify his party but in some case there be a radical departure by he from the heritage of eisenhower and other the most important crucial difference in this election campaign in my judgment be the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapon to other nation that do not presently have it particularly the terrorist nation

 the inclination that governor reagan have exemplify in many troubled time since he be be run for president i think since 1968 to inject american military force in place like north korea to put a blockade around cuba this year or in some instance to project american force into a fishing dispute against the small nation of ecuador on the west coast of south america this be typical of his longstanding inclination on the use of american power not to resolve dispute diplomatically and peacefully but to show that the exercise of military power be well prove by the actual use of it

 obviously no president want war and i certainly do not believe that governor reagan if he be president would want war but a president in the oval office have to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace through diplomacy or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which have exemplify his attitude in the past

 mr smith barbara would you repeat the question for governor reagan

 ms walters yes thank you realize that you may be equally reluctant to speak ill of your opponent may i ask why people should not vote for your opponent why his presidency could be harmful to the nation and having examine both your opponent 's record and the man himself could you tell we his great weakness

 governor reagan well barbara i believe that there be a fundamental difference and i think it have be evident in most of the answer that mr. carter have give tonight that he seek the solution to anything as another opportunity for a federal government program i happen to believe that the federal government have usurped power and autonomy and authority that belong back at the state and local level it have impose on the individual freedom of the people and that there be more of these thing that could be solve by the people themselves if they be give a chance or by the level of government that be close to they

 now as to why i should be and he should not be when he be a candidate in 1976 president carter invent a thing he call the misery index he add the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation and it come at that time to 12.5 under president ford and he say that no man with that size misery index have a right to seek reelection to the presidency today by his own decision the misery index be in excess of 20 percent and i think this must suggest something

 but when i have quote a democrat president as the president say i be a democrat i say many foolish thing back in those day laughter but the president that i quote have make a promise a democrat promise and i quote he because it be never keep and today you would find that that promise be at the very heart of what republicanism represent in this country today and that be why i believe there be go to be million of democrats that be go to vote with we this time around because they too want that promise keep it be a promise for less government and less taxis and more freedom for the people

 mr smith president carter

 the president yes i mention the radical departure of governor reagan from the principle or ideal or historical perspective of his own party i do not think this can be well illustrate than in the case with guarantee woman equal right under the constitution of our nation for 40 year the republican party platform call for guarantee woman equal right with a constitutional amendment six predecessor of mine who serve in the oval office call for this guarantee of woman 's right governor reagan and the new republican party have depart from this commitment a very severe blow to the opportunity for woman finally to correct discrimination under which they have suffer

 when a man and a woman do the same amount of work a man get pay a dollar a woman only get pay 59 cent and the equal right amendment only say that equality of right shall not be abridge for woman by the federal government or by the state government that be all it say a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typify the democratic party and which be a very important commitment of mine as contrast with governor reagan 's radical departure from the longstanding policy of his own party

 mr smith governor reagan

 governor reagan yes mr. president once again i happen to be against the amendment because i think the amendment will take this problem out of the hand of elect legislator and put it in the hand of unelected judge i be for equal right and while you have be in office for 4 year and not one single state and most of they have a majority of democratic legislator have add to the ratification or vote to ratify the equal right amendment

 while i be governor more than 8 year ago i find 14 separate instance where woman be discriminate against in the body of california law and i have pass and sign into law 14 statute that eliminate those discrimination include the economic one that you have just mention equal pay and so forth i believe that if in all these year that we have spend try to get the amendment that we have spend as much time correct these law as we do in california and we be the first to do it

 if i be president i would also now take a look at the hundred of federal regulation which discriminate against woman and which go right on while everyone be look for an amendment i would have someone ride herd on those regulation and we would start eliminate those discrimination in the federal government against woman

 mr smith president carter

 the president yes howard i be a southerner and i share the basic belief of my region about an excessive government intrusion into the private affair of american citizen and also into the private affair of the free enterprise system one of the commitment that i make be to deregulate the major industry of this country we have be remarkably successful with the help of the democratic congress we have deregulate the air industry the rail industry the trucking industry financial institution now work on the communication industry

 in addition to that i believe this element of discrimination be something that the south have see so vividly as a blight on our region of the country which have now be correct not only racial discrimination but discrimination against people that have to work for a living because we have be try to pick ourselves up by our bootstrap since the long depression year and lead a full and useful life in the affair of this country we have make remarkable success it be part of my consciousness and of my commitment to continue this progress

 so my heritage as a southerner my experience in the oval office convince i that what i have just describe be a proper course for the future

 mr smith governor reagan yours be the last word

 governor reagan well my last word be again to say that we be talk about this very simple amendment and woman 's right and i make it plain again i be for woman 's right but i would like to call the attention of the people to the fact that so call simple amendment could be use by mischievous man to destroy discrimination that properly belong by law to woman respect the physical difference between the two sex labor law that protect they against do thing that would be physically harmful to they those could all be challenge by man and the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth

 i think that be the subject we be suppose to be on but if we be talk about how much we think about the work people and so forth i be the only fellow that ever run for this job who be six time president of his own union and still have a lifetime membership in that union

 mr smith gentleman each of you now have 3 minute for a closing statement president carter you be first

 closing statement

 the president first of all i would like to thank the league of women voters for make this debate possible i think it be be a very constructive debate and i hope it be help to acquaint the american people with the sharp difference between myself and governor reagan also i want to thank the people of cleveland and ohio for be such hospitable host during this last few hour in my life

 i have be president now for almost 4 year i have have to make thousand of decision and each one of those decision have be a learning process i have see the strength of my nation and i have see the crisis that it approach in a tentative way and i have have to deal with those crisis as good i could

 as i have study the record between myself and governor reagan i have be impress with the stark difference that exist between we i think the result of this debate indicate that that fact be true i consider myself in the mainstream of my party i consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of president who have serve before i the united states must be a nation strong the united states must be a nation secure we must have a society that be just and fair and we must extend the benefit of our own commitment to peace to create a peaceful world

 i believe that since i have be in office there have be six or eight area of combat evolve in other part of the world in each case i alone have have to determine the interest of my country and the degree of involvement of my country i have do that with moderation with care with thoughtfulness sometimes consult expert but i have learn in this last 3 1/2 year that when an issue be extremely difficult when the call be very close the chance be the expert will be divide almost 50 50 and the final judgment about the future of our nation war peace involvement reticence thoughtfulness care consideration concern have to be make by the man in the oval office it be a lonely job but with the involvement of the american people in the process with an open government the job be a very gratifying one

 the american people now be face next tuesday a lonely decision those listen to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country and i think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference if one vote per precinct have change in 1960 john kennedy would never have be president of this nation and if a few more people have go to the poll and vote in 1968 hubert humphrey would have be president richard nixon would not

 there be a partnership involve and our nation to stay strong to stay at peace to raise high the banner of human right to set an example for the rest of the world to let our deep belief and commitment be feel by other in all other nation be my plan for the future i ask the american people to join i in this partnership

 mr smith governor reagan

 governor reagan yes i would like to add my word of thank too to the lady of the league of women voters for make these debate possible i be sorry that we could not persuade the bringing in of the third candidate so that he could have be see also in these debate but still it be good that at least once all three of we be hear by the people of this country

 next tuesday be election day next tuesday all of you will go to the poll you will stand there in the polling place and make a decision i think when you make that decision it might be well if you would ask yourself be you well off than you be 4 year ago be it easy for you to go and buy thing in the store than it be 4 year ago be there more or less unemployment in the country than there be 4 year ago be america as respect throughout the world as it be do you feel that our security be as safe that we be as strong as we be 4 year ago and if you answer all of those question yes why then i think your choice be very obvious as to who you will vote for if you do not agree if you do not think that this course that we have be on for the last 4 year be what you would like to see we follow for the next 4 then i could suggest another choice that you have

 this country do not have to be in the shape that it be in we do not have to go on sharing in scarcity with the country get bad off with unemployment grow we talk about the unemployment line if all of the unemployed today be in a single line allow 2 foot for each one of they that line would reach from new york city to los angeles california all of this can be cure and all of it can be solve

 i have not have the experience the president have have in hold that office but i think in be governor of california the most populous state in the union if it be a nation it would be the seventh rank economic power in the world i too have some lonely moment and decision to make i know that the economic program that i have propose for this nation in the next few year can resolve many of the problem that trouble we today i know because we do it there we cut the cost the increase cost of government the increase in half over the 8 year we return $ 5.7 billion in tax rebate credit and cut to our people we as i have say early fall below the national average in inflation when we do that and i know that we do give back authority and autonomy to the people

 i would like to have a crusade today and i would like to lead that crusade with your help and it would be one to take government off the back of the great people of this country and turn you loose again to do those thing that i know you can do so well because you do they and make this country great

 thank you

 mr smith gentleman lady and gentleman for 60 year the league of women voters have be commit to citizen education and effective participation of americans in governmental and political affair the most critical element of all in that process be an informed citizen who go to the poll and who vote

 on behalf of the league of women voters now i would like to thank president carter and governor reagan for be with we in cleveland tonight and lady and gentleman thank you and good night

good evening in a few day i will lay down my official responsibility in this office to take up once more the only title in our democracy superior to that of president the title of citizen

 of vice president mondale my cabinet and the hundred of other who have serve with i during the last 4 year i wish to say now publicly what i have say in private i thank they for the dedication and competence they have bring to the service of our country but i owe my deep thank to you to the american people because you give i this extraordinary opportunity to serve

 we have face great challenge together and we know that future problem will also be difficult but i be now more convinced than ever that the united states well than any other country can meet successfully whatever the future might bring these last 4 year have make i more certain than ever of the inner strength of our country the unchanging value of our principle and ideal the stability of our political system the ingenuity and the decency of our people

 tonight i would like first to say a few word about this most special office the presidency of the united states this be at once the most powerful office in the world and among the most severely constrain by law and custom the president be give a broad responsibility to lead but can not do so without the support and consent of the people express formally through the congress and informally in many way through a whole range of public and private institution this be as it should be

 within our system of government every american have a right and a duty to help shape the future course of the united states thoughtful criticism and close scrutiny of all government official by the press and the public be an important part of our democratic society now as in the past only the understanding and involvement of the people through full and open debate can help to avoid serious mistake and assure the continue dignity and safety of the nation

 today we be ask our political system to do thing of which the founding fathers never dream the government they design for a few hundred thousand people now serve a nation of almost 230 million people their small coastal republic now span beyond a continent and we also now have the responsibility to help lead much of the world through difficult time to a secure and prosperous future

 today as people have become ever more doubtful of the ability of the government to deal with our problem we be increasingly draw to single issue group and special interest organization to ensure that whatever else happen our own personal view and our own private interest be protect this be a disturbing factor in american political life it tend to distort our purpose because the national interest be not always the sum of all our single or special interest we be all americans together and we must not forget that the common good be our common interest and our individual responsibility

 because of the fragmented pressure of these special interest it be very important that the office of the president be a strong one and that its constitutional authority be preserve the president be the only elect official charge with the primary responsibility of represent all the people in the moment of decision after the different and conflicting view have all be air it be the president who then must speak to the nation and for the nation

 i understand after 4 year in this office as few other can how formidable be the task the new president elect be about to undertake and to the very limit of conscience and conviction i pledge to support he in that task i wish he success and godspeed

 i know from experience that president have to face major issue that be controversial broad in scope and which do not arouse the natural support of a political majority for a few minute now i want to lay aside my role as leader of one nation and speak to you as a fellow citizen of the world about three issue three difficult issue the threat of nuclear destruction our stewardship of the physical resource of our planet and the preeminence of the basic right of human being

 it be now be 35 year since the first atomic bomb fall on hiroshima the great majority of the world 's people can not remember a time when the .nuclear shadow do not hang over the earth our mind have adjust to it as after a time our eye adjust to the dark yet the risk of a nuclear conflagration have not lessen it have not happen yet thank god but that can give we little comfort for it only have to happen once

 the danger be become great as the arsenal of the superpower grow in size and sophistication and as other government perhaps even in the future dozen of government acquire these weapon it may only be a matter of time before madness desperation greed or miscalculation let loose this terrible force

 in an all out nuclear war more destructive power than in all of world war ii would be unleash every second during the long afternoon it would take for all the missile and bomb to fall a world war ii every second more people kill in the first few hour than in all the war of history put together the survivor if any would live in despair amid the poison ruin of a civilization that have commit suicide

 national weakness real or perceive can tempt aggression and thus cause war that be why the united states can never neglect its military strength we must and we will remain strong but with equal determination the united states and all country must find way to control and to reduce the horrifying danger that be pose by the enormous world stockpile of nuclear arm

 this have be a concern of every american president since the moment we first see what these weapon could do our leader will require our understanding and our support as they grapple with this difficult but crucial challenge there be no disagreement on the goal or the basic approach to control this enormous destructive force the answer lie not just in the attitude or the action of world leader but in the concern and the demand of all of we as we continue our struggle to preserve the peace

 nuclear weapon be an expression of one side of our human character but there be another side the same rocket technology that deliver nuclear warhead have also take we peacefully into space from that perspective we see our earth as it really be a small and fragile and beautiful blue globe the only home we have we see no barrier of race or religion or country we see the essential unity of our specie and our planet and with faith and common sense that bright vision will ultimately prevail

 another major challenge therefore be to protect the quality of this world within which we live the shadow that fall across the future be cast not only by the kind of weapon we have build but by the kind of world we will either nourish or neglect there be real and grow danger to our simple and our most precious possession the air we breathe the water we drink and the land which sustain we the rapid depletion of irreplaceable mineral the erosion of topsoil the destruction of beauty the blight of pollution the demand of increase billion of people all combine to create problem which be easy to observe and predict but difficult to resolve if we do not act the world of the year 2000 will be much less able to sustain life than it be now

 but there be no reason for despair acknowledge the physical reality of our planet do not mean a dismal future of endless sacrifice in fact acknowledge these reality be the first step in deal with they we can meet the resource problem of the world water food mineral farmland forest overpopulation pollution if we tackle they with courage and foresight

 i have just be talk about force of potential destruction that mankind have develop and how we might control they it be equally important that we remember the beneficial force that we have evolve over the age and how to hold fast to they one of those constructive force be the enhancement of individual human freedom through the strengthening of democracy and the fight against deprivation torture terrorism and the persecution of people throughout the world the struggle for human right override all difference of color or nation or language those who hunger for freedom who thirst for human dignity and who suffer for the sake of justice they be the patriot of this cause

 i believe with all my heart that america must always stand for these basic human right at home and abroad that be both our history and our destiny

 america do not invent human right in a very real sense it be the other way around human right invent america ours be the first nation in the history of the world to be found explicitly on such an idea our social and political progress have be base on one fundamental principle the value and importance of the individual the fundamental force that unite we be not kinship or place of origin or religious preference the love of liberty be the common blood that flow in our american vein

 the battle for human right at home and abroad be far from over we should never be surprised nor discourage because the impact of our effort have have and will always have varied result rather we should take pride that the ideal which give birth to our nation still inspire the hope of oppress people around the world we have no cause for self righteousness or complacency but we have every reason to persevere both within our own country and beyond our border

 if we be to serve as a beacon for human right we must continue to perfect here at home the right and the value which we espouse around the world a decent education for our child adequate medical care for all americans an end to discrimination against minority and woman a job for all those able to work and freedom from injustice and religious intolerance

 we live in a time of transition an uneasy era which be likely to endure for the rest of this century it will be a period of tension both within nation and between nation of competition for scarce resource of social political and economic stress and strain during this period we may be tempt to abandon some of the time honor principle and commitment which have be prove during the difficult time of past generation we must never yield to this temptation our american value be not luxury but necessity not the salt in our bread but the bread itself our common vision of a free and just society be our great source of cohesion at home and strength abroad great even than the bounty of our material blessing

 remember these word we hold these truth to be self evident that all man be create equal that they be endow by their creator with certain inalienable right that among these be life liberty and the pursuit of happiness

 this vision still grip the imagination of the world but we know that democracy be always an unfinished creation each generation must renew its foundation each generation must rediscover the meaning of this hallowed vision in the light of its own modern challenge for this generation our life be nuclear survival liberty be human right the pursuit of happiness be a planet whose resource be devoted to the physical and spiritual nourishment of its inhabitant

 during the next few day i will work hard to make sure that the transition from myself to the next president be a good one that the american people be serve well and i will continue as i have the last 14 month to work hard and to pray for the life and the well being of the american hostage hold in iran i can not predict yet what will happen but i hope you will join i in my constant prayer for their freedom

 as i return home to the south where i be bear and raise i look forward to the opportunity to reflect and far to assess i hope with accuracy the circumstance of our time i intend to give our new president my support and i intend to work as a citizen as i have work here in this office as president for the value this nation be found to secure

 again from the bottom of my heart i want to express to you the gratitude i feel thank you fellow citizen and farewell

senator hatfield mr. chief justice mr. president vice president bush vice president mondale senator baker speaker o'neill reverend moomaw and my fellow citizen
 to a few of we here today this be a solemn and most momentous occasion and yet in the history of our nation it be a commonplace occurrence the orderly transfer of authority as call for in the constitution routinely take place as it have for almost two century and few of we stop to think how unique we really be in the eye of ma in the world this every-4 year ceremony we accept as normal be nothing less than a miracle
 mr. president i want our fellow citizen to know how much you do to carry on this tradition by your gracious cooperation in the transition process you have show a watch world that we be a united people pledge to maintain a political system which guarantee individual liberty to a great degree than any other and i thank you and your people for all your help in maintain the continuity which be the bulwark of our republic
 the business of our nation go forward these united states be confront with an economic affliction of great proportion we suffer from the long and one of the bad sustained inflation in our national history it distort our economic decision penalize thrift and crush the struggle young and the fix income elderly alike it threaten to shatter the life of million of our people
 idle industry have cast worker into unemployment human misery and personal indignity those who do work be deny a fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalize successful achievement and keep we from maintain full productivity
 but great as our tax burden be it have not keep pace with public spending for decade we have pile deficit upon deficit mortgage our future and our child 's future for the temporary convenience of the present to continue this long trend be to guarantee tremendous social cultural political and economic upheaval
 you and i as individual can by borrow live beyond our mean but for only a limited period of time why then should we think that collectively as a nation we be not bind by that same limitation we must act today in order to preserve tomorrow and let there be no misunderstanding we be go to begin to act begin today
 the economic ill we suffer have come upon we over several decade they will not go away in day week or month but they will go away they will go away because we as americans have the capacity now as we have have in the past to do whatever need to be do to preserve this last and great bastion of freedom
 in this present crisis government be not the solution to our problem government be the problem from time to time we have be tempt to believe that society have become too complex to be manage by self rule that government by an elite group be superior to government for by and of the people well if no one among we be capable of govern himself then who among we have the capacity to govern someone else all of we together in and out of government must bear the burden the solution we seek must be equitable with no one group single out to pay a high price
 we hear much of special interest group well our concern must be for a special interest group that have be too long neglect it know no sectional boundary or ethnic and racial division and it cross political party line it be make up of man and woman who raise our food patrol our street man our mine and factory teach our child keep our home and heal we when we be sick professional industrialist shopkeeper clerk cabby and truckdriver they be in short we the people this breed call americans
 well this administration 's objective will be a healthy vigorous grow economy that provide equal opportunity for all americans with no barrier bear of bigotry or discrimination put america back to work mean put all americans back to work end inflation mean free all americans from the terror of runaway living cost all must share in the productive work of this new beginning and all must share in the bounty of a revive economy with the idealism and fair play which be the core of our system and our strength we can have a strong and prosperous america at peace with itself and the world
 so as we begin let we take inventory we be a nation that have a government not the other way around and this make we special among the nation of the earth our government have no power except that grant it by the people it be time to check and reverse the growth of government which show sign of having grow beyond the consent of the govern
 it be my intention to curb the size and influence of the federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the power grant to the federal government and those reserve to the states or to the people all of we need to be remind that the federal government do not create the states the states create the federal government
 now so there will be no misunderstanding it be not my intention to do away with government it be rather to make it work work with we not over we to stand by our side not ride on our back government can and must provide opportunity not smother it foster productivity not stifle it
 if we look to the answer as to why for so many year we achieve so much prosper as no other people on earth it be because here in this land we unleash the energy and individual genius of man to a great extent than have ever be do before freedom and the dignity of the individual have be more available and assure here than in any other place on earth the price for this freedom at time have be high but we have never be unwilling to pay that price
 it be no coincidence that our present trouble parallel and be proportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our life that result from unnecessary and excessive growth of government it be time for we to realize that we be too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dream we be not as some would have we believe doom to an inevitable decline i do not believe in a fate that will fall on we no matter what we do i do believe in a fate that will fall on we if we do nothing so with all the creative energy at our command let we begin an era of national renewal let we renew our determination our courage and our strength and let we renew our faith and our hope
 we have every right to dream heroic dream those who say that we be in a time when there be not hero they just do not know where to look you can see hero every day go in and out of factory gate other a handful in number produce enough food to feed all of we and then the world beyond you meet hero across a counter and they be on both side of that counter there be entrepreneur with faith in themselves and faith in an idea who create new job new wealth and opportunity they be individual and family whose taxis support the government and whose voluntary gift support church charity culture art and education their patriotism be quiet but deep their value sustain our national life
 now i have use the word they and their in speak of these hero i could say you and your because i be address the hero of whom i speak you the citizen of this bless land your dream your hope your goal be go to be the dream the hope and the goal of this administration so help i god
 we shall reflect the compassion that be so much a part of your makeup how can we love our country and not love our countryman and love they reach out a hand when they fall heal they when they be sick and provide opportunity to make they self sufficient so they will be equal in fact and not just in theory
 can we solve the problem confront we well the answer be an unequivocal and emphatic yes to paraphrase winston churchill i do not take the oath i have just take with the intention of preside over the dissolution of the world 's strong economy
 in the day ahead i will propose remove the roadblock that have slow our economy and reduce productivity step will be take aim at restore the balance between the various level of government progress may be slow measure in inch and foot not mile but we will progress it be time to reawaken this industrial giant to get government back within its mean and to lighten our punitive tax burden and these will be our first priority and on these principle there will be no compromise
 on the eve of our struggle for independence a man who might have be one of the great among the founding fathers dr. joseph warren president of the massachusetts congress say to his fellow americans our country be in danger but not to be despair of on you depend the fortune of america you be to decide the important question upon which rest the happiness and the liberty of million yet unborn act worthy of yourself
 well i believe we the americans of today be ready to act worthy of ourselves ready to do what must be do to ensure happiness and liberty for ourselves our child and our child 's child and as we renew ourselves here in our own land we will be see as have great strength throughout the world we will again be the exemplar of freedom and a beacon of hope for those who do not now have freedom
 to those neighbor and ally who share our freedom we will strengthen our historic tie and assure they of our support and firm commitment we will match loyalty with loyalty we will strive for mutually beneficial relation we will not use our friendship to impose on their sovereignty for our own sovereignty be not for sale
 as for the enemy of freedom those who be potential adversary they will be remind that peace be the high aspiration of the american people we will negotiate for it sacrifice for it we will not surrender for it now or ever
 our forbearance should never be misunderstood our reluctance for conflict should not be misjudge as a failure of will when action be require to preserve our national security we will act we will maintain sufficient strength to prevail if need be know that if we do so we have the good chance of never have to use that strength
 above all we must realize that no arsenal or no weapon in the arsenal of the world be so formidable as the will and moral courage of free man and woman it be a weapon our adversary in today 's world do not have it be a weapon that we as americans do have let that be understand by those who practice terrorism and prey upon their neighbor
 i be tell that ten of thousand of prayer meeting be be hold on this day and for that i be deeply grateful we be a nation under god and i believe god intend for we to be free it would be fitting and good i think if on each inaugural day in future year it should be declare a day of prayer
 this be the first time in our history that this ceremony have be hold as you have be tell on this west front of the capitol stand here one face a magnificent vista open up on this city 's special beauty and history at the end of this open mall be those shrine to the giant on whose shoulder we stand
 directly in front of i the monument to a monumental man george washington father of our country a man of humility who come to greatness reluctantly he lead america out of revolutionary victory into infant nationhood off to one side the stately memorial to thomas jefferson the declaration of independence flame with his eloquence and then beyond the reflect pool the dignified column of the lincoln memorial whoever would understand in his heart the meaning of america will find it in the life of abraham lincoln
 beyond those monument to heroism be the potomac river and on the far shore the slope hill of arlington national cemetery with its row upon row of simple white marker bear crosse or star of david they add up to only a tiny fraction of the price that have be pay for our freedom
 each one of those marker be a monument to the kind of hero i speak of early their life end in place call belleau wood the argonne omaha beach salerno and halfway around the world on guadalcanal tarawa pork chop hill the chosin reservoir and in a hundred rice paddy and jungle of a place call vietnam
 under one such marker lie a young man martin treptow who leave his job in a small town barbershop in 1917 to go to france with the famed rainbow division there on the western front he be kill try to carry a message between battalion under heavy artillery fire
 we be tell that on his body be find a diary on the flyleaf under the heading my pledge he have write these word america must win this war therefore i will work i will save i will sacrifice i will endure i will fight cheerfully and do my utmost as if the issue of the whole struggle depend on i alone
 the crisis we be face today do not require of we the kind of sacrifice that martin treptow and so many thousand of other be call upon to make it do require however our good effort and our willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in our capacity to perform great deed to believe that together with god 's help we can and will resolve the problem which now confront we
 and after all why should not we believe that we be americans
 god bless you and thank you

the president how do you do i have a brief opening statement here before i take your question

 yesterday secretary of the treasury donald regan send to the congress a request to raise the debt ceiling to $ 985 billion this represent a dramatic jump of $ 50 billion over the previous debt ceiling the administration take this action with great regret because it be clear that the massive deficit our government run be one of the root cause of our profound economic problem and for too many year this process have come too easily for we we have live beyond our mean and then finance our extravagance on the back of the american people

 the clear message i receive in the election campaign be that we must gain control of this inflationary monster

 let i briefly review for the american people what we have already do within moment of take the oath of office i place a freeze on the hiring of civilian employee in the federal government two day later i issue an order to cut down on government travel reduce the number of consultant to the government stop the procurement of certain item and call on my appointee to exercise restraint in their own office yesterday i announce the elimination of remain federal control on u.s. oil production and marketing

 today i be announce two more action to reduce the size of the federal government

 first i be take major step toward the elimination of the council on wage and price stability this council have be a failure it have be totally ineffective in control inflation and it be impose unnecessary burden on labor and business therefore i be now end the wage and price program of the council i be eliminate the staff that carry out its wage pricing activity and i be ask congress to rescind its budget save the taxpayer some $ 1 million a year

 my second decision today be a directive order key federal agency to freeze pende regulation for 60 day this action give my administration time to start a new regulatory oversight process and also prevent certain last minute regulatory decision of the previous administration the so call midnight regulation from take effect without proper review and approval

 all of we should remember that the federal government be not some mysterious institution comprise of building file and paper the people be the government what we create we ought to be able to control i do not intend to make wildly skyrocket deficit and runaway government simple fact of life in this administration as i have say our ill have come upon we over several decade and they will not go away in day or week or month but i want the american people to know that we have begin

 now i will be happy to take your question helen helen thomas united press international

 q mr. president will your policy toward iran be one of revenge or reconciliation and will the united states honor the recent commitment to iran especially since you approve of most of they during the campaign

 the president well i be certainly not think of revenge and i do not know whether reconciliation would be possible with the present government or absence of a government in iran

 i think that the united states will honor the obligation as a matter of fact the most important of those be already put into effect by the precede administration in negotiate the release we be however study because there be four major agreement and there be nine executive order and we be study thoroughly what be a pretty complex matter we have discover with regard to whether they be in keep with international and our own national law and so i will not be able to really answer your question on specific until we have complete that study

 q mr. president the treasury secretary say monday that your budget cut will be of a much high magnitude than most people think they would be you say they would be across the board now that you have have some time to study the budget can you say where these cut will be make what program will feel the cut the most

 the president they will be make every place maybe across the board be the wrong decision although it describe it what i mean be that no one be exempt from be look at for area in which we can make cut in spending

 and yes they probably be go to be big than anyone have ever attempt because this administration do not come here to be a caretaker government and just hope we could go along the same way and maybe do it a little well we think the time have come where there have to be a change of direction of this country and it be go to begin with reduce government spending

 q mr. president in your welcoming address to the freed americans you sound a warning of swift and effective retribution in future terrorist situation what kind of action be you prepared to take to back up this hard rhetoric

 the president well that be a question that i do not think you can or should answer as to specific this be a big and it be a powerful nation it have a lot of option open to it and to try and specify now just particularly what you should do i think be one of the thing that be be wrong

 people have go to bed in some of these country that have do these thing to we in the past confident that they can go to sleep wake up in the morning and the united states would not have take any action what i mean by that phrase be that anyone who do these thing violate our right in the future be not go to be able to go to bed with that confidence

 q mr. president you campaign rather vociferously against the salt ii treaty say it be slightly toward the soviet union yet i notice your secretary of state mr. haig now seem to suggest that for the time be at least the united states will abide by the limit of the salt ii treaty and he hope the soviet union will too how long do you intend that the united states should abide by the term of a salt agreement which you consider inequitable and what do you consider its great inequity to be

 the president well the salt treaty first of all i think permit a continued buildup on both side of strategic nuclear weapon but in the main thing authorize an immediate increase in large number of soviet warhead there be no verification as to the number of warhead on the missile no method for we to do this

 i do not think that a treaty salt mean strategic arm limitation that actually permit a buildup on both side of strategic nuclear weapon can properly be call that and i have say that when we can and i be willing for our people to go in to negotiate or let i say discussion lead to negotiation that we should start negotiate on the basis of try to effect an actual reduction in the number of nuclear weapon that would then be real strategic arm limitation

 and i happen to believe also that you can not sit down at a table and just negotiate that unless you take into account in consideration at that table all the other thing that be go on in other word i believe in linkage

 sam sam donaldson abc news

 q mr. president what do you see as the long range intention of the soviet union do you think for instance the kremlin be bent on world domination that might lead to a continuation of the cold war or do you think that under other circumstance detente be possible

 the president well so far detente 's be a one way street that the soviet union have use to pursue its own aim i do not have to think of an answer as to what i think their intention be they have repeat it i know of no leader of the soviet union since the revolution and include the present leadership that have not more than once repeat in the various communist congress they hold their determination that their goal must be the promotion of world revolution and a one world socialist or communist state whichever word you want to use

 now as long as they do that and as long as they at the same time have openly and publicly declare that the only morality they recognize be what will further their cause mean they reserve unto themselves the right to commit any crime to lie to cheat in order to attain that and that be moral not immoral and we operate on a different set of standard i think when you do business with they even at a detente you keep that in mind

 q mr. president what be your opinion of american company that now want to resume business with iran

 the president my opinion of american company that want to resume business with iran i hope they be go to do it by long distance laughter we would not want to go back to have just a different cast of character but the same show go on laughter

 i can understand that particularly in the field of energy their wanting to do that but we be urge the people to think long and hard before they travel to iran because we do not think their safety can be guarantee there

 q mr. president three americans be still incarcerate in vietnam iran can you tell we the status of their case and whether the administration be do anything to get they back

 the president i have tell our people about those three they know about they of course but i have tell they that yes we continue and we want to get they back also

 now i know i have be stay down front here too much i have get to prove i can look at the back row there you sir

 q okay mr. president some administrative official have promise adherence to the civil right law which be on the book but there have be considerable discussion about dismantle the affirmative action aspect that give those law to some people great meaning and i be wonder mr. president that if there will be a retreat in the federal government on the government 's advocacy of affirmative action program generally and in federal hiring of black and hispanics specifically

 the president no there will be no retreat this administration be go to be dedicate to equality i think we have make great progress in the civil right field i think there be some thing however that may not be as useful as they once be or that may even be distort in the practice such as some affirmative action program become quota system and i be old enough to remember when quota exist in the united states for the purpose of discrimination and i do not want to see that happen again

 q mr. president when and how will you seek the decontrol of natural gas price

 the president well we have not deal with that problem yet we think oil would do for a starter but i can not really answer your question that will be a matter for discussion in future cabinet meeting lou lou cannon washington post

 q mr. president during the campaign you repeatedly talk about the unfairness of the grain embargo as you see it do you have second thought now or will you lift the grain embargo

 the president well with the grain embargo my quarrel with it from the first be that i think it be ask only one group of americans to participate the farmer

 you only have two choice with an embargo you either lift it or you broaden it and we have not make a decision except that at the request of secretary of agriculture john block i have take the matter of the embargo out of you might say the discussion of the national security council and it next week be on the agenda for a full cabinet meeting as to what our course will be so i can not answer what we do about it until next week

 as i say it be ask one group of americans to bear the burden and i have always think be more of a kind of gesture than it be something real

 yes ma'am

 q mr. president what will you do to honor the request from atlanta official for you and the federal government to intercede in the atlanta case of 17 miss black child

 the president just a few minute before i come in here that message be hand to i that the atlanta mayor want to talk and we be go to get someone in touch with he immediately now you recognize of course that possibly civil right would be the only basis upon which we could have any jurisdiction down there in this for fbi for example on any other thing there be be no evidence of cross state line or anything and yet we want to be helpful because that be a most tragic case and so we will be meet on that very shortly

 q mr. president when the jamaican prime minister be here yesterday mr. seaga he suggest publicly that now might be a good time for you as the new president to have a foreign policy initiative for latin america and for the caribbean do you intend to follow that suggestion and if so how would your policy differ from those of former president carter

 the president well i think we have see a great reverse in the caribbean situation and it come about through prime minister seaga 's election it be the turnover or turn around of a nation that have go certainly in the direction of the communist movement it be a protege of castro and his election be greet by i with great enthusiasm because it represent the people by their vote having experience that kind of government turn another direction

 and i think this open the door for we to have a policy in the mediterranean of bring they back in those country that might have start in that direction or keep they in the western world in the free world and so we be look forward to cooperation with prime minister seaga

 q mr. president i think you mean caribbean in that last answer rather than mediterranean

 the president what would i say

 q mediterranean

 the president oh i mean caribbean i be sorry

 q what do you intend to do mr. president about the draft registration law that be pass during president carter 's administration and in view of your opposition to it in the campaign how be that consistent with your avow intention to strengthen our national defense

 the president well to answer the last part first i just do not feel that the advance registration on all the evidence we could get would materially speed up the process if an emergency require the draft it do create a bureaucracy it cause certainly some unrest and dissatisfaction and we be tell that it would only be a matter of several day if we have to call up in a draft that we could do that several day early with the registration than we would be able if there be no registration at all

 this be one that be something to be look at far down i have only be here 9 day and most of these 9 day have be spend in cabinet meeting on the economy get ready to send our package up to the hill and so i just have to tell you that we will be deal with that meet with that and make a decision on what to do with it down the road someplace

 gary gary schuster detroit news

 q mr. president speak of your economic package can you give we your thought on an effective date for the tax cut that you plan to recommend in your economic recovery plan and specify whether you prefer one effective date for business and another for personal cut or whether you would like to combine they

 the president i would like to see it all go forward all at once as to date i know there be be talk about whether it should be retroactive back or whether it should be as of that minute that to i be not as important as get for individual the principle of a 10 percent cut for each of 3 year in place and the business taxis also so that we can all look forward with some confidence of stability in the program and we be go to strive for that and i can not really answer you about what the date will be until we submit the package

 q mr. president i know you say early that you be not think of revenge toward iran but do that preclude any punishment whatsoever for what they have do

 the president well again i have to ask your forbearance and wait until we have finish our study of this whole situation as to what we be go to do i do not think any of we have a friendly feeling toward the people that have do what they have do but i think it be too complex for i to answer until we have have time to really study this

 q mr. president just one follow up would you go so far as to encourage american business to resume commercial trade with iran

 the president at this point no

 q mr. president do you intend to follow through with your campaign pledge to abolish the departments of energy and education

 the president i have not retreat from that at all yes the process however that i have ask for be for both secretary bell of education and secretary jim edwards of energy to reorganize to produce the most effective streamlining of their departments that they can in education to look at the appropriate role of the federal government in education if there be one and to report back and then we will decide make our recommendation much the same thing hold true with the department of energy the reason for this being that while they be new cabinet level agency they incorporate government function and program that have be go on in they and they come under that umbrella and we have to find out which of those function that have be a federal government function continue and where they would well fit

 but yes i be determine and i believe that it be wrong to have create the two agency to begin with

 q mr. president during the campaign your chief farm spokesman put you on record as favor for the time being continuation of the dairy price support level where it have be within the last couple of day your budget director and your secretary of agriculture have indicate that the dairy program be too expensive and should be cut back could you reconcile those difference of approach for we

 the president well i could only tell you that this again be something to wait for the next cabinet meeting all of these thing be work out between the appropriate cabinet member and our director of omb and then they come to the cabinet for full discussion so that other who have an interest in this can have their input and so i can not answer you because that have not yet come to the cabinet

 q mr. president iran and the soviet union share a long border in a region vital to the future stability of the world give the anti u.s. sentiment there how do you well think the united states can ensure the stability of the region the persian gulf region

 the president of the you say iran the border between iran and the soviet union

 well i think one of the first thing that have to happen for stability have get to be in iran itself to establish a government that can speak as a government for iran and part of our problem in all these long 444 day have be the inability of anyone seemingly to speak for that nation to have a government now i think that any country would want to help another if they really show an intent to have a government that would abide by international law and do what they could to help they in that regard but until such a thing appear apparent there i do not know that there be anything we can do

 q mr. president if it be your intention to signal the world that this country will respond with swift retribution in case of international terrorism in the future why be it your policy not to retaliate against iran

 the president well what good would just revenge do and what form would that take i do not think revenge be worthy of we on the other hand i do not think we act as if this never happen and i would rather wait until as i say we complete this study

 who say i know i have be on this side too long but someone say por favor laughter

 q mr. president still i be impressed when i listen the other day viva la roja la blanca y azul mr. president it be true that when hispanics be give the opportunity to serve this country they serve the country with diligence and dispatch in view of this undisputed fact when be you go to appoint hispanic americans to serve in your administration in policy make position

 the president we be definitely recruit and definitely try to do that i want an administration that will be representative of the country as a whole and please do not judge we on the fact that we have only pick a hundred there will be 1,700 position to fill in the executive branch and the white house senior staff and staff and the personnel committee in our administration that be talent hunting and look for these people contain member of the minority hispanics and even a majority of woman and we want that very much so do not judge we now by the tip of the iceberg wait till it be all in

 q. mr. president yes thank you

 mr. president paul volcker the chairman of the federal reserve board have be implement policy that be exactly opposite in basic thrust from what you recommend he have be squeeze the productive sector of the economy in favor of the speculative sector now i mean frankly mr. president there be important section of the american economy that be about to go under and will not even have an opportunity to benefit from the program that you be put forward because of the federal reserve policy

 q i have a two part question first of all do you think that objective economic condition justify the interest rate level that we now have and i do not mean for your answer to imply criticism of the fed it be just an objective question and the second question be be you concerned that there might be a sabotage so to speak of your policy by program that the federal reserve might be put forward

 the president no i be not concerned that there would be sabotage i have meet with mr. volcker and not with the intention of try to dictate because it be an independent agency and i respect that

 but i think that we have to face the fact that interest rate be not in themselves a cause of inflation they be a consequence and when you have as we have have double digit inflation back to back for 2 solid year now the last time that happen be in world war i and when you have double digit inflation there that way there be no question that interest rate be go to have to go up and follow that inflation rate

 and so the answer to the interest rate be go to be our program of reduce government spending tie to the reduction of the tax rate that we have speak of to bring down inflation and you will find that interest rate come down we do want from the fed and would ask for a moderate policy of money supply increase relative to legitimate growth all of these thing have to work together but i do not think that the fed just deliberately raise interest rate

 the reason that we have get to tie taxis and we have to tie spending together be we for all these decade we have talk and we have talk about solve these problem and we have act as if the two be separate so one year we fight inflation and then unemployment go up and then the next year we fight unemployment and inflation go up it be time to keep the two together where they belong and that be what we be go to do yes sir

 q mr. president a number of conservative leader among they some of your staunch and most durable supporter such as senator jesse helms be very concerned about some of your appointment

 the basis of the concern be that many people who have be longtime reaganites and supporter of yours do not seem to be able to get job like bill van cleave who play a key role on your defense transition team whereas other individual who have not support you throughout the year or your philosophy like mr. terrel bell the secretary of education who be for the establishment of the department which you have say you be go to abolish when mr. frank carlucci deputy secretary of defense who be not a supporter of your that they have get job

 my question be why be these individual in your administration why be not mr. van cleave and how much of a problem do you think this conservative dissatisfaction with your appointment be

 the president the only problem that i have have that be more difficult than know which hand raise to point to here and believe i it bother i i go home feel guilty for all the hand that i could not point to laughter the only problem great i have have be in the selection of personnel

 now in many instance some of the people that have be mention whose name that have be mention by other do not want a position in the administration help work very hard and want nothing for it but you also have to recognize there be not that many position after all look how many vote i have you can not reward they all

 ms. thomas thank you mr. president

 the president thank you all right thank you all very much





mr. speaker mr. president distinguished members of the congress honored guest and fellow citizen

 i have no word to express my appreciation for that greeting

 i have come to speak to you tonight about our economic recovery program and why i believe it be essential that the congress approve this package which i believe will lift the crush burden of inflation off of our citizen and restore the vitality to our economy and our industrial machine

 first however and due to event of the past few week will you permit i to digress for a moment from the all important subject of why we must bring government spending under control and reduce tax rate i would like to say a few word directly to all of you and to those who be watch and listen tonight because this be the only way i know to express to all of you on behalf of nancy and myself our appreciation for your message and flower and most of all your prayer not only for i but for those other who fall beside i

 the warmth of your word the expression of friendship and yes love mean more to we than you can ever know you have give we a memory that we will treasure forever and you have provide an answer to those few voice that be raise say that what happen be evidence that ours be a sick society

 the society we hear from be make up of million of compassionate americans and their child from college age to kindergarten as a matter of fact as evidence of that i have a letter with i the letter come from peter sweeney he be in the second grade in the riverside school in rockville centre and he say i hope you get well quick or you might have to make a speech in your pajama laughter he add a postscript p.s. if you have to make a speech in your pajama i warn you laughter

 well sick society do not produce man like the two who recently return from outer space sick society do not produce young man like secret service agent tim mccarthy who place his body between mine and the man with the gun simply because he feel that be what his duty call for he to do sick society do not produce dedicated police officer like tom delahanty or able and devoted public servant like jim brady sick society do not make people like we so proud to be americans and so very proud of our fellow citizen

 now let us talk about get spending and inflation under control and cut your tax rate

 mr. speaker and senator baker i want to thank you for your cooperation in help to arrange this joint session of the congress i will not be speak to you very long tonight but i ask for this meeting because the urgency of our joint mission have not change

 thank to some very fine people my health be much improve i would like to be able to say that with regard to the health of the economy

 it be be half a year since the election that charge all of we in this government with the task of restore our economy where have we come in this 6 month inflation as measure by the consumer price index have continue at a double digit rate mortgage interest rate have average almost 15 percent for these 6 month prevent family across america from buy home there be still almost 8 million unemployed the average worker 's hourly earning after adjust for inflation be low today than they be 6 month ago and there have be over 6,000 business failure

 six month be long enough the american people now want we to act and not in half measure they demand and they have earn a full and comprehensive effort to clean up our economic mess because of the extent of our economy 's sickness we know that the cure will not come quickly and that even with our package progress will come in inch and foot not in mile but to fail to act will delay even long and more painfully the cure which must come and that cure begin with the federal budget and the budgetary action take by the congress over the next few day will determine how we respond to the message of last november 4th that message be very simple our government be too big and it spend too much

 for the last few month you and i have enjoy a relationship base on extraordinary cooperation because of this cooperation we have come a long distance in less than 3 month i want to thank the leadership of the congress for help in set a fair timetable for consideration of our recommendation and committee chairman on both side of the aisle have call prompt and thorough hearing

 we have also communicate in a spirit of candor openness and mutual respect tonight as our decision day near and as the house of representatives weigh its alternative i wish to address you in that same spirit

 the senate budget committee under the leadership of pete domenici have just today vote out a budget resolution support by democrats and republicans alike that be in all major respect consistent with the program that we have propose now we look forward to favorable action on the senate floor but an equally crucial test involve the house of representatives

 the house will soon be choose between two different version or measure to deal with the economy one be the measure offer by the house budget committee the other be a bipartisan measure a substitute introduce by congressmen phil gramm of texas and del latta of ohio

 on behalf of the administration let i say that we embrace and fully support that bipartisan substitute it will achieve all the essential aim of control government spending reduce the tax burden build a national defense second to none and stimulate economic growth and create million of new job

 at the same time however i must state our opposition to the measure offer by the house budget committee it may appear that we have two alternative in reality however there be no more alternative leave the committee measure quite simply fall far too short of the essential action that we must take

 for example in the next 3 year the committee measure project spend $ 141 billion more than do the bipartisan substitute it regrettably cut over $ 14 billion in essential defense spending funding require to restore america 's national security it adhere to the fail policy of try to balance the budget on the taxpayer 's back it would increase tax payment by over a third add up to a staggering quarter of a trillion dollar federal taxis would increase 12 percent each year taxpayer would be pay a large share of their income to government in 1984 than they do at present

 in short that measure reflect an echo of the past rather than a benchmark for the future high taxis and excess spending growth create our present economic mess more of the same will not cure the hardship anxiety and discouragement it have impose on the american people

 let we cut through the fog for a moment the answer to a government that be too big be to stop feed its growth government spending have be grow fast than the economy itself the massive national debt which we accumulate be the result of the government 's high spending diet well it be time to change the diet and to change it in the right way

 i know the tax portion of our package be of concern to some of you let i make a few point that i feel have be overlook first of all it should be look at as an integral part of the entire package not something separate and apart from the budget reduction the regulatory relief and the monetary restraint probably the most common misconception be that we be propose to reduce government revenue to less than what the government have be receive this be not true actually the discussion have to do with how much of a tax increase should be impose on the taxpayer in 1982

 now i know that over the recess in some informal polling some of your constituent have be ask which they would rather have a balanced budget or a tax cut and with the common sense that characterize the people of this country the answer of course have be a balanced budget but may i suggest with no inference that there be wrong intent on the part of those who ask the question the question be inappropriate to the situation

 our choice be not between a balanced budget and a tax cut properly ask the question be do you want a great big raise in your taxis this coming year or at the bad a very little increase with the prospect of tax reduction and a balanced budget down the road a way with the common sense that the people have already show i be sure we all know what the answer to that question would be

 a gigantic tax increase have be build into the system we propose nothing more than a reduction of that increase the people have a right to know that even with our plan they will be pay more in taxis but not as much more as they will without it

 the option i believe offer by the house budget committee will leave spend too high and tax rate too high at the same time i think it cut the defense budget too much and by attempt to reduce the deficit through high taxis it will not create the kind of strong economic growth and the new job that we must have

 let we not overlook the fact that the small independent business man or woman create more than 80 percent of all the new job and employ more than half of our total work force our across the board cut in tax rate for a 3 year period will give they much of the incentive and promise of stability they need to go forward with expansion plan call for additional employee

 tonight i renew my call for we to work as a team to join in cooperation so that we find answer which will begin to solve all our economic problem and not just some of they the economic recovery package that i have outline to you over the past week be i deeply believe the only answer that we have leave

 reduce the growth of spending cut marginal tax rate provide relief from overregulation and follow a noninflationary and predictable monetary policy be interweave measure which will ensure that we have address each of the severe dislocation which threaten our economic future these policy will make our economy strong and the strong economy will balance the budget which we be committed to do by 1984

 when i take the oath of office i pledge loyalty to only one special interest group—“we the people those people neighbor and friend shopkeeper and laborer farmer and craftsman do not have infinite patience as a matter fact some 80 year ago teddy roosevelt write these instructive word in his first message to the congress the american people be slow to wrath but when their wrath be once kindle it burn like a consume flame well perhaps that kind of wrath will be deserve if our answer to these serious problem be to repeat the mistake of the past

 the old and comfortable way be to shave a little here and add a little there well that be not acceptable anymore i think this great and historic congress know that way be no long acceptable applause

 thank you very much

 i think you have show that you know the one sure way to continue the inflationary spiral be to fall back into the predictable pattern of old economic practice be not it time that we try something new

 when you allow i to speak to you here in these chamber a little early i tell you that i want this program for economic recovery to be our your and mine i think the bipartisan substitute bill have achieve that purpose it move we toward economic vitality

 just two week ago you and i join million of our fellow americans in marvel at the magic historical moment that john young and bob crippen create in their space shuttle columbia the last manned effort be almost 6 year ago and i remember on this more recent day over the year how we would all come to expect technological precision of our man and machine and each amazing achievement become commonplace until the next new challenge be raise

 with the space shuttle we test our ingenuity once again move beyond the accomplishment of the past into the promise and uncertainty of the future thus we not only plan to send up a 122 foot aircraft 170 mile into space but we also intend to make it maneuverable and return it to earth land 98 ton of exotic metal delicately on a remote dry lake bed the space shuttle do more than prove our technological ability it raise our expectation once more it start we dream again

 the poet carl sandburg write the republic be a dream nothing happen unless first a dream and that be what make we as americans different we have always reach for a new spirit and aim at a high goal we have be courageous and determined unafraid and bold who among we want to be first to say we no long have those quality that we must limp along do the same thing that have bring we our present misery

 i believe that the people you and i represent be ready to chart a new course they look to we to meet the great challenge to reach beyond the commonplace and not fall short for lack of creativity or courage

 someone you know have say that he who would have nothing to do with thorn must never attempt to gather flower well we have much greatness before we we can restore our economic strength and build opportunity like none we have ever have before

 as carl sandburg say all we need to begin with be a dream that we can do well than before all we need to have be faith and that dream will come true all we need to do be act and the time for action be now

 thank you good night

father hesburgh i thank you very much and for so many thing the distinguished honor that you have confer upon i here today i must say however compound a sense of guilt that i have nurse for almost 50 year i think the first degree i be give be honorary but it be wonderful to be here today with governor orr governor bowen senators lugar and quayle and representative hiler these distinguished honoree the trustee administration faculty student and friend of notre dame and most important the graduate class of 1981



 nancy and i be greatly honor to share this day with you and our pleasure have be more than double because i be also share the platform with a longtime and very dear friend pat o'brien

 pat and i have not be able to see much of each other lately so i have not have a chance to tell he that there be now another tie that bind we together until a few week ago i know very little about my father 's ancestry he have be orphan at age 6 but now i have learn that his grandfather my great grandfather leave ireland to come to america leave his home in ballyporeen a village in county tipperary in ireland and i have learn that ballyporeen be the ancestral home of the o'briens

 now if i do not watch out this may turn out to be less of a commencement than a warm bath in nostalgic memory grow up in illinois i be influence by a sport legend so national in scope it be almost mystical it be difficult to explain to anyone who do not live in those time the legend be base on a combination of three element a game football a university notre dame and a man knute rockne there have be nothing like it before or since

 my first time to ever see notre dame be to come here as a sport announcer 2 year out of college to broadcast a football game you win or i would not have mention it

 a number of year later i return here in the company of pat o'brien and a galaxy of hollywood star for the world premiere of knute rockne all american in which i be privileged to play george gipp i have always suspect that there might have be many actor in hollywood who could have play the part well but no one could have want to play it more than i do and i be give the part largely because the star of that picture pat o'brien kindly and generously hold out a help hand to a begin young actor

 having come from the world of sport i would be try to write a story about knute rockne i must confess that i have someone in mind to play the gipper on one of my sport broadcast before go to hollywood i have tell the story of his career and tragic death i do not have very many word on paper when i learn that the studio that employ i be already prepare a story treatment for that film and that bring i to the theme of my remark

 i be the fifth president of the united states to address a notre dame commencement the temptation be great to use this forum as an address on a great international or national issue that have nothing to do with this occasion indeed this be somewhat traditional so i be not surprised when i read in several reputable journal that i be go to deliver an address on foreign policy or on the economy i be not go to talk about either

 but by the same token i will try not to belabor you with some of the standard rhetoric that be belove of graduation speaker for example i be not go to tell you that you know more today that you have ever know before or that you will ever know again the other standby be when i be 14 i do not think my father know anything by the time i be 21 i be amazed at how much the old gentleman have learn in 7 year and then of course the traditional and the standby be that a university like this be a storehouse of knowledge because the freshman bring so much in and the senior take so little away

 you member of the graduate class of 18 or 1981 i do not really go back that far be what behaviorist call achiever and while you will look back with warm pleasure on your memory of these year that bring you here to where you be today you be also i know look at the future that seem uncertain to most of you but which let i assure you offer great expectation

 take pride in this day thank your parent as one on your behalf have already do here thank those who have be of help to you over the last 4 year and do a little celebrating you be entitle this be your day and whatever i say should take cognizance of that fact it be a milestone in life and it mark a time of change

 winston churchill during the dark period of the battle of britain in world war ii say when great cause be on the move in the world we learn we be spirit not animal and that something be go on in space and time and beyond space and time which whether we like it or not spell duty

 now i be go to mention again that movie that pat and i and notre dame be in because it say something about america first knute rockne as a boy come to america with his parent from norway and in the few year it take he to grow up to college age he become so american that here at notre dame he become an all american in a game that be still to this day uniquely american

 as a coach he do more than teach young man how to play a game he believe truly that the noble work of man be build the character of man and maybe that be why he be a living legend no man connect with football have ever achieve the stature or occupy the singular niche in the nation that he carve out for himself not just in a sport but in our entire social structure

 now today i hear very often win one for the gipper speak in a humorous vein lately i have be hear it by congressman who be supportive of the program that i have introduce but let us look at the significance of that story rockne could have use gipp 's die word to win a game any time but 8 year go by follow the death of george gipp before rock reveal those die word his deathbed wish

 and then he tell the story at halftime to a team that be lose and one of the only team he have ever coach that be tear by dissension and jealousy and factionalism the senior on that team be about to close out their football career without learn or experience any of the real value that a game have to impart none of they have know george gipp they be child when he play for notre dame it be to this team that rockne tell the story and so inspire they that they rise above their personal animosity for someone they have never know they join together in a common cause and attain the unattainable

 we be tell when we be make the picture of one line that be speak by a player during that game we be actually afraid to put it in the picture the man who carry the ball over for the win touchdown be injure on the play we be tell that as he be lift on the stretcher and carry off the field he be hear to say that be the last one i can get for you gipper

 now it be only a game and maybe to hear it now afterward and this be what we fear it might sound maudlin and not the way it be intend but be there anything wrong with young people have an experience feel something so deeply think of someone else to the point that they can give so completely of themselves there will come time in the life of all of we when we will be face with cause big than ourselves and they will not be on a playing field

 this nation be bear when a band of man the founding fathers a group so unique we have never see their like since rise to such selfless height lawyer tradesman merchant farmers—56 man achieve security and stand in life but value freedom more they pledge their life their fortune and their sacred honor sixteen of they give their life most give their fortune all preserve their sacred honor

 they give we more than a nation they bring to all mankind for the first time the concept that man be bear free that each of we have inalienable right our by the grace of god and that government be create by we for our convenience have only the power that we choose to give it this be the heritage that you be about to claim as you come out to join the society make up of those who have precede you by a few year or some of we by a great many

 this experiment in man 's relation to man be a few year into its third century say that may make it sound quite old but let us look at it from another viewpoint or perspective a few year ago someone figure out that if you could condense the entire history of life on earth into a motion picture that would run for 24 hour a day 365 day maybe on leap year we could have an intermission this idea that be the united states would not appear on the screen until 31/2 second before midnight on december 31st and in those 3 second not only would a new concept of society come into being a golden hope for all mankind but more than half the activity economic activity in world history would take place on this continent free to express their genius individual americans man and woman in 3 1/2 second would perform such miracle of invention construction and production as the world have never see

 as you join we out there beyond the campus you know there be great unsolved problem federalism with its build in check and balance have be distort central government have usurped power that properly belong to local and state government and in so do in many way that central government have begin to fail to do the thing that be truly the responsibility of a central government

 all of this have lead to the misuse of power and preemption of the prerogative of people and their social institution you be graduate from a great private or if you will independent university not too many year ago such school be relatively free from government interference in recent year government have spawn regulation cover virtually every facet of our life the independent and church support college and university have find themselves enmesh in that network of regulation and the costly blizzard of paperwork that government be demand thirty four congressional committee and almost 80 subcommittee have jurisdiction over 439 separate law affect education at the college level alone almost every aspect of campus life be now regulate hiring firing promotion physical plant construction record keeping fund raising and to some extent curriculum and educational program

 i hope when you leave this campus that you will do so with a feeling of obligation to your alma mater she will need your help and support in the year to come if ever the great independent college and university like notre dame give way to and be replace by tax support institution the struggle to preserve academic freedom will have be lose

 we be troubled today by economic stagnation bring on by inflated currency and prohibitive taxis and burdensome regulation the cost of stagnation in human term mostly among those least equip to survive it be cruel and inhuman

 now after those remark do not decide that you would well turn your diploma back in so you can stay another year on the campus i have just give you the bad news the good news be that something be be do about all this because the people of america have say enough already you know we who have precede you have just get so busy that we let thing get out of hand we forget that we be the keeper of the power forget to challenge the notion that the state be the principal vehicle of social change forget that million of social interaction among free individual and institution can do more to foster economic and social progress than all the careful scheme of government planner

 well at last we be remember remember that government have certain legitimate function which it can perform very well that it can be responsive to the people that it can be humane and compassionate but that when it undertake task that be not its proper province it can do none of they as well or as economically as the private sector

 for too long government have be fix thing that be not break and invent miracle cure for unknown disease

 we need you we need your youth we need your strength we need your idealism to help we make right that which be wrong now i know that this period of your life you have be and be critically look at the more and custom of the past and question their value every generation do that may i suggest do not discard the time test value upon which civilization be build simply because they be old more important do not let today 's doom crier and cynic persuade you that the good be past that from here on it be all downhill each generation see far than the generation that precede it because it stand on the shoulder of that generation you be go to have opportunity beyond anything that we have ever know

 the people have make it plain already they want an end to excessive government intervention in their life and in the economy an end to the burdensome and unnecessary regulation and a punitive tax policy that do take from the mouth of labor the bread it have earn they want a government that can not only continue to send man across the vast reach of space and bring they safely home but that can guarantee that you and i can walk in the park of our neighborhood after dark and get safely home and finally they want to know that this nation have the ability to defend itself against those who would seek to pull it down

 and all of this we the people can do indeed a start have already be make there be a task force under the leadership of the vice president george bush that be to look at those regulation i have speak of they have already identify hundred of they that can be wipe out with no harm to the quality of life and the cancellation of just those regulation will leave billion and billion of dollar in the hand of the people for productive enterprise and research and development and the creation of job

 the year ahead be great one for this country for the cause of freedom and the spread of civilization the west will not contain communism it will transcend communism it will not bother to dismiss or denounce it it will dismiss it as some bizarre chapter in human history whose last page be even now be write

 william faulkner at a nobel prize ceremony some time back say man would not only merely endure he will prevail against the modern world because he will return to the old verity and truth of the heart and then faulkner say of man he be immortal because he alone among creature have a soul a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance

 one can not say those word compassion sacrifice and endurance without thinking of the irony that one who so exemplify they pope john paul ii a man of peace and goodness an inspiration to the world would be strike by a bullet from a man towards whom he could only feel compassion and love it be pope john paul ii who warn in last year 's encyclical on mercy and justice against certain economic theory that use the rhetoric of class struggle to justify injustice he say in the name of an alleged justice the neighbor be sometimes destroy kill deprive of liberty or strip of fundamental human right

 for the west for america the time have come to dare to show to the world that our civilized idea our tradition our value be not like the ideology and war machine of totalitarian society just a facade of strength it be time for the world to know our intellectual and spiritual value be root in the source of all strength a belief in a supreme being and a law high than our own

 when it be write history of our time will not dwell long on the hardship of the recent past but history will ask and our answer determine the fate of freedom for a thousand year do a nation bear of hope lose hope do a people forge by courage find courage wanting do a generation steel by hard war and a harsh peace forsake honor at the moment of great climactic struggle for the human spirit

 if history ask such question it also answer they and the answer be to be find in the heritage leave by generation of americans before we they stand in silent witness to what the world will soon know and history someday record that in the its third century the american nation come of age affirm its leadership of free man and woman serve selflessly a vision of man with god government for people and humanity at peace

 a few year ago an australian prime minister john gorton say i wonder if anybody ever think what the situation for the comparatively small nation in the world would be if there be not in existence the united states if there be not this giant country prepare to make so many sacrifice this be the noble and rich heritage root in great civil idea of the west and it be your

 my hope today be that in the year to come and come it shall when it be your time to explain to another generation the meaning of the past and thereby hold out to they their promise of the future that you will recall the truth and tradition of which we have speak it be these truth and tradition that define our civilization and make up our national heritage and now they be yours to protect and pass on

 i have one more hope for you when you do speak to the next generation about these thing that you will always be able to speak of an america that be strong and free to find in your heart an unbounded pride in this much love country this once and future land this bright and hopeful nation whose generous spirit and great ideal the world still honor

 congratulation and god bless you



chairwoman margaret bush wilson i thank you very much for that introduction and that explanation also of my year 's tardiness in get here

 i remember a year ago i be in california when i receive your invitation at the same time that i receive a clipping that i have not answer your invitation now at that moment it be almost impossible for i well it be impossible to find a way not even air force one could have bridge from california to florida but i be delighted that this time as you say there be well staff work and i be able to get the invitation in plenty of time

 president cobb vice chairman kelly alexander and executive director benjamin hooks the lady and gentleman here on the platform the member of the board of director and you lady and gentleman representative to this convention

 i be very happy to be talk to the naacp 's 72rd annual convention

 there be many thing that we need to discuss and i thank you for the invitation to do so let we talk today about the need of the future not the misunderstanding of the past about new idea not old one about what must become a continue dialog not a dialog that flow only at intermittent convention that we both attend

 part of that continue dialog take place last tuesday when i meet with ben hooks and margaret bush wilson in the oval office our discussion be candid and useful the wide range of our conversation show that there be a great deal to be gain when we take time to share our view and while our communication should always deal with current issue of importance it must never stray far from our national commitment to battle against discrimination and increase our knowledge of each other

 a few isolated group in the backwater of american life still hold perverted notion of what america be all about recently in some place in the nation there be be a disturbing reoccurrence of bigotry and violence if i may from the platform of this organization know for its tolerance i would like to address a few remark to those group who still adhere to senseless racism and religious prejudice to those individual who persist in such hateful behavior

 if i be speak to they instead of to you i would say to they you be the one who be out of step with our society you be the one who willfully violate the meaning of the dream that be america and this country because of what it stand for will not stand for your conduct my administration will vigorously investigate and prosecute those who by violence or intimidation would attempt to deny americans their constitutional right

 another kind of terror have recently plague the city of atlanta not long ago in a speech before the congress i read the now famous pajama letter from peter sweeney if only my letter from child could all be as lighthearte as peter 's other letter be more poignant when little girl in atlanta write ask that i make thing right so they will not be scared anymore even a president of the united states can feel a little helpless

 we commit the resource of the fbi and a number of federal agency to help mayor jackson i appoint vice president bush to head this federal task force and its work will continue until this tragic episode be over not count manpower and equipment we have provide over $ 4 million to this cause i know that all of we wish we could tell the child of atlanta that they need no long fear and until we can say that however we will not be satisfied until those child can once again play safely in their school yard and park

 our dialog must also include discussion on how we can well protect the right and privilege of all our citizen my administration will root out any case of government discrimination against minority and uphold and enforce the law that protect they i emphasize that we will not retreat on the nation 's commitment to equal treatment of all citizen now that in my view be the primary responsibility of national government the attorney general be now carefully study the decennial redistricting plan be submit under the current voting rights act as soon as we have all the information there will be a decision regard extension of the act

 until a decision be announce you should know this i regard voting as the most sacred right of free man and woman we have not sacrifice and fight and toil to protect that right so that now we can sit back and permit a barrier to come between a secret ballot and any citizen who make a choice to cast it nothing nothing will change that as long as i be in a position to uphold the constitution of the united states

 in the month ahead our dialog also will include tough and realistic question about the role of the federal government in the black community i be not satisfied with its result and i do not think you be either and the failure of the past have be particularly hard on the minority poor because their hope have fail as surely as the federal program that build those hope but i must not be the only one who question about government policy

 can the black teenager who face a staggering unemployment rate feel that government policy be a success can the black wage earner who see more and more of his take home pay shrink because of government taxis feel satisfied can black parent say despite a massive influx of federal aid that educational standard in our school have improve appreciably can the woman i see on television recently whose family have be on welfare for three generation and who fear that her child might be the fourth can she believe that current government policy will save her child from such a fate

 we ask these tough question because we share your concern about the future of the black community we ask these question because the black of america should not be patronize as just one more voting bloc to be woo and win you be individual as we all be some have special need i do not think the federal government have meet those need

 i have be listen to the specific need of many people black farmer refugee union member woman small business man and woman and other group they're commonly refer to as special interest group well in reality they be all member of the interest group that i speak of the day i take the oath of office they be the people of america and i be pleased to serve that special interest group

 the people of the inner city will be represent by this administration every bit as much as the citizen of flagstaff arizona ithaca new york or dixon illinois where i grow up anyone who become president realize he must represent all the people of the land not just those of a home state or a particular party nor can he be just president of those who vote for he

 but it do not matter what group we belong to what area we live in how much or how little we earn the economy affect every single one of we regardless of our other interest and affiliation we have proceed full throttle on our economic recovery program because a strong grow economy without inflation be the sure most equitable way to ease the pressure on all the segment of our society

 the well being of black like the well being of every other american be link directly to the health of the economy for example industry in which black have make sufficient gain in employment substantial gain like auto and steel have be particularly hard hit and last hire first fire be a familiar refrain to too many black worker and i do not need to tell this group what inflation have do to those who can least afford it a decline economy be a poisonous gas that claim its first victim in poor neighborhood before float out into the community at large

 therefore in our national debate over budget and tax proposal we shall not concede the moral high ground to the proponent of those policy that be responsible in the first place for our economic mess a mess which have injure all americans we will not concede the moral high ground to those who show more concern for federal program than they do for what really determine the income and financial health of black the nation 's economy

 now i know you have be tell that my proposal for economic recovery be design to discriminate against all who be economically deprived now those who say that could be confuse by the misstatement that have be make by some who be either ignorant of the fact or those who be practice for political reason pure demagoguery

 rebuilding america 's economy be an absolute moral imperative if we be to avoid split this society in two with class against class i do not intend to let america drift far toward economic segregation we must change the economic direction of this country to bring more black into the mainstream and we must do it now

 and in 1938 before we have the equality we know today langston hughes write let america be america again and he write

 oh yes i see say it plain

 america never be america to i

 and yet i swear this oath

 america will be

 america will be that be the philosophy the people proclaim in last november 's election america will be and this time she will be for everyone together we can recreate for every citizen the same economic opportunity that we see lift up a land of immigrant people the kind of opportunity that have sweep the hungry and the persecute into the mainstream of our life since the american experiment begin

 to a number of black americans the u.s. economy have be something of an underground railroad it have spirit they away from poverty to middle class prosperity and beyond but too many black still remain behind a glance at the statistic will show that a large proportion of the black people have not find economic freedom nationwide for example 43 percent of black family in 1979 have money income under $ 10,000

 harriet tubman who be know as the conductor of that early underground railroad say on her first escape from slavery when i find i have cross that line i look at my hand to see if i be the same person there be such a glory over everything even after a century the beauty of her word be powerful we can only imagine the soaring of her soul what a feeling that must have be when she cross into freedom and the physical and mental shackle fall from her person

 harriet tubman 's glory be the glory of the american experience it be a glory which have no color or religious preference or nationality it be simply eloquently the universal thirst that all people have for freedom

 well there be poor people in this country who should experience just such an elation if they find the economic freedom of a solid job a productive job not one concoct by government and dependent on washington wind a real job where they could put in a good day 's work complain about the boss and then go home with confidence and self respect why have this nation be unable to fill such a basic admirable need

 the government can provide subsistence yes but it seldom move people up the economic ladder and as i have say before you have to get on the ladder before you can move up on it i believe many in washington over the year have be more dedicated to make needy people government dependent rather than independent they have create a new kind of bondage because regardless of how honest their intention in the beginning those they set out to help soon become client essential to the well being of those who administer the program

 an honest program would be dedicate to make people independent no long in need of government assistance but then what would happen to those who make a career of help well americans have be very generous with good intention and billion of dollar toward those they believe be live in hardship and yet in spite of the hope the government have never live up to the dream of poor people just as the emancipation proclamation free black people 118 year ago today we need to declare an economic emancipation

 i genuinely and deeply believe the economic package we have put forth will move we toward black economic freedom because it be aim at lift an entire country and not just part of it there be a truth to the word speak by john f. kennedy that a rise tide lift all boat yes i know it be be say what about the fellow without a boat who can not swim well i believe john kennedy 's figure of speech be refer to the benefit which accrue to all when the economy be flourish

 now much have be say and write not all of it flattering about the saving i have propose in the budget which be adopt by the house last friday i can assure you that the budget saving we have advocate be much more equitable than the tremendous cut in social program make by inflation and the decline economy which can not find job for almost 8 million man and woman who be unemployed

 those cut be exact without regard to need or age let i give some example in the prosperity of the 1960 's an era of only a few federal program cost very little the number of people live in poverty be reduce by nearly 50 percent during the stagflation of the 1970 's with many federal program with huge budget the number live in poverty be reduce by only 6 percent

 in the 1960 's black unemployment fall from 10.7 percent to 6.4 percent in the 1970 's it increase from 6.4 percent to 11.3 percent what be more relative to the white unemployment rate black unemployment fall more in the 1960 's but rise more in the 1970 's the decline economy have cut black family income from 1959 to 1969 the median family income of black after adjust for inflation rise at 5 percent per year but from 1969 to 1979 income actually drop

 now these be hard economic fact which be hard to take because they show massive amount of government aid and intervention have fail to produce the desire result a strong economy return the great good to the black population it return a benefit great than that provide by specific federal program by slow the growth of government and by limit the tax burden and thus stimulate investment we will also be reduce inflation and unemployment we will be create job nearly 3 million additional new job by 1986 we will be aid minority business which have be particularly hard hit by the scarcity of capital and the prohibitive interest rate and these concern be what the bipartisan tax cut proposal currently before the congress be all about

 i say the other day in our conversation in the oval office that the income a year or two ago i do not have the most recent figure for the black community be something like $ 140 billion now in most neighborhood what really bring prosperity be when the income of that neighborhood be then multiply by turn over several time within that community i must tell you that in the black community in america the turnover be less than once before the dollar those $ 140 billion go out into the community at large and that have to be change

 in the convention last summer benjamin hooks the one that i miss well no this be the republican convention i make that one benjamin hooks say to the assemble delegate we must decide as a nation if we be to become prisoner of our past or possessor of an enlightened and progressive future those be the very word i want to say to you today

 we can not be tie to the old way of solve our economic and racial problem but it be time we look to new answer and new way of thinking that will accomplish the very end the new deal and the great society anticipate we be not repeal the gain of black people we be solidify those gain and make they safe for your child and grandchild

 it be time that we find way to make the american economic pie big instead of just cut an ever small pie into more but small slice it be time we welcome those americans into the circle of prosperity to let they share in the wonder of our society and it be time to break the cycle of dependency that have become the legacy of so many federal program that no long work indeed some of which never do work

 let i give you an idea of how bountiful this famous economic pie could have be by now if productivity have not stop grow and then start downhill after 1965 the gross national product today would be $ 850 billion big enough to balance the budget cut personal and social security taxis in half and still provide every american with an extra $ 2,500 in spend money and all of this would have happen with the compliment of the private sector

 now you wisely learn to harness the federal government in the hard pull toward equality and that be right because guarantee equality of treatment be government 's proper function but as the last decade of statistic i just read indicate government be no long the strong draft horse of minority progress because it have attempt to do too many thing it be not equip to do i ask you if it be not time to hitch up a fresh horse to finish the task free enterprise be a powerful workhorse that can solve many problem of the black community that government alone can no long solve

 the black leadership of this nation have show tremendous courage both physical and intellectual and great creativity as it seek to bring equality to its people you in this audience be the inheritor of that proud black heritage you be the black leader of today and i believe you possess the very same courage and creativity i ask you to use that courage and creativity to examine the challenge that be face not just black but all of america

 i ask you to question the status quo as your predecessor do and look for new and imaginative way to overcome minority problem i be talk about the kind of courage and question your chairman margaret bush wilson show in take the heat for the naacp 's controversial 1978 energy statement a statement which shake the elitist of our country back into the real world at least for a time what i be ask you to consider require not so much a leap of faith but a realization that the federal government alone be just not capable of do the job we all want do for you or any other americans

 in the month ahead as the administration be free to turn attention from the economic program to other need of america we will be advance proposal on a number of issue of concern to this convention the inner city for example should be community neighborhood not warehouse of despair where child be bus out and ineffectual federal fund be bus in i believe that with the aid of commonsense government assistance and the use of free enterprise zone with less reliance on bus and more reliance on well basic education and with an emphasis on local activism such as you represent community can be reinvigorate

 certainly we be all inspire by the wonderful example of marva collins in chicago the gallant lady who have the educational grit to make shakespeare admirer out of inner city child she just prove to i what a friend of mine wilson riles california 's superintendent of education use to say the concept that black child can not learn unless they be sit among white child be utter and complete nonsense now dr. riles be not suggest that integration be not a good and proper thing it be and it be good for all of we when it be bring about with commonsense and attention to what be good for the child

 we plan to take a look a comprehensive look at the education of black from primary school upward and strengthen the base of black college which be a sound educational investment they be more than that they be a proud tradition a symbol of black determination and accomplishment and i feel deeply they must be preserve we have increase the share of department of education title iii fund spend on black college and that trend will continue

 we have equal concern for the black business leader of today minority business development as i indicate early be a key to black economic progress black own business be especially important in neighborhood economy where the dollar as i say spend have a beneficial multipli effect

 we want your input i expect my domestic adviser to be in regular touch with you as our policy evolve we may not always agree but new idea be often spark by opinion clash

 i do not come here today bear the promise of government handout which other have bring and which you have rightly learn to mistrust instead i ask you to join i to build a coalition for change

 seventy two year ago the famous call go forth the call for a conference emphasize the civil and political right of black and the result of that call of course be the national association for the advancement of colored people well today let we issue a call for new perspective on the economic challenge face black americans let we issue a call for exciting program to spring america forward toward the next century an america full of new solution to old problem

 we will link hand to build an era where we can put fear behind we and hope in front of we it can be an era in which program be less important than opportunity it can be an era where we all reach out in reconciliation instead of anger and dispute

 in the war in vietnam several year ago a live grenade fall among a group of american soldier they be freeze with horror know they be only second away from death then one young soldier a black throw himself on the grenade cover it with his helmet and his body he die to save his comrade great glory hath no man congressional medal of honor winner posthumously present garfield langhorn 's last whisper word be you have to care

 let we care let we work to build a nation that be free of racism full of opportunity and determine to loosen the creative energy of every person of every race of every station to make a well life it will be my honor to stand alongside you to answer this call

 thank you

i have intend to make some remark about the problem of social security tonight but the immediacy of congressional action on the tax program a key component of our economic package have to take priority let i just say however i have be deeply disturb by the way those of you who be dependent on social security have be needlessly frighten by some of the inaccuracy which have be give wide circulation it be true that the social security system have financial problem it be also true that these financial problem have be build for more than 20 year and nothing have be do i hope to address you on this entire subject in the near future

 in the meantime let i just say this i state during the campaign and i repeat now i will not stand by and see those of you who be dependent on social security deprive of the benefit you have work so hard to earn i make that pledge to you as your president you have no reason to be frightened you will continue to receive your check in the full amount due you in any plan to restore fiscal integrity of social security i personally will see that the plan will not be at the expense of you who be now dependent on your monthly social security check

 now let we turn to the business at hand it be be nearly 6 month since i first report to you on the state of the nation 's economy i be afraid my message that night be grim and disturbing i remember tell you we be in the bad economic mess since the great depression price be continue to spiral upward unemployment be reach intolerable level and all because government be too big and spend too much of our money

 we be still not out of the wood but we have make a start and we have certainly surprise those longtime and somewhat cynical observer of the washington scene who look listen and say it can never be do washington will never change its spending habit well something very exciting have be happen here in washington and you be responsible

 your voice have be hear million of you democrats republicans and independent from every profession trade and line of work and from every part of this land you send a message that you want a new beginning you want to change one little two little word two letter word i should say it do not sound like much but it sure can make a difference change by government control by government to control of government

 in that early broadcast you will recall i propose a program to drastically cut back government spending in the 1982 budget which begin october 1st and to continue cut in the 83 and 84 budget along with this i suggest an across the board tax cut spread over those same 3 year and the elimination of unnecessary regulation which be add billion to the cost of thing we buy

 all the lobbying the organized demonstration and the cry of protest by those whose way of life depend on maintain government 's wasteful way be no match for your voice which be hear loud and clear in these marble hall of government and you make history with your telegram your letter your phone call and yes personal visit to talk to your elect representative you reaffirm the mandate you deliver in the election last november a mandate that call for an end to government policy that send price and mortgage rate skyrocket while million of americans go jobless

 because of what you do republicans and democrats in the congress come together and pass the most sweeping cutback in the history of the federal budget right now member of the house and senate be meet in a conference committee to reconcile the difference between the two budget cut bill pass by the house and senate when they finish all americans will benefit from saving of approximately $ 140 billion in reduce government cost over just the next 3 year and that do not include the additional saving from the hundred of burdensome regulation already cancel or face cancellation

 for 19 out of the last 20 year the federal government have spend more than it take in there will be another large deficit in this present year which end september 30th but with our program in place it will not be quite as big as it might have be and start next year the deficit will get small until in just a few year the budget can be balance and we hope we can begin whittle at that almost $ 1 trillion debt that hang over the future of our child

 now so far i have be talk about only one part of our program for economic recovery the budget cut part i do not minimize its importance just the fact that democrats and republicans could work together as they have prove the strength of our system have create an optimism in our land the rate of inflation be no long in double digit figure the dollar have regain strength in the international money market and businessman and investor be make decision with regard to industrial development modernization and expansion all of this base on anticipation of our program be adopt and put into operation

 a recent poll show that where a year and a half ago only 24 percent of our people believe thing would get well today 46 percent believe they will to justify their faith we must deliver the other part of our program our economic package be a closely knit carefully construct plan to restore america 's economic strength and put our nation back on the road to prosperity

 each part of this package be vital it can not be consider piecemeal it be propose as a package and it have be support as such by the american people only if the congress pass all of its major component do it have any real chance of success this be absolutely essential if we be to provide incentive and make capital available for the increase productivity require to provide real permanent job for our people

 and let we not forget that the rest of the world be watch america carefully to see how we will act at this critical moment

 i have recently return from a summit meeting with world leader in ottawa canada and the message i hear from they be quite clear our ally depend on a strong and economically sound america and they be watch event in this country particularly those surround our program for economic recovery with close attention and great hope in short the good way to have a strong foreign policy abroad be to have a strong economy at home

 the day after tomorrow wednesday the house of representatives will begin debate on two tax bill and once again they need to hear from you i know that do not give you much time but a great deal be at stake a few day ago i be visit here in the office by a democratic congressman from one of our southern states he have be back in his district and one day one of his constituent ask he where he stand on our economic recovery program i outline that program in an early broadcast particularly the tax cut well the congressman who happen to be a strong leader in support of our program reply at some length with a discussion of the technical point involve but he also mention a few reservation he have on certain point the constituent a farmer listen politely until he have finish and then he say do not give i an essay what i want to know be be you for i m or agin i m

 well i appreciate the gentleman 's support and suggest his question be a message your own representative should hear let i add those representative honestly and sincerely want to know your feeling they get plenty of input from the special interest group they would like to hear from their home folk

 now let i explain what the situation be and what be at issue with our budget cut we have present a complete program of reduction in tax rate again our purpose be to provide incentive for the individual incentive for business to encourage production and hiring of the unemployed and to free up money for investment our bill call for a 5 percent reduction in the income tax rate by october 1st a 10 percent reduction begin july 1st 1982 and another 10 percent cut a year later a 25 percent total reduction over 3 year

 but then to ensure the tax cut be permanent we call for index the tax rate in 1985 which mean adjust they for inflation as it be now if you get a cost of living raise that be intend to keep you even with inflation you find that the increase in the number of dollar you get may very likely move you into a high tax bracket and you wind up poorer than you would this be call bracket creep

 bracket creep be an insidious tax let i give an example if you earn $ 10,000 a year in 1972 by 1980 you have to earn $ 19,700 just to stay even with inflation but that be before taxis come april 15th you will find your tax rate have increase 30 percent now if you have be wonder why you do not seem as well off as you be a few year back it be because government make a profit on inflation it get an automatic tax increase without have to vote on it we intend to stop that

 time will not allow i to explain every detail but our bill include just about everything to help the economy we reduce the marriage penalty that unfair tax that have a work husband and wife pay more tax than if they be single we increase the exemption on the inheritance or estate tax to $ 600,000 so that farmer and family own business do not have to sell the farm or store in the event of death just to pay the taxis most important we wipe out the tax entirely for a surviving spouse no long for example will a widow have to sell the family source of income to pay a tax on her husband 's death

 there be deduction to encourage investment and saving business get realistic depreciation on equipment and machinery and there be tax break for small and independent business which create 80 percent of all our new job

 this bill also provide major credit to the research and development industry these credit will help spark the high technology breakthrough that be so critical to america 's economic leadership in the world there be also add incentive for small business include a provision that will lift much of the burden of costly paperwork that government have impose on small business

 in addition there be short term but substantial assistance for the hard press thrift industry as well as reduction in oil taxis that will benefit new or independent oil producer and move our nation a step close to energy self sufficiency our bill be in short the first real tax cut for everyone in almost 20 year

 now when i first propose this incidentally it have now become a bipartisan measure coauthore by republican barber conable and democrat kent hance the democratic leadership say a tax cut be out of the question it would be wildly inflationary and that be before my inauguration and then your voice begin to he hear and suddenly in february the leadership discover that well a 1 year tax cut be feasible well we keep on push our 3 year tax cut and by june the opposition find that a 2 year tax cut might work now it be july and they find they could even go for a third year cut provide there be a trigger arrangement that would only allow it to go into effect if certain economic goal have be meet by 1983

 but by hold the people 's tax reduction hostage to future economic event they will eliminate the people 's ability to plan ahead shopkeeper farmer and individual will be deny the certainty they must have to begin save or invest more of their money and encourage more saving and investment be precisely what we need now to rebuild our economy

 there be also a little sleight of hand in that trigger mechanism you see their bill the committee bill ensure that the 1983 deficit will be $ 6 1/2 billion great than their own trigger require as it stand now the design of their own bill will not meet the trigger they have put in therefore the third year tax cut will automatically never take place

 if i could paraphrase a well know statement by will rogers that he have never meet a man he do not like i be afraid we have some people around here who never meet a tax they do not hike their tax proposal similar in a number of way to our but differ in some very vital part be pass out of the house ways and means committee and from now on i will refer to it as the committee bill and our as the bipartisan bill they will be the bill take up wednesday

 the majority leadership claim theirs give a great break to the worker than ours and it do that is if your're only plan to live 2 more year the plain truth be our choice be not between two plan to reduce taxis it be between a tax cut or a tax increase there be now build into our present system include payroll social security taxis and the bracket creep i have mention a 22 percent tax increase over the next 3 year the committee bill offer a 15 percent cut over 2 year our bipartisan bill give a 25 percent reduction over 3 year

 now as you can see by this chart there be the 22 percent tax increase their cut be below that line but our wipe out that increase and with a little to spare and there it be as you can see the red column that be the 15 percent tax cut and it still leave you with an increase the green column be our bipartisan bill which wipe out the tax increase and give you an ongoing cut

 incidentally their claim that cut taxis for individual for as much as 3 year ahead be risky ring a little hollow when you realize that their bill call for business tax cut each year for 7 year ahead it ring even more hollow when you consider the fact the majority leadership routinely endorse federal spending bill that project year into the future but object to a tax bill that will return your money over a 3 year period

 now here be another chart which illustrate what i say about their give a well break if you only intend to live for 2 more year their tax cut so call be the dotted line ours be the solid line as you can see in an earn bracket of $ 20,000 their tax cut be slightly more generous than our for the first 2 year then as you can see their tax bill the dotted line start go up and up and up on the other hand in our bipartisan tax bill the solid line our tax cut keep on go down and then stay down permanently this be true of all earn bracket not just the $ 20,000 level that i have use as an example from the low to the high this red space between the two line be the tax money that will remain in your pocket if our bill pass and it be the amount that will leave your pocket if their tax bill be pass

 now i take no pleasure in say this but those who will seek to defeat our conable hanee bipartisan bill as debate begin wednesday be the one who have give we five tax cut in the last 10 year but our taxis go up $ 400 billion in those same 10 year the line on these chart say a lot about who be really fight for whom on the one hand you see a genuine and lasting commitment to the future of work americans on the other just another empty promise

 those of we in the bipartisan coalition want to give this economy and the future of this nation back to the people because put people first have always be america 's secret weapon the house majority leadership seem less concerned about protect your family budget than with spend more on the federal budget

 our bipartisan tax bill target three quarter of its tax relief to middle income wage earner who presently pay almost three quarter of the total income tax it also then index the tax bracket to ensure that you can keep that tax reduction in the year ahead there also be as i say estate tax relief that will keep family farm and family own business in the family and there be provision for personal retirement plan and individual saving account

 because our bipartisan bill be so clearly draw and broadly base it provide the kind of predictability and certainty that the financial segment of our society need to make investment decision that stimulate productivity and make our economy grow even more important if the tax cut go to you the american people in the third year that money return to you will not be available to the congress to spend and that in my view be what this whole controversy come down to be you entitled to the fruit of your own labor or do government have some presumptive right to spend and spend and spend

 i be also convince our business tax cut be superior to theirs because it be more equitable and it will do a much well job promote the surge in investment we so badly need to rebuild our industrial base

 there be something else i want to tell you our bipartisan coalition work out a tax bill we feel would provide incentive and stimulate productivity thus reduce inflation and provide job for the unemployed that be our only goal our opponent in the beginning do not want a tax bill at all so what be the purpose behind their change of heart they have put a tax program together for one reason only to provide themselves with a political victory never mind that it will not solve the economic problem confront our country never mind that it will not get the wheel of industry turn again or eliminate the inflation which be eat we alive

 this be not the time for political fun and game this be the time for a new beginning i ask you now to put aside any feeling of frustration or helplessness about our political institution and join i in this dramatic but responsible plan to reduce the enormous burden of federal taxation on you and your family

 during recent month many of you have ask what can you do to help make america strong again i urge you again to contact your senators and congressman tell they of your support for this bipartisan proposal tell they you believe this be an unequalled opportunity to help return america to prosperity and make government again the servant of the people

 in a few day the congress will stand at the fork of two road one road be all too familiar to we it lead ultimately to high taxis it merely bring we full circle back to the source of our economic problem where the government decide that it know well than you what should be do with your earning and in fact how you should conduct your life the other road promise to renew the american spirit it be a road of hope and opportunity it place the direction of your life back in your hand where it belong

 i have not take your time this evening merely to ask you to trust i instead i ask you to trust yourself that be what america be all about our struggle for nationhood our unrelenting fight for freedom our very existence these have all rest on the assurance that you must be free to shape your life as you be well able to that no one can stop you from reach higher or take from you the creativity that have make america the envy of mankind

 one road be timid and fearful the other bold and hopeful

 in these 6 month we have do so much and have come so far it be be the power of million of people like you who have determine that we will make america great again you have make the difference up to now you will make the difference again let we not stop now

 thank you god bless you and good night







the president this morning at 7 a.m. the union represent those who man america 's air traffic control facility call a strike this be the culmination of 7 month of negotiation between the federal aviation administration and the union at one point in these negotiation agreement be reach and sign by both side grant a $ 40 million increase in salary and benefit this be twice what other government employee can expect it be grant in recognition of the difficulty inherent in the work these people perform now however the union demand be 17 time what have be agree to—$681 million this would impose a tax burden on their fellow citizen which be unacceptable

 i would like to thank the supervisor and controller who be on the job today help to get the nation 's air system operate safely in the new york area for example four supervisor be schedule to report for work and 17 additionally volunteer at national airport a traffic controller tell a newsperson he have resign from the union and report to work because how can i ask my kid to obey the law if i do not this be a great tribute to america

 let i make one thing plain i respect the right of worker in the private sector to strike indeed as president of my own union i lead the first strike ever call by that union i guess i be maybe the first one to ever hold this office who be a lifetime member of an afl cio union but we can not compare labor management relation in the private sector with government government can not close down the assembly line it have to provide without interruption the protective service which be government 's reason for be

 it be in recognition of this that the congress pass a law forbid strike by government employee against the public safety let i read the solemn oath take by each of these employee a sworn affidavit when they accept their job i be not participate in any strike against the government of the united states or any agency thereof and i will not so participate while an employee of the government of the united states or any agency thereof

 it be for this reason that i must tell those who fail to report for duty this morning they be in violation of the law and if they do not report for work within 48 hour they have forfeit their job and will be terminate

 q. mr. president be you go to order any union member who violate the law to go to jail

 the president well i have some people around here and maybe i should refer that question to the attorney general

 q. do you think that they should go to jail mr. president anybody who violate this law

 the president i tell you what i think should be do they be terminate

 the attorney general well as the president have say strike under these circumstance constitute a violation of the law and we intend to initiate in appropriate case criminal proceeding against those who have violate the law

 q. how quickly will you initiate criminal proceeding mr. attorney general

 the attorney general we will initiate those proceeding as soon as we can

 q. today

 the attorney general the process will be underway probably by noon today

 q. be you go to try and fine the union $ 1 million per day

 the attorney general well that be the prerogative of the court in the event that any individual be find guilty of contempt of a court order the penalty for that of course be impose by the court

 q. how much more be the government prepare to offer the union

 the secretary of transportation we think we have a very satisfactory offer on the table it be twice what other government employee be go to get-11.4 percent their demand be so unreasonable there be no spot to negotiate when you be talk to somebody 17 time away from where you presently be we do not plan to increase our offer to the union

 q. under no circumstance

 the secretary of transportation as far as i be concern under no circumstance

 q. will you continue to meet with they the secretary of transportation we will not meet with the union as long as they be on strike when they be off of strike and assume that they be not decertifie we will meet with the union and try to negotiate a satisfactory contract

 q. do you have any idea how it be go at the airport around the country

 the secretary of transportation relatively it be go quite well we be operate somewhat in excess of 50 percent capacity we could increase that we have determine until we feel we be in total control of the system that we will not increase that also as you probably know we have some rather severe weather in the midwest and our first priority be safety

 q. what can you tell we about possible decertification of the union and impoundment of its strike fund

 the secretary of transportation there have be a court action to impound the strike fund of $ 3.5 million we be go before the national labor relations authority this morning and ask for decertification of the union

 q. when you say that you be not go to increase your offer be you refer to the original offer or the last offer which you have make be that still valid

 the secretary of transportation the last offer we make in present value be exactly the same as the first offer mr. poli ask i about 11 o'clock last evening if he could phase the increase in over a period of time for that reason we phase it in over a long period of time it would have give he a large increase in term of where he would be when the next negotiation start but in present value it be the $ 40 million originally on the table

 q. mr. attorney general in seek criminal action against the union leader will you seek to put they in jail if they do not order these people back to work

 the attorney general well we will seek whatever penalty be appropriate under the circumstance in each individual case

 q. do you think that be an appropriate circumstance

 the attorney general it be certainly one of the penalty that be provide for in the law and in appropriate case we could very well seek that penalty

 q. what be appropriate

 the attorney general well that depend upon the fact of each case

 q. what make the difference

 q. can i go back to my fine question how much would you like to see the union fine every day

 the attorney general well there be no way to answer that question we would just have to wait until we get into court see what the circumstance be and determine what position we would take in the various case under the fact as they develop

 q. but you will not go to court and ask the court for a specific amount

 the attorney general well i be sure we will when we reach that point but there be no way to pick a figure now

 q. mr. president will you delay your trip to california or cancel it if the strike be still on later this week

 the president if any situation should arise that would require my presence here naturally i will do that so that will be a decision that await what be go to happen may i just because i have to be back in there for another appointment may i just say one thing on top of this with all this talk of penalty and everything else i hope that you will emphasize again the possibility of termination because i believe that there be a great many of those people and they be fine people who have be sweep up in this and probably have not really consider the result the fact that they have take an oath the fact that this be now in violation of the law as that one supervisor refer to with regard to his child and i be hope that they will in a sense remove themselves from the lawbreaker situation by return to their post

 i have no way to know whether this have be convey to they by their union leader who have be inform that this would be the result of a strike

 q. your deadline be 7 o'clock wednesday morning for they to return to work

 the president forty eight hour

 the secretary of transportation it be 11 o'clock wednesday morning

 q. mr. president why have you take such strong action as your first action why not some less action at this point

 the president what less action can there be the law be very explicit they be violate the law and as i say we call this to the attention of their leadership whether this be convey to the membership before they vote to strike i do not know but this be one of the reason why there can be no further negotiation while this situation continue you can not sit and negotiate with a union that be in violation of the law

 the secretary of transportation and their oath

 the president and their oath

 q. be you more likely to proceed in the criminal direction toward the leadership than the rank and file mr. president

 the president well that again be not for i to answer

 q. mr. secretary what can you tell we about the possible use of military air controller how many how quickly can they get on the job

 the secretary of transportation in answer to the previous question we will move both civil and criminal probably more civil than criminal and we now have paper in the u.s. attorney office under the attorney general in about 20 location around the country where would be involve two or three principal people

 as far as the military personnel be concern they be go to fundamentally be backup to the supervisory personnel we have 150 on the job supposedly about a half hour ago we be go to increase that to somewhere between 700 and 850

 q. mr. secretary be you ready to hire other people should these other people not return

 the secretary of transportation yes we will and we hope we do not reach that point again as the president say we be hope these people come back to work they do a fine job if that do not take place we have a training school as you know we will be advertise we have a number of applicant right now there be a waiting list in term of people that want to be controller and we will start retrain and reorganize the entire faa traffic controller group

 q. just to clarify be your deadline 7 a.m. wednesday or 11 o'clock

 the secretary of transportation it be 11 a.m. wednesday the president say 48 hour and that would be 48 hour

 q. if you actually fire these people will not it put your air traffic control system in a hole for year to come since you can not just cook up a controller in-[inaudible

 the secretary of transportation that obviously depend on how many return to work right now we be able to operate the system in some area we have be very gratified by the support we have receive in other area we have be disappoint and until i see the number there be no way i can answer that question

 q. mr. lewis do you tell the union leadership when you be talk to they that their member would be fire if they go out on strike

 the secretary of transportation i tell mr. poll yesterday that the president give i three instruction in term of the firmness of the negotiation one be there would be no amnesty the second there would be no negotiation during the strike and third be that if they go on strike these people would no long be government employee

 the attorney general in the civil action that be file this morning the service be make on the attorney for the union and the court have determine that that be appropriate service on all of the officer of the union

 q. my previous question about whether you be go to take a hard line on the leadership than rank and file in term of any criminal prosecution can you give we an answer on that

 the secretary of transportation for year if we have to

 the secretary of transportation it vary it depend on the type of center they be go to be in for someone to start in the system and work through the more minor office type of control situation till they get to let us say a chicago or a washington national it take about 3 year so in this case what we will have to do if some of the major metropolitan area be shut down or a considerable portion be shut down we will be bring people in from other area that be qualified and then start bring people through the training school in the small city and small airport

 q. mr. secretary have you definitely make your final offer to the union

 the secretary of transportation yes we have

 q. thank you

officer lady and gentleman of the national press club and as of a very short time ago fellow member


  back in april while in the hospital i have as you can readily understand a lot of time for reflection and one day i decide to send a personal handwritten letter to soviet president leonid brezhnev remind he that we have meet about 10 year ago in san clemente california as he and president nixon be conclude a series of meeting that have bring hope to all the world never have peace and good will seem close at hand


  i would like to read you a few paragraph from that letter mr. president when we meet i ask if you be aware that the hope and aspiration of million of people throughout the world be dependent on the decision that would be reach in those meeting you take my hand in both of yours and assure i that you be aware of that and that you be dedicate with all your heart and soul and mind to fulfil those hope and dream


  i go on in my letter to say the people of the world still share that hope indeed the people of the world despite difference in racial and ethnic origin have very much in common they want the dignity of have some control over their individual life their destiny they want to work at the craft or trade of their own choosing and to be fairly reward they want to raise their family in peace without harm anyone or suffer harm themselves government exist for their convenience not the other way around


  if they be incapable as some would have we believe of self government then where among they do we find any who be capable of govern other


  be it possible that we have permit ideology political and economic philosophy and governmental policy to keep we from consider the very real everyday problem of our people will the average soviet family be well off or even aware that the soviet union have impose a government of its own choice on the people of afghanistan be life well for the people of cuba because the cuban military dictate who shall govern the people of angola


  it be often imply that such thing have be make necessary because of territorial ambition of the united states that we have imperialistic design and thus constitute a threat to your own security and that of the newly emerge nation not only be there no evidence to support such a charge there be solid evidence that the united states when it could have dominate the world with no risk to itself make no effort whatsoever to do so


  when world war ii end the united states have the only undamaged industrial power in the world our military might be at its peak and we alone have the ultimate weapon the nuclear weapon with the unquestione ability to deliver it anywhere in the world if we have seek world domination then who could have oppose we


  but the united states follow a different course one unique in all the history of mankind we use our power and wealth to rebuild the war ravish economy of the world include those of the nation who have be our enemy may i say there be absolutely no substance to charge that the united states be guilty of imperialism or attempt to impose its will on other country by use of force


  i continue my letter by say or conclude my letter i should say by say mr. president should we not be concern with eliminate the obstacle which prevent our people those you and i represent from achieve their most cherished goal


  well it be in the same spirit that i want to speak today to this audience and the people of the world about america 's program for peace and the come negotiation which begin november 30th in geneva switzerland specifically i want to present our program for preserve peace in europe and our wide program for arm control


  twice in my lifetime i have see the people of europe plunge into the tragedy of war twice in my lifetime europe have suffer destruction and military occupation in war that statesman prove powerless to prevent soldier unable to contain and ordinary citizen unable to escape and twice in my lifetime young americans have bleed their life into the soil of those battlefield not to enrich or enlarge our domain but to restore the peace and independence of our friend and allies


  all of we who live through those trouble time share a common resolve that they must never come again and most of we share a common appreciation of the atlantic alliance that have make a peaceful free and prosperous western europe in the post war era possible


  but today a new generation be emerge on both side of the atlantic its member be not present at the creation of the north atlantic alliance many of they do not fully understand its root in defend freedom and rebuild a war tear continent some young people question why we need weapon particularly nuclear weapon to deter war and to assure peaceful development they fear that the accumulation of weapon itself may lead to conflagration some even propose unilateral disarmament


  i understand their concern their question deserve to be answer but we have an obligation to answer their question on the basis of judgment and reason and experience our policy have result in the long european peace in this century would not a rash departure from these policy as some now suggest endanger that peace


  from its founding the atlantic alliance have preserve the peace through unity deterrence and dialog first we and our allies have stand unite by the firm commitment that an attack upon any one of we would be consider an attack upon we all second we and our allies have deter aggression by maintain force strong enough to ensure that any aggressor would lose more from an attack than he could possibly gain and third we and our allies have engage the soviets in a dialog about mutual restraint and arm limitation hope to reduce the risk of war and the burden of armament and to lower the barrier that divide east from west


  these three element of our policy have preserve the peace in europe for more than a third of a century they can preserve it for generation to come so long as we pursue they with sufficient will and vigor


  today i wish to reaffirm america 's commitment to the atlantic alliance and our resolve to sustain the peace and from my conversation with allied leader i know that they also remain true to this try and prove course


  nato ’s policy of peace be base on restraint and balance no nato weapon conventional or nuclear will ever be use in europe except in response to attack nato ’s defense plan have be responsible and restrained the allies remain strong united and resolute but the momentum of the continue soviet military buildup threaten both the conventional and the nuclear balance


  consider the fact over the past decade the united states reduce the size of its armed forces and decrease its military spending the soviets steadily increase the number of man under arm they now number more than double those of the united states over the same period the soviets expand their real military spending by about one third the soviet union increase its inventory of tank to some 50,000 compare to our 11,000 historically a land power they transform their navy from a coastal defense force to an open ocean fleet while the united states a sea power with transoceanic alliance cut its fleet in half


  during a period when nato deploy no new intermediate range nuclear missile and actually withdraw 1,000 nuclear warhead the soviet union deploy more than 750 nuclear warhead on the new ss20 missile alone


  our response to this relentless buildup of soviet military power have be restrain but firm we have make decision to strengthen all three leg of the strategic triad sea- land- and air base we have propose a defense program in the united states for the next 5 year which will remedy the neglect of the past decade and restore the erode balance on which our security depend


  i would like to discuss more specifically the grow threat to western europe which be pose by the continue deployment of certain soviet intermediate range nuclear missile the soviet union have three different type such missile system the ss20 the ss-4 and the ss-5 all with the range capable of reach virtually all of western europe there be other soviet weapon system which also represent a major threat


  now the only answer to these system be a comparable threat to soviet threat to soviet target in other word a deterrent prevent the use of these soviet weapon by the counterthreat of a like response against their own territory at present however there be no equivalent deterrent to these soviet intermediate missile and the soviets continue to add one new ss-20 a week


  to counter this the allies agree in 1979 as part of a two track decision to deploy as a deterrent land base cruise missile and pershing ii missile capable of reach target in the soviet union these missile be to be deploy in several country of western europe this relatively limited force in no way serve as a substitute for the much large strategic umbrella spread over our nato allies rather it provide a vital link between conventional short range nuclear force in europe and intercontinental force in the united states


  deployment of these system will demonstrate to the soviet union that this link can not be break deter war depend on the perceive ability of our force to perform effectively the more effective our force be the less likely it be that we will have to use they so we and our ally be proceed to modernize nato 's nuclear force of intermediate range to meet increase soviet deployment of nuclear system threaten western europe


  let i turn now to our hope for arm control negotiation there ’ a tendency to make this entire subject overly complex i want to be clear and concise i tell you of the letter i write to president brezhnev last april well i have just send another message to the soviet leadership it ’ a simple straightforward yet historic message the united states propose the mutual reduction of conventional intermediate range nuclear and strategic force specifically i have propose a four point agenda to achieve this objective in my letter to president brezhnev


  the first and most important point concern the geneva negotiation as part of the 1979 two track decision nato make a commitment to seek arm control negotiation with the soviet union on intermediate range nuclear force the united states have be prepare for these negotiation through close consultation with our nato partner


  we be now ready to set forth our proposal i have inform president brezhnev that when our delegation travel to the negotiation on intermediate range land base nuclear missile in geneva on the 30th of this month my representative will present the follow proposal the united states be prepared to cancel its deployment of pershing ii and ground launch cruise missile if the soviets will dismantle their ss-20 ss-4 and ss-5 missile this would be an historic step with soviet agreement we could together substantially reduce the dread threat of nuclear war which hang over the people of europe this like the first footstep on the moon would be a giant step for mankind


  now we intend to negotiate in good faith and go to geneva willing to listen to and consider the proposal of our soviet counterpart but let i call to your attention the background against which our proposal be make


  during the past 6 year while the united states deploy no new intermediate range missile and withdraw 1,000 nuclear warhead from europe the soviet union deploy 750 warhead on mobile accurate ballistic missile they now have 1,100 warhead on the ss-20s ss-4s and 5s and the united states have no comparable missile indeed the united states dismantle the last such missile in europe over 15 year ago


  as we look to the future of the negotiation it be also important to address certain soviet claim which leave unrefuted could become critical barrier to real progress in arm control


  the soviets assert that a balance of intermediate range nuclear force already exist that assertion be wrong by any objective measure as this chart indicate the soviet union have develop an increasingly overwhelming advantage they now enjoy a superiority on the order of six to one the red be the soviet buildup the blue be our own that be 1975 and that be 1981


  now soviet spokesman have suggest that move their ss-20s behind the ural mountains will remove the threat to europe well as this map demonstrate the ss-20s even if deploy behind the urals will have a range that put almost all of western europe the great city rome athens paris london brussels amsterdam berlin and so many more all of scandinavia all of the middle east all of northern africa all within range of these missile which incidentally be mobile and can be move on short notice these little image mark the present location which would give they a range clear out into the atlantic


  the second proposal that i have make to president brezhnev concern strategic weapon the united states propose to open negotiation on strategic arm as soon as possible next year


  i have instruct secretary haig to discuss the timing of such meeting with soviet representative substance however be far more important than timing as our proposal for the geneva talk this month illustrate we can make proposal for genuinely serious reduction but only if we take the time to prepare carefully


  the united states have be prepare carefully for resumption of strategic arm negotiation because we do not want a repetition of past disappointment we do not want an arm control process that send hope soar only to end in dash expectation


  now i have inform president brezhnev that we will seek to negotiate substantial reduction in nuclear arm which would result in level that be equal and verifiable our approach to verification will be to emphasize openness and creativity rather than the secrecy and suspicion which have undermine confidence in arm control in the past


  while we can hope to benefit from work do over the past decade in strategic arm negotiation let we agree to do more than simply begin where these previous effort leave off we can and should attempt major qualitative and quantitative progress only such progress can fulfill the hope of our own people and the rest of the world and let we see how far we can go in achieve truly substantial reduction in our strategic arsenal


  to symbolize this fundamental change in direction we will call these negotiation stabt strategic arms reduction talks


  the third proposal i have make to the soviet union be that we act to achieve equality at low level of conventional force in europe the defense need of the soviet union hardly call for maintain more combat division in east germany today than be in the whole allied invasion force that land in normandy on d day the soviet union could make no more convincing contribution to peace in europe and in the world than by agree to reduce its conventional force significantly and constrain the potential for sudden aggression


  finally i have point out to president brezhnev that to maintain peace we must reduce the risk of surprise attack and the chance of war arise out of uncertainty or miscalculation


  i be renew our proposal for a conference to develop effective measure that would reduce these danger at the current madrid meeting of the conference on security and cooperation in europe we be lay the foundation for a western propose conference on disarmament in europe this conference would discuss new measure to enhance stability and security in europe agreement in this conference be within reach i urge the soviet union to join we and many other nation who be ready to launch this important enterprise


  all of these proposal be base on the same fair minded principle substantial militarily significant reduction in force equal ceiling for similar type of force and adequate provision for verification


  my administration our country and i be commit to achieve arm reduction agreement base on these principle today i have outline the kind of bold equitable proposal which the world expect of we but we can not reduce arm unilaterally success can only come if the soviet union will share our commitment if it will demonstrate that its often repeat profession of concern for peace will be match by positive action


  preservation of peace in europe and the pursuit of arm reduction talk be of fundamental importance but we must also help to bring peace and security to region now tear by conflict external intervention and war


  the american concept of peace go well beyond the absence of war we foresee a flowering of economic growth and individual liberty in a world at peace


  at the economic summit conference in cancun i meet with the leader of 21 nation and sketch out our approach to global economic growth we want to eliminate the barrier to trade and investment which hinder these critical incentive to growth and we be work to develop new program to help the poor nation achieve self sustain growth


  and term like peace and security we have to say have little meaning for the oppressed and the destitute they also mean little to the individual whose state have strip he of human freedom and dignity wherever there be oppression we must strive for the peace and security of individual as well as state we must recognize that progress and the pursuit of liberty be a necessary complement to military security nowhere have this fundamental truth be more boldly and clearly state than in the helsinki accords of 1975 these accord have not yet be translate into live reality


  today i have announce an agenda that can help to achieve peace security and freedom across the globe in particular i have make an important offer to forego entirely deployment of new american missile in europe if the soviet union be prepared to respond on an equal footing


  there be no reason why people in any part of the world should have to live in permanent fear of war or its spectre i believe the time have come for all nation to act in a responsible spirit that do not threaten other state i believe the time be right to move forward on arm control and the resolution of critical regional dispute at the conference table nothing will have a high priority for i and for the american people over the come month and year


  address the united nations 20 year ago another american president describe the goal that we still pursue today he say if we all can persevere if we can look beyond our shore and ambition then surely the age will dawn in which the strong be just and the weak secure and the peace preserve


  he do not live to see that goal achieve i invite all nation to join with america today in the quest for such a world


  thank you

good evening

 at christmas time every home take on a special beauty a special warmth and that be certainly true of the white house where so many famous americans have spend their christmas over the year this fine old home the people 's house have see so much be so much a part of all our life and history it be be humble and inspire for nancy and i to be spend our first christmas in this place

 we have live here as your tenant for almost a year now and what a year it be be as a people we have be through quite a lot moment of joy of tragedy and of real achievement moment that i believe have bring we all close together g.k. chesterton once say that the world would never starve for wonder but only for the want of wonder

 at this special time of year we all renew our sense of wonder in recall the story of the first christmas in bethlehem nearly 2,000 year ago

 some celebrate christmas as the birthday of a great and good philosopher and teacher other of we believe in the divinity of the child bear in bethlehem that he be and be the promise prince of peace yes we have question why he who could perform miracle choose to come among we as a helpless babe but maybe that be his first miracle his first great lesson that we should learn to care for one another

 tonight in million of american home the glow of the christmas tree be a reflection of the love jesus teach we like the shepherd and wise man of that first christmas we americans have always try to follow a high light a star if you will at lonely campfire vigil along the frontier in the dark day of the great depression through war and peace the twin beacon of faith and freedom have brighten the american sky at time our footstep may have falter but trust in god 's help we have never lose our way

 just across the way from the white house stand the two great emblem of the holiday season a menorah symbolize the jewish festival of hanukkah and the national christmas tree a beautiful tower blue spruce from pennsylvania like the national christmas tree our country be a living grow thing plant in rich american soil only our devoted care can bring it to full flower so let this holiday season be for we a time of rededication

 even as we rejoice however let we remember that for some americans this will not be as happy a christmas as it should be i know a little of what they feel i remember one christmas eve during the great depression my father open what he think be a christmas greeting it be a notice that he no long have a job

 over the past year we have begin the long hard work of economic recovery our goal be an america in which every citizen who need and want a job can get a job our program for recovery have only be in place for 12 week now but it be begin to work with your help and prayer it will succeed we be win the battle against inflation runaway government spending and taxation and that victory will mean more economic growth more job and more opportunity for all americans

 a few month before he take up residence in this house one of my predecessor john kennedy try to sum up the temper of the time with a quote from an author closely tie to christmas charles dickens we be live he say in the good of time and the bad of time well in some way that be even more true today the world be full of peril as well as promise too many of its people even now live in the shadow of want and tyranny

 as i speak to you tonight the fate of a proud and ancient nation hang in the balance for a thousand year christmas have be celebrate in poland a land of deep religious faith but this christmas bring little joy to the courageous polish people they have be betray by their own government

 the man who rule they and their totalitarian ally fear the very freedom that the polish people cherish they have answer the stirring of liberty with brute force killing mass arrest and the setting up of concentration camp lech walesa and other solidarity leader be imprison their fate unknown factory mine university and home have be assault

 the polish government have trample underfoot solemn commitment to the un charter and the helsinki accord it have even break the gdansk agreement of august 1980 by which the polish government recognize the basic right of its people to form free trade union and to strike

 the tragic event now occur in poland almost two year to the day after the soviet invasion of afghanistan have be precipitate by public and secret pressure from the soviet union it be no coincidence that soviet marshal kulikov chief of the warsaw pact force and other senior red army officer be in poland while these outrage be be initiate and it be no coincidence that the martial law proclamation impose in december by the polish government be be print in the soviet union in september

 the target of this depression repression be the solidarity movement but in attack solidarity its enemy attack an entire people ten million of poland 's 36 million citizen be member of solidarity take together with their family they account for the overwhelming majority of the polish nation by persecute solidarity the polish government wage war against its own people

 i urge the polish government and its ally to consider the consequence of their action how can they possibly justify use naked force to crush a people who ask for nothing more than the right to lead their own life in freedom and dignity brute force may intimidate but it can not form the basis of an endure society and the ail polish economy can not be rebuild with terror tactic

 poland need cooperation between its government and its people not military oppression if the polish government will honor the commitment it have make to human right in document like the gdansk agreement we in america will gladly do our share to help the shattered polish economy just as we help the country of europe after both world wars

 it be ironic that we offer and poland express interest in accept our help after world war ii the soviet union intervene then and refuse to allow such help to poland but if the force of tyranny in poland and those who incite they from without do not relent they should prepare themselves for serious consequence already throughout the free world citizen have publicly demonstrate their support for the polish people our government and those of our ally have express moral revulsion at the police state tactic of poland 's oppressor the church have also speak out in spite of threat and intimidation but our reaction can not stop there

 i want emphatically to state tonight that if the outrage in poland do not cease we can not and will not conduct business as usual with the perpetrator and those who aid and abet they make no mistake their crime will cost they dearly in their future dealing with america and free people everywhere i do not make this statement lightly or without serious reflection

 we have be measure and deliberate in our reaction to the tragic event in poland we have not act in haste and the step i will outline tonight and other we may take in the day ahead be firm just and reasonable

 in order to aid the suffer polish people during this critical period we will continue the shipment of food through private humanitarian channel but only so long as we know that the polish people themselves receive the food the neighboring country of austria have open her door to refugee from poland i have therefore direct that american assistance include supply of basic foodstuff be offer to aid the austrians in provide for these refugee

 but to underscore our fundamental opposition to the repressive action take by the polish government against its own people the administration have suspend all government sponsor shipment of agricultural and dairy product to the polish government this suspension will remain in force until absolute assurance be receive that distribution of these product be monitor and guarantee by independent agency we must be sure that every bit of food provide by america go to the polish people not to their oppressor

 the united states be take immediate action to suspend major element of our economic relationship with the polish government we have halt the renewal of the export import bank 's line of export credit insurance to the polish government we will suspend polish civil aviation privilege in the united states we be suspend the right of poland 's fishing fleet to operate in american water and we be propose to our ally the further restriction of high technology export to poland

 these action be not direct against the polish people they be a warning to the government of poland that free man can not and will not stand idly by in the face of brutal repression to underscore this point i have write a letter to general jaruzelski head of the polish government in it i outline the step we be take and warn of the serious consequence if the polish government continue to use violence against its populace i have urge he to free those in arbitrary detention to lift martial law and to restore the internationally recognize right of the polish people to free speech and association

 the soviet union through its threat and pressure deserve a major share of blame for the development in poland so i have also send a letter to president brezhnev urge he to permit the restoration of basic human right in poland provide for in the helsinki final act in it i inform he that if this repression continue the united states will have no choice but to take further concrete political and economic measure affect our relationship

 when 19th century polish patriot rise against foreign oppressor their rallying cry be for our freedom and your well that motto still ring true in our time there be a spirit of solidarity abroad in the world tonight that no physical force can crush it cross national boundary and enter into the heart of man and woman everywhere in factory farm and school in city and town around the globe we the people of the free world stand as one with our polish brother and sister their cause be ours and our prayer and hope go out to they this christmas

 yesterday i meet in this very room with romuald spasowski the distinguished former polish ambassador who have seek asylum in our country in protest of the suppression of his native land he tell i that one of the way the polish people have demonstrate their solidarity in the face of martial law be by place light candle in their window to show that the light of liberty still glow in their heart

 ambassador spasowski request that on christmas eve a light candle will burn in the white house window as a small but certain beacon of our solidarity with the polish people i urge all of you to do the same tomorrow night on christmas eve as a personal statement of your commitment to the step we be take to support the brave people of poland in their time of trouble

 once early in this century an evil influence threaten that the light be go out all over the world let the light of million of candle in american home give notice that the light of freedom be not go to be extinguish we be bless with a freedom and abundance deny to so many let those candle remind we that these blessing bring with they a solid obligation an obligation to the god who guide we an obligation to the heritage of liberty and dignity hand down to we by our forefather and an obligation to the child of the world whose future will be shape by the way we live our life today

 christmas mean so much because of one special child but christmas also remind we that all child be special that they be gift from god gift beyond price that mean more than any present money can buy in their love and laughter in our hope for their future lie the true meaning of christmas

 so in a spirit of gratitude for what we have be able to achieve together over the past year and look forward to all that we hope to achieve together in the year ahead nancy and i want to wish you all the good of holiday season as charles dickens whom i quote a few moment ago say so well in a christmas carol god bless we every one

 good night



mr. speaker mr. president distinguished members of the congress honored guest and fellow citizen

 today mark my first state of the union address to you a constitutional duty as old as our republic itself

 president washington begin this tradition in 1790 after remind the nation that the destiny of self government and the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty be finally stake on the experiment entrust to the hand of the american people for our friend in the press who place a high premium on accuracy let i say i do not actually hear george washington say that laughter but it be a matter of historic record laughter

 but from this podium winston churchill ask the free world to stand together against the onslaught of aggression franklin delano roosevelt speak of a day of infamy and summon a nation to arm douglas macarthur make an unforgettable farewell to a country he love and serve so well dwight eisenhower remind we that peace be purchase only at the price of strength and john f. kennedy speak of the burden and glory that be freedom

 when i visit this chamber last year as a newcomer to washington critical of past policy which i believe have fail i propose a new spirit of partnership between this congress and this administration and between washington and our state and local government in forge this new partnership for america we could achieve the old hope of our republic prosperity for our nation peace for the world and the blessing of individual liberty for our child and someday for all of humanity

 it be my duty to report to you tonight on the progress that we have make in our relation with other nation on the foundation we have carefully lay for our economic recovery and finally on a bold and spirited initiative that i believe can change the face of american government and make it again the servant of the people

 seldom have the stake be high for america what we do and say here will make all the difference to autoworker in detroit lumberjack in the northwest steelworker in steubenville who be in the unemployment line to black teenager in newark and chicago to hard press farmer and small businessman and to million of everyday americans who harbor the simple wish of a safe and financially secure future for their child to understand the state of the union we must look not only at where we be and where we be go but where we have be the situation at this time last year be truly ominous

 the last decade have see a series of recession there be a recession in 1970 in 1974 and again in the spring of 1980 each time unemployment increase and inflation soon turn up again we coin the word stagflation to describe this

 government 's response to these recession be to pump up the money supply and increase spending in the last 6 month of 1980 as an example the money supply increase at the fast rate in postwar history—13 percent inflation remain in double digit and government spending increase at an annual rate of 17 percent interest rate reach a staggering 21.5 percent there be 8 million unemployed

 late in 1981 we sink into the present recession largely because continue high interest rate hurt the auto industry and construction and there be a drop in productivity and the already high unemployment increase

 this time however thing be different we have an economic program in place completely different from the artificial quick fix of the past it call for a reduction of the rate of increase in government spending and already that rate have be cut nearly in half but reduce spend the first and small phase of a 3 year tax rate reduction design to stimulate the economy and create job already interest rate be down to 15 3/4 percent but they must still go low inflation be down from 12.4 percent to 8.9 and for the month of december it be run at an annualize rate of 5.2 percent if we have not act as we do thing would be far bad for all americans than they be today inflation taxis and interest rate would all be high

 a year ago americans faith in their governmental process be steadily decline six out of 10 americans be say they be pessimistic about their future a new kind of defeatism be hear some say our domestic problem be uncontrollable that we have to learn to live with this seemingly endless cycle of high inflation and high unemployment

 there be also pessimistic prediction about the relationship between our administration and this congress it be say we could never work together well those prediction be wrong the record be clear and i believe that history will remember this as an era of american renewal remember this administration as an administration of change and remember this congress as a congress of destiny

 together we not only cut the increase in government spend nearly in half we bring about the large tax reduction and the most sweeping change in our tax structure since the beginning of this century and because we index future taxis to the rate of inflation we take away government 's build in profit on inflation and its hidden incentive to grow large at the expense of american workers.-

 together after 50 year of take power away from the hand of the people in their states and local community we have start return power and resource to they

 together we have cut the growth of new federal regulation nearly in half in 1981 there be 23,000 few page in the federal register which list new regulation than there be in 1980 by deregulate oil we have come close to achieve energy independence and help bring down the cost of gasoline and heating fuel

 together we have create an effective federal strike force to combat waste and fraud in government in just 6 month it have save the taxpayer more than $ 2 billion and it be only getting start

 together we have begin to mobilize the private sector not to duplicate wasteful and discredit government program but to bring thousand of americans into a volunteer effort to help solve many of america 's social problem

 together we have begin to restore that margin of military safety that ensure peace our country 's uniform be be wear once again with pride

 together we have make a new beginning but we have only begin

 no one pretend that the way ahead will be easy in my inaugural address last year i warn that the ill we suffer have come upon we over several decade they will not go away in day week or month but they will go away because we as americans have the capacity now as we have have it in the past to do whatever need to be do to preserve this last and great bastion of freedom

 the economy will face difficult moment in the month ahead but the program for economic recovery that be in place will pull the economy out of its slump and put we on the road to prosperity and stable growth by the latter half of this year and that be why i can report to you tonight that in the near future the state of the union and the economy will be well much well if we summon the strength to continue on the course that we have chart

 and so the question if the fundamental be in place what now well two thing first we must understand what be happen at the moment to the economy our current problem be not the product of the recovery program that be only just now get underway as some would have you believe they be the inheritance of decade of tax and tax and spend and spend

 second because our economic problem be deeply rooted and will not respond to quick political fix we must stick to our carefully integrate plan for recovery that plan be base on four commonsense fundamental continue reduction of the growth in federal spending preserve the individual and business tax reduction that will stimulate saving and investment remove unnecessary federal regulation to spark productivity and maintain a healthy dollar and a stable monetary policy the latter a responsibility of the federal reserve system

 the only alternative be offer to this economic program be a return to the policy that give we a trillion dollar debt runaway inflation runaway interest rate and unemployment the doubter would have we turn back the clock with tax increase that would offset the personal tax rate reduction already pass by this congress raise present taxis to cut future deficit they tell we well i do not believe we should buy that argument

 there be too many imponderable for anyone to predict deficit or surplus several year ahead with any degree of accuracy the budget in place when i take office have be project as balanced it turn out to have one of the big deficit in history another example of the imponderable that can make deficit projection highly questionable a change of only one percentage point in unemployment can alter a deficit up or down by some $ 25 billion

 as it now stand our forecast which we be require by law to make will show major deficit start at less than a hundred billion dollar and decline but still too high more important we be make progress with the three key to reduce deficit economic growth low interest rate and spending control the policy we have in place will reduce the deficit steadily surely and in time completely

 high taxis would not mean low deficit if they do how would we explain that tax revenue more than double just since 1976 yet in that same 6 year period we run the large series of deficit in our history in 1980 tax revenue increase by $ 54 billion and in 1980 we have one of our all time big deficit raise taxis will not balance the budget it will encourage more government spending and less private investment raise taxis will slow economic growth reduce production and destroy future job make it more difficult for those without job to find they and more likely that those who now have job could lose they so i will not ask you to try to balance the budget on the back of the american taxpayer

 i will seek no tax increase this year and i have no intention of retreat from our basic program of tax relief i promise to bring the american people to bring their tax rate down and to keep they down to provide they incentive to rebuild our economy to save to invest in america 's future i will stand by my word tonight i be urge the american people seize these new opportunity to produce to save to invest and together we will make this economy a mighty engine of freedom hope and prosperity again

 now the budget deficit this year will exceed our early expectation the recession do that it lower revenue and increase cost to some extent we be also victim of our own success we have bring inflation down fast than we think we could and in do this we have deprive government of those hide revenue that occur when inflation push people into high income tax bracket and the continue high interest rate last year cost the government about $ 5 billion more than anticipate

 we must cut out more nonessential government spending and rout out more waste and we will continue our effort to reduce the number of employee in the federal work force by 75,000

 the budget plan i submit to you on february 8th will realize major saving by dismantle the departments of energy and education and by eliminate ineffective subsidy for business we will continue to redirect our resource to our two high budget priority a strong national defense to keep america free and at peace and a reliable safety net of social program for those who have contribute and those who be in need

 contrary to some of the wild charge you may have hear this administration have not and will not turn its back on america 's elderly or america 's poor under the new budget fund for social insurance program will be more than double the amount spend only 6 year ago but it would be foolish to pretend that these or any program can not be make more efficient and economical

 the entitlement program that make up our safety net for the truly needy have worthy goal and many deserving recipient we will protect they but there be only one way to see to it that these program really help those whom they be design to help and that be to bring their spiral cost under control

 today we face the absurd situation of a federal budget with three quarter of its expenditure routinely refer to as uncontrollable and a large part of this go to entitlement program

 committee after committee of this congress have hear witness after witness describe many of these program as poorly administer and rife with waste and fraud virtually every american who shop in a local supermarket be aware of the daily abuse that take place in the food stamp program which have grow by 16,000 percent in the last 15 year another example be medicare and medicaid program with worthy goal but whose cost have increase from 11.2 billion to almost 60 billion more than 5 time as much in just 10 year

 waste and fraud be serious problem back in 1980 federal investigator testify before one of your committee that corruption have permeate virtually every area of the medicare and medicaid health care industry one official say many of the people who be cheat the system be very confident that nothing be go to happen to they well something be go to happen not only the taxpayer be defraud the people with real dependency on these program be deprive of what they need because available resource be go not to the needy but to the greedy

 the time have come to control the uncontrollable in august we make a start i sign a bill to reduce the growth of these program by $ 44 billion over the next 3 year while at the same time preserve essential service for the truly needy shortly you will receive from i a message on further reform we intend to install some new but other long recommend by your own congressional committee i ask you to help make these saving for the american taxpayer

 the saving we propose in entitlement program will total some $ 63 billion over 4 year and will without affect social t security go a long way toward bring federal spending under control

 but do not be fool by those who proclaim that spending cut will deprive the elderly the needy and the helpless the federal government will still subsidize 95 million meal every day that be one out of seven of all the meal serve in america head start senior nutrition program and child welfare program will not be cut from the level we propose last year more than one half billion dollar have be propose for minority business assistance and research at the national institute of health will be increase by over $ 100 million while meet all these need we intend to plug unwarranted tax loophole and strengthen the law which require all large corporation to pay a minimum tax

 i be confident the economic program we have put into operation will protect the needy while it trigger a recovery that will benefit all americans it will stimulate the economy result in increase saving and provide capital for expansion mortgage for homebuilding and job for the unemployed

 now that the essential of that program be in place our next major undertaking must be a program just as bold just as innovative to make government again accountable to the people to make our system of federalism work again

 our citizen feel they have lose control of even the most basic decision make about the essential service of government such as school welfare road and even garbage collection and they be right a maze of interlock jurisdiction and level of government confront average citizen in try to solve even the simple of problem they do not know where to turn for answer who to hold accountable who to praise who to blame who to vote for or against the main reason for this be the overpower growth of federal grant in aid program during the past few decade

 in 1960 the federal government have 132 categorical grant program cost $ 7 billion when i take office there be approximately 500 cost nearly a hundred billion dollars—13 program for energy 36 for pollution control 66 for social service 90 for education and here in the congress it take at least 166 committee just to try to keep track of they

 you know and i know that neither the president nor the congress can properly oversee this jungle of grant in aid indeed the growth of these grant have lead to the distortion in the vital function of government as one democratic governor put it recently the national government should be worry about arm control not pothole

 the growth in these federal program have in the word of one intergovernmental commission make the federal government more pervasive more intrusive more unmanageable more ineffective and costly and above all more un accountable let us solve this problem with a single bold stroke the return of some $ 47 billion in federal program to state and local government together with the mean to finance they and a transition period of nearly 10 year to avoid unnecessary disruption

 i will shortly send this congress a message describe this program i want to emphasize however that its full detail will have be work out only after close consultation with congressional state and local official

 start in fiscal 1984 the federal government will assume full responsibility for the cost of the rapidly grow medicaid program to go along with its exist responsibility for medicare as part of a financially equal swap the states will simultaneously take full responsibility for aid to families with dependent children and food stamp this will make welfare less costly and more responsive to genuine need because it will be design and administer close to the grass root and the people it serve

 in 1984 the federal government will apply the full proceed from certain excise taxis to a grass root trust fund that will belong in fair share to the 50 states the total amount flow into this fund will be $ 28 billion a year over the next 4 year the states can use this money in either of two way if they want to continue receive federal grant in such area as transportation education and social service they can use their trust fund money to pay for the grant or to the extent they choose to forgo the federal grant program they can use their trust fund money on their own for those or other purpose there will be a mandatory pass through of part of these fund to local government

 by 1988 the states will be in complete control of over 40 federal grant program the trust fund will start to phase out eventually to disappear and the excise taxis will be turn over to the states they can then preserve low or raise taxis on their own and fund and manage these program as they see fit

 in a single stroke we will be accomplish a realignment that will end cumbersome administration and spiral cost at the federal level while we ensure these program will be more responsive to both the people they be mean to help and the people who pay for they

 hand in hand with this program to strengthen the discretion and flexibility of state and local government we be propose legislation for an experimental effort to improve and develop our depressed urban area in the 1980 's and 90 's this legislation will permit states and locality to apply to the federal government for designation as urban enterprise zone a broad range of special economic incentive in the zone will help attract new business new job new opportunity to america 's inner city and rural town some will say our mission be to save free enterprise well i say we must free enterprise so that together we can save america

 some will also say our states and local community be not up to the challenge of a new and creative partnership well that might have be true 20 year ago before reform like reapportionment and the voting rights act the 10 year extension of which i strongly support it be no long true today this administration have faith in state and local government and the constitutional balance envision by the founding fathers we also believe in the integrity decency and sound good sense of grass root americans

 our faith in the american people be reflect in another major endeavor our private sector initiative task force be seek out successful community model of school church business union foundation and civic program that help community need such group be almost invariably far more efficient than government in run social program

 we be not ask they to replace discard and often discredit government program dollar for dollar service for service we just want to help they perform the good work they choose and help other to profit by their example three hundred and eighty five thousand corporation and private organization be already work on social program range from drug rehabilitation to job training and thousand more americans have write we ask how they can help the volunteer spirit be still alive and well in america

 our nation 's long journey towards civil right for all our citizen once a source of discord now a source of pride must continue with no backsliding or slow down we must and shall see that those basic law that guarantee equal right be preserve and when necessary strengthen

 our concern for equal right for woman be firm and unshakable we launch a new task force on legal equity for women and a fifty states project that will examine state law for discriminatory language and for the first time in our history a woman sit on the high court in the land

 so too the problem of crime one as real and deadly serious as any in america today it demand that we seek transformation of our legal system which overly protect the right of criminal while it leave society and the innocent victim of crime without justice

 we look forward to the enactment of a responsible clean air act to increase job while continue to improve the quality of our air we be encourage by the bipartisan initiative of the house and be hopeful of further progress as the senate continue its deliberation

 so far i have concentrate largely now on domestic matter to view the state of the union in perspective we must not ignore the rest of the world there be not time tonight for a lengthy treatment of social or foreign policy i should say a subject i intend to address in detail in the near future a few word however be in order on the progress we have make over the past year reestablish respect for our nation around the globe and some of the challenge and goal that we will approach in the year ahead

 at ottawa and cancun i meet with leader of the major industrial power and develop nation now some of those i meet with be a little surprised that i do not apologize for america 's wealth instead i speak of the strength of the free marketplace system and how that system could help they realize their aspiration for economic development and political freedom i believe lasting friendship be make and the foundation be lay for future cooperation

 in the vital region of the caribbean basin we be develop a program of aid trade and investment incentive to promote self sustain growth and a well more secure life for our neighbor to the south toward those who would export terrorism and subversion in the caribbean and elsewhere especially cuba and libya we will act with firmness

 our foreign policy be a policy of strength fairness and balance by restore america 's military credibility by pursue peace at the negotiating table wherever both side be willing to sit down in good faith and by regain the respect of america 's ally and adversary alike we have strengthen our country 's position as a force for peace and progress in the world

 when action be call for we be take it our sanction against the military dictatorship that have attempt to crush human right in poland and against the soviet regime behind that military dictatorship clearly demonstrate to the world that america will not conduct business as usual with the force of oppression if the event in poland continue to deteriorate further measure will follow

 now let i also note that private american group have take the lead in make january 30th a day of solidarity with the people of poland so too the european parliament have call for march 21st to be an international day of support for afghanistan well i urge all peace love people to join together on those day to raise their voice to speak and pray for freedom

 meanwhile we be work for reduction of arm and military activity as i announce in my address to the nation last november 18th we have propose to the soviet union a far reach agenda for mutual reduction of military force and have already initiate negotiation with they in geneva on intermediate range nuclear force in those talk it be essential that we negotiate from a position of strength there must be a real incentive for the soviets to take these talk seriously this require that we rebuild our defense

 in the last decade while we seek the moderation of soviet power through a process of restraint and accommodation the soviets engage in an unrelenting buildup of their military force the protection of our national security have require that we undertake a substantial program to enhance our military force

 we have not neglect to strengthen our traditional alliance in europe and asia or to develop key relationship with our partner in the middle east and other country build a more peaceful world require a sound strategy and the national resolve to back it up when radical force threaten our friend when economic misfortune create condition of instability when strategically vital part of the world fall under the shadow of soviet power our response can make the difference between peaceful change or disorder and violence that be why we have lay such stress not only on our own defense but on our vital foreign assistance program your recent passage of the foreign assistance act send a signal to the world that america will not shrink from make the investment necessary for both peace and security our foreign policy must be root in realism not naivete or self delusion

 a recognition of what the soviet empire be about be the starting point winston churchill in negotiate with the soviets observe that they respect only strength and resolve in their dealing with other nation that be why we have move to reconstruct our national defense we intend to keep the peace we will also keep our freedom

 we have make pledge of a new frankness in our public statement and worldwide broadcast in the face of a climate of falsehood and misinformation we have promise the world a season of truth the truth of our great civilized idea individual liberty representative government the rule of law under god we have never need wall or minefield or barbed wire to keep our people in nor do we declare martial law to keep our people from vote for the kind of government they want

 yes we have our problem yes we be in a time of recession and it be true there be no quick fix as i say to instantly end the tragic pain of unemployment but we will end it the process have already begin and we will see its effect as the year go on

 we speak with pride and admiration of that little band of americans who overcome insuperable odd to set this nation on course 200 year ago but our glory do not end with they american ever since have emulate their deed

 we do not have to turn to our history book for hero they be all around we one who sit among you here tonight epitomize that heroism at the end of the long imprisonment ever inflict on man of our armed forces who will ever forget that night when we wait for television to bring we the scene of that first plane landing at clark field in the philippines bring our pow 's home the plane door open and jeremiah denton come slowly down the ramp he catch sight of our flag salute it say god bless america and then thank we for bring he home

 just 2 week ago in the midst of a terrible tragedy on the potomac we see again the spirit of american heroism at its fine the heroism of dedicated rescue worker save crash victim from icy water and we see the heroism of one of our young government employee lenny skutnik who when he see a woman lose her grip on the helicopter line dive into the water and drag she to safety

 and then there be countless quiet everyday hero of american who sacrifice long and hard so their child will know a well life than they have know church and civic volunteer who help to feed clothe nurse and teach the needy million who have make our nation and our nation 's destiny so very special unsung hero who may not have realize their own dream themselves but then who reinvest those dream in their child do not let anyone tell you that america 's good day be behind she that the american spirit have be vanquish we have see it triumph too often in our life to stop believe in it now

 a hundred and twenty year ago the great of all our president deliver his second state of the union message in this chamber we can not escape history abraham lincoln warn we of this congress and this administration will be remember in spite of ourselves the trial through which we pass will light we down in honor or dishonor to the late last generation

 well that president and that congress do not fail the american people together they weather the storm and preserve the union let it be say of we that we too do not fail that we too work together to bring america through difficult time let we so conduct ourselves that two century from now another congress and another president meet in this chamber as we be meet will speak of we with pride say that we meet the test and preserve for they in their day the sacred flame of liberty this last good hope of man on earth

 god bless you and thank you

my lord chancellor mr. speaker
 the journey of which this visit form a part be a long one already it have take i to two great city of the west rome and paris and to the economic summit at versailles and there once again our sister democracy have prove that even in a time of severe economic strain free people can work together freely and voluntarily to address problem as serious as inflation unemployment trade and economic development in a spirit of cooperation and solidarity
 other milestone lie ahead later this week in germany we and our nato ally will discuss measure for our joint defense and america 's late initiative for a more peaceful secure world through arm reduction
 each stop of this trip be important but among they all this moment occupy a special place in my heart and in the heart of my countryman a moment of kinship and homecoming in these hallowed hall
 speak for all americans i want to say how very much at home we feel in your house every american would because this be as we have be so eloquently tell one of democracy 's shrine here the right of free people and the process of representation have be debate and refine
 it have be say that an institution be the lengthen shadow of a man this institution be the lengthen shadow of all the man and woman who have sit here and all those who have vote to send representative here
 this be my second visit to great britain as president of the united states my first opportunity to stand on british soil occur almost a year and a half ago when your prime minister graciously host a diplomatic dinner at the british embassy in washington mrs. thatcher say then that she hope i be not distressed to find stare down at i from the grand staircase a portrait of his royal majesty king george iii she suggest it be good to let bygone be bygone and in view of our two country remarkable friendship in succeed year she add that most englishman today would agree with thomas jefferson that a little rebellion now and then be a very good thing laughter
 well from here i will go to bonn and then berlin where there stand a grim symbol of power untame the berlin wall that dreadful gray gash across the city be in its third decade it be the fitting signature of the regime that build it
 and a few hundred kilometer behind the berlin wall there be another symbol in the center of warsaw there be a sign that note the distance to two capital in one direction it point toward moscow in the other it point toward brussels headquarters of western europe 's tangible unity the marker say that the distance from warsaw to moscow and warsaw to brussels be equal the sign make this point poland be not east or west poland be at the center of european civilization it have contribute mightily to that civilization it be do so today by be magnificently unreconciled to oppression
 poland 's struggle to be poland and to secure the basic right we often take for grant demonstrate why we dare not take those right for grant gladstone defend the reform bill of 1866 declare you can not fight against the future time be on our side it be easy to believe in the march of democracy in gladstone 's day in that high noon of victorian optimism
 we be approach the end of a bloody century plague by a terrible political invention totalitarianism optimism come less easily today not because democracy be less vigorous but because democracy 's enemy have refine their instrument of repression yet optimism be in order because day by day democracy be prove itself to be a not at all fragile flower from stettin on the baltic to varna on the black sea the regime plant by totalitarianism have have more than 30 year to establish their legitimacy but none not one regime have yet be able to risk free election regimes plant by bayonet do not take root
 the strength of the solidarity movement in poland demonstrate the truth tell in an underground joke in the soviet union it be that the soviet union would remain a one party nation even if an opposition party be permit because everyone would join the opposition party laughter
 america 's time as a player on the stage of world history have be brief i think understand this fact have always make you patient with your young cousin well not always patient i do recall that on one occasion sir winston churchill say in exasperation about one of our most distinguished diplomat he be the only case i know of a bull who carry his china shop with he laughter
 but witty as sir winston be he also have that special attribute of great statesman the gift of vision the willingness to see the future base on the experience of the past it be this sense of history this understanding of the past that i want to talk with you about today for it be in remember what we share of the past that our two nation can make common cause for the future
 we have not inherit an easy world if development like the industrial revolution which begin here in england and the gift of science and technology have make life much easy for we they have also make it more dangerous there be threat now to our freedom indeed to our very existence that other generation could never even have imagine
 there be first the threat of global war no president no congress no prime minister no parliament can spend a day entirely free of this threat and i do not have to tell you that in today 's world the existence of nuclear weapon could mean if not the extinction of mankind then surely the end of civilization as we know it that be why negotiation on intermediate range nuclear force now underway in europe and the start talk strategic arms reduction talks which will begin later this month be not just critical to american or western policy they be critical to mankind our commitment to early success in these negotiation be firm and unshakable and our purpose be clear reduce the risk of war by reduce the mean of wage war on both side
 at the same time there be a threat pose to human freedom by the enormous power of the modern state history teach the danger of government that overreach political control take precedence over free economic growth secret police mindless bureaucracy all combine to stifle individual excellence and personal freedom
 now i be aware that among we here and throughout europe there be legitimate disagreement over the extent to which the public sector should play a role in a nation 's economy and life but on one point all of we be unite our abhorrence of dictatorship in all its form but most particularly totalitarianism and the terrible inhumanity it have cause in our time the great purge auschwitz and dachau the gulag and cambodia
 historian look back at our time will note the consistent restraint and peaceful intention of the west they will note that it be the democracy who refuse to use the threat of their nuclear monopoly in the forty and early fifty for territorial or imperial gain have that nuclear monopoly be in the hand of the communist world the map of europe indeed the world would look very different today and certainly they will note it be not the democracy that invade afghanistan or supresse polish solidarity or use chemical and toxin warfare in afghanistan and southeast asia
 if history teach anything it teach self delusion in the face of unpleasant fact be folly we see around we today the mark of our terrible dilemma prediction of doomsday antinuclear demonstration an arm race in which the west must for its own protection be an unwilling participant at the same time we see totalitarian force in the world who seek subversion and conflict around the globe to further their barbarous assault on the human spirit what then be our course must civilization perish in a hail of fiery atom must freedom wither in a quiet deaden accommodation with totalitarian evil
 sir winston churchill refuse to accept the inevitability of war or even that it be imminent he say i do not believe that soviet russia desire war what they desire be the fruit of war and the indefinite expansion of their power and doctrine but what we have to consider here today while time remain be the permanent prevention of war and the establishment of condition of freedom and democracy as rapidly as possible in all country
 well this be precisely our mission today to preserve freedom as well as peace it may not be easy to see but i believe we live now at a turning point
 in an ironic sense karl marx be right we be witness today a great revolutionary crisis a crisis where the demand of the economic order be conflict directly with those of the political order but the crisis be happen not in the free non marxist west but in the home of marxist leninism the soviet union it be the soviet union that run against the tide of history by deny human freedom and human dignity to its citizen it also be in deep economic difficulty the rate of growth in the national product have be steadily decline since the fifty and be less than half of what it be then
 the dimension of this failure be astounding a country which employ one fifth of its population in agriculture be unable to feed its own people be it not for the private sector the tiny private sector tolerate in soviet agriculture the country might be on the brink of famine these private plot occupy a bare 3 percent of the arable land but account for nearly one quarter of soviet farm output and nearly one third of meat product and vegetable overcentralize with little or no incentive year after year the soviet system pour its good resource into the making of instrument of destruction the constant shrinkage of economic growth combine with the growth of military production be put a heavy strain on the soviet people what we see here be a political structure that no long correspond to its economic base a society where productive force be hamper by political one
 the decay of the soviet experiment should come as no surprise to we wherever the comparison have be make between free and closed society west germany and east germany austria and czechoslovakia malaysia and vietnam it be the democratic country what be prosperous and responsive to the need of their people and one of the simple but overwhelming fact of our time be this of all the million of refugee we have see in the modern world their flight be always away from not toward the communist world today on the nato line our military force face east to prevent a possible invasion on the other side of the line the soviet force also face east to prevent their people from leave
 the hard evidence of totalitarian rule have cause in mankind an uprising of the intellect and will whether it be the growth of the new school of economic in america or england or the appearance of the so call new philosopher in france there be one unifying thread run through the intellectual work of these group rejection of the arbitrary power of the state the refusal to subordinate the right of the individual to the superstate the realization that collectivism stifle all the good human impulse
 since the exodus from egypt historian have write of those who sacrifice and struggle for freedom the stand at thermopylae the revolt of spartacus the storming of the bastille the warsaw uprising in world war ii more recently we have see evidence of this same human impulse in one of the develop nation in central america for month and month the world news medium cover the fighting in el salvador day after day we be treat to story and film slant toward the brave freedom fighter battle oppressive government force in behalf of the silent suffer people of that torture country
 and then one day those silent suffer people be offer a chance to vote to choose the kind of government they want suddenly the freedom fighter in the hill be expose for what they really be cuban back guerrilla who want power for themselves and their backer not democracy for the people they threaten death to any who vote and destroy hundred of bus and truck to keep the people from get to the polling place but on election day the people of el salvador an unprecedented 1.4 million of they brave ambush and gunfire and trudge for mile to vote for freedom
 they stand for hour in the hot sun wait for their turn to vote member of our congress who go there as observer tell i of a woman who be wound by rifle fire on the way to the poll who refuse to leave the line to have her wound treat until after she have vote a grandmother who have be tell by the guerrilla she would be kill when she return from the poll and she tell the guerrilla you can kill i you can kill my family kill my neighbor but you can not kill we all the real freedom fighter of el salvador turn out to be the people of that country the young the old the in between
 strange but in my own country there be be little if any news coverage of that war since the election now perhaps they will say it's well because there be new struggle now
 on distant island in the south atlantic young man be fight for britain and yes voice have be raise protest their sacrifice for lump of rock and earth so far away but those young man be not fight for mere real estate they fight for a cause for the belief that armed aggression must not be allow to succeed and the people must participate in the decision of government—[applause]—the decision of government under the rule of law if there have be firm support for that principle some 45 year ago perhaps our generation would not have suffer the bloodletting of world war ii
 in the middle east now the gun sound once more this time in lebanon a country that for too long have have to endure the tragedy of civil war terrorism and foreign intervention and occupation the fighting in lebanon on the part of all party must stop and israel should bring its force home but this be not enough we must all work to stamp out the scourge of terrorism that in the middle east make war an ever present threat
 but beyond the troublespot lie a deep more positive pattern around the world today the democratic revolution be gather new strength in india a critical test have be pass with the peaceful change of govern political party in africa nigeria be move into remarkable and unmistakable way to build and strengthen its democratic institution in the caribbean and central america 16 of 24 country have freely elect government and in the united nations 8 of the 10 develop nation which have join that body in the past 5 year be democracy
 in the communist world as well man 's instinctive desire for freedom and self determination surface again and again to be sure there be grim reminder of how brutally the police state attempt to snuff out this quest for self rule—1953 in east germany 1956 in hungary 1968 in czechoslovakia 1981 in poland but the struggle continue in poland and we know that there be even those who strive and suffer for freedom within the confine of the soviet union itself how we conduct ourselves here in the western democracy will determine whether this trend continue
 no democracy be not a fragile flower still it need cultivate if the rest of this century be to witness the gradual growth of freedom and democratic ideal we must take action to assist the campaign for democracy
 some argue that we should encourage democratic change in right wing dictatorship but not in communist regime well to accept this preposterous notion as some well mean people have be to invite the argument that once country achieve a nuclear capability they should be allow an undisturbed reign of terror over their own citizen we reject this course
 as for the soviet view chairman brezhnev repeatedly have stress that the competition of idea and system must continue and that this be entirely consistent with relaxation of tension and peace
 well we ask only that these system begin by live up to their own constitution abide by their own law and comply with the international obligation they have undertake we ask only for a process a direction a basic code of decency not for an instant transformation
 we can not ignore the fact that even without our encouragement there have be and will continue to be repeat explosion against repression and dictatorship the soviet union itself be not immune to this reality any system be inherently unstable that have no peaceful mean to legitimize its leader in such case the very repressiveness of the state ultimately drive people to resist it if necessary by force
 while we must be cautious about force the pace of change we must not hesitate to declare our ultimate objective and to take concrete action to move toward they we must be staunch in our conviction that freedom be not the sole prerogative of a lucky few but the inalienable and universal right of all human being so state the united nations universal declaration of human rights which among other thing guarantee free election
 the objective i propose be quite simple to state to foster the infrastructure of democracy the system of a free press union political party university which allow a people to choose their own way to develop their own culture to reconcile their own difference through peaceful mean
 this be not cultural imperialism it be provide the mean for genuine self determination and protection for diversity democracy already flourish in country with very different culture and historical experience it would be cultural condescension or bad to say that any people prefer dictatorship to democracy who would voluntarily choose not to have the right to vote decide to purchase government propaganda handout instead of independent newspaper prefer government to worker control union opt for land to be own by the state instead of those who till it want government repression of religious liberty a single political party instead of a free choice a rigid cultural orthodoxy instead of democratic tolerance and diversity
 since 1917 the soviet union have give covert political training and assistance to marxist leninists in many country of course it also have promote the use of violence and subversion by these same force over the past several decade west european and other social democrats christian democrats and leader have offer open assistance to fraternal political and social institution to bring about peaceful and democratic progress appropriately for a vigorous new democracy the federal republic of germany 's political foundation have become a major force in this effort
 we in america now intend to take additional step as many of our ally have already do toward realize this same goal the chairman and other leader of the national republican and democratic party organization be initiate a study with the bipartisan american political foundation to determine how the united states can well contribute as a nation to the global campaign for democracy now gather force they will have the cooperation of congressional leader of both party along with representative of business labor and other major institution in our society i look forward to receive their recommendation and to work with these institution and the congress in the common task of strengthen democracy throughout the world
 it be time that we commit ourselves as a nation in both the public and private sector to assist democratic development
 we plan to consult with leader of other nation as well there be a proposal before the council of europe to invite parliamentarian from democratic country to a meeting next year in strasbourg that prestigious gathering could consider way to help democratic political movement
 this november in washington there will take place an international meeting on free election and next spring there will be a conference of world authority on constitutionalism and self goverment host by the chief justice of the united states authority from a number of develop and developed country judge philosopher and politician with practical experience have agree to explore how to turn principle into practice and far the rule of law
 at the same time we invite the soviet union to consider with we how the competition of idea and value which it be commit to support can be conduct on a peaceful and reciprocal basis for example i be prepared to offer president brezhnev an opportunity to speak to the american people on our television if he will allow i the same opportunity with the soviet people we also suggest that panel of our newsman periodically appear on each other 's television to discuss major event
 now i do not wish to sound overly optimistic yet the soviet union be not immune from the reality of what be go on in the world it have happen in the past a small rule elite either mistakenly attempt to ease domestic unrest through great repression and foreign adventure or it choose a wise course it begin to allow its people a voice in their own destiny even if this latter process be not realize soon i believe the renew strength of the democratic movement complement by a global campaign for freedom will strengthen the prospect for arm control and a world at peace
 i have discuss on other occasion include my address on may 9th the element of western policy toward the soviet union to safeguard our interest and protect the peace what i be describe now be a plan and a hope for the long term the march of freedom and democracy which will leave marxism leninism on the ash heap of history as it have leave other tyranny which stifle the freedom and muzzle the self expression of the people and that be why we must continue our effort to strengthen nato even as we move forward with our zero option initiative in the negotiation on intermediate range force and our proposal for a one third reduction in strategic ballistic missile warhead
 our military strength be a prerequisite to peace but let it be clear we maintain this strength in the hope it will never be use for the ultimate determinant in the struggle that be now go on in the world will not be bomb and rocket but a test of will and idea a trial of spiritual resolve the value we hold the belief we cherish the ideal to which we be dedicate
 the british people know that give strong leadership time and a little bit of hope the force of good ultimately rally and triumph over evil here among you be the cradle of self government the mother of parliaments here be the endure greatness of the british contribution to mankind the great civilized idea individual liberty representative government and the rule of law under god
 i have often wonder about the shyness of some of we in the west about stand for these ideal that have do so much to ease the plight of man and the hardship of our imperfect world this reluctance to use those vast resource at our command remind i of the elderly lady whose home be bomb in the blitz as the rescuer move about they find a bottle of brandy she have store behind the staircase which be all that be leave stand and since she be barely conscious one of the worker pull the cork to give she a taste of it she come around immediately and say here now there now put it back that be for emergency laughter
 well the emergency be upon we let we be shy no long let we go to our strength let we offer hope let we tell the world that a new age be not only possible but probable
 during the dark day of the second world war when this island be incandescent with courage winston churchill exclaim about britain 's adversary what kind of a people do they think we be well britain 's adversary find out what extraordinary people the british be but all the democracy pay a terrible price for allow the dictator to underestimate we we dare not make that mistake again so let we ask ourselves what kind of people do we think we be and let we answer free people worthy of freedom and determine not only to remain so but to help other gain their freedom as well
 sir winston lead his people to great victory in war and then lose an election just as the fruit of victory be about to be enjoy but he leave office honorably and as it turn out temporarily know that the liberty of his people be more important than the fate of any single leader history recall his greatness in way no dictator will ever know and he leave we a message of hope for the future as timely now as when he first utter it as opposition leader in the commons nearly 27 year ago when he say when we look back on all the peril through which we have pass and at the mighty foe that we have lay low and all the dark and deadly design that we have frustrate why should we fear for our future we have he say come safely through the bad
 well the task i have set forth will long outlive our own generation but together we too have come through the bad let we now begin a major effort to secure the good a crusade for freedom that will engage the faith and fortitude of the next generation for the sake of peace and justice let we move toward a world in which all people be at last free to determine their own destiny
 thank you

mr. president chancellor schmidt member of the bundestag distinguished guest

 perhaps because i have just come from london i have this urge to quote the great dr. johnson who say the feeling of friendship be like that of be comfortably fill with roast beef laughter well i feel very much fill with friendship this afternoon and i bring you the warm regard and goodwill of the american people

 i be very honored to speak to you today and thus to all the people of germany next year we will jointly celebrate the 300th anniversary of the first german settlement in the american colonies the 13 family who come to our new land be the forerunner of more than 7 million german immigrant to the united states today more americans claim german ancestry than any other

 these germans clear and cultivate our land build our industry and advance our art and science in honor of 300 year of german contribution in america president carstens and i have agree today that he will pay an official visit to the united states in october of 1983 to celebrate the occasion

 the german people have give we so much we like to think that we have repay some of that debt our american revolution be the first revolution in modern history to be fight for the right of self government and the guarantee of civil liberty that spirit be contagious in 1849 the frankfurt parliament 's statement of basic human right guarantee freedom of expression freedom of religion and equality before the law and these principle live today in the basic law of the federal republic many people to the east still wait for such right

 the united states be proud of your democracy but we can not take credit for it heinrich heine in speak of those who build the awe inspire cathedral of medieval time say that in those day people have conviction we modern have only opinion and it require something more than opinion he say to build a gothic cathedral well over the past 30 year the conviction of the german people have build a cathedral of democracy a great and glorious testament to your ideal we in america genuinely admire the free society that you have build in only a few decade and we understand all the well what you have accomplish because of our own history

 americans speak with the deep reverence of those found fathers and first citizen who give we the freedom that we enjoy today and even though they live over 200 year ago we carry they in our heart as well as in our history book

 i believe future generation of germans will look to you here today and to your fellow germans with the same profound respect and appreciation you have build a free society with an abide faith in human dignity the crown ideal of western civilization this will not be forget you will be salute and honor by this republic 's descendant over the century to come

 yesterday before the british parliament i speak of the value of western civilization and the necessity to help all people gain the institution of freedom in many way in many place our ideal be be test today we be meet this afternoon between two important summit the gathering of lead industrial democracy at versailles and the assembly of the atlantic alliance here in bonn tomorrow critical and complex problem face we but our dilemma will be make easy if we remember our partnership be base on a common western heritage and a faith in democracy

 i believe this partnership of the atlantic alliance nation be motivate primarily by the search for peace inner peace for our citizen and peace among nation why inner peace because democracy allow for self expression it respect man 's dignity and creativity it operate by a rule of law not by terror or coercion it be government with the consent of the governed as a result citizen of the atlantic alliance enjoy an unprecedented level of material and spiritual well being and they be free to find their own personal peace

 we also seek peace among nation the psalmist say seek peace and pursue it well our foreign policy be base on this principle and direct toward this end the noble objective of our diplomacy be the patient and difficult task of reconcile our adversary to peace and i know we all look forward to the day when the only industry of man war]1 will be the research of historian

 but the simple hope for peace be not enough we must remember something that friedrich schiller say the most pious man can not stay in peace if it do not please his evil neighbor so there must be a method to our search a method that recognize the danger and reality of the world

 during chancellor schmidt 's state visit to washington last year i say that your republic be perch on a cliff of freedom i be not say anything the german people do not already know live as you do in the heart of a divide europe you can see more clearly than other that there be government at peace neither with their own people nor the world

 i do not believe any reasonable observer can deny that there be a threat to both peace and freedom today it be as stark as that gash of a border that separate the german people we be menace by a power that openly condemn our value and answer our restraint with a relentless military buildup

 we can not simply assume every nation want the peace that we so earnestly desire the polish people would tell we there be those who would use military force to repress other who want only basic human right the freedom fighter of afghanistan would tell we as well that the threat of aggression have not recede from the world

 without a strengthen atlantic security the possibility of military coercion will be very great we must continue to improve our defense if we be to preserve peace and freedom this be be there an echo in here laughter and applause

 but this preserve peace and freedom be not an impossible task for almost 40 year we have succeed in deter war our method have be to organize our defensive capability both nuclear and conventional so that an aggressor could have no hope of military victory the alliance have carry its strength not as a battle flag but as a banner of peace deterrence have keep that peace and we must continue to take the step necessary to make deterrence credible

 this depend in part on a strong america a national effort entail sacrifice by the american people be now underway to make long overdue improvement in our military posture the american people support this effort because they understand how fundamental it be to keep the peace they so fervently desire

 we also be resolve to maintain the presence of well equip and train force in europe and our strategic force will be modernize and remain committed to the alliance by these action the people of the united states be say we be with you germany you be not alone our adversary would be foolishly mistaken should they gamble that americans would abandon their alliance responsibility no matter how severe the test

 alliance security depend on a fully credible conventional defense to which all ally contribute there be a danger that any conflict could escalate to a nuclear war strong conventional force can make the danger of conventional or nuclear conflict more remote reasonable strength in and of itself be not bad it be honorable when use to maintain peace or defend deeply hold belief

 one of the first chore be to fulfill our commitment to each other by continue to strengthen our conventional defense this must include improve the readiness of our standing force and the ability of those force to operate as one we must also apply the west 's technological genius to improve our conventional deterrence

 there can be no doubt that we as an alliance have the mean to improve our conventional defense our people hold value of individual liberty and dignity that time and again they have prove willing to defend our economic energy vastly exceed that of our adversary our free system have produce technological advance that other system with their stifle ideology can not hope to equal all of these resource be available to our defense

 yes many of our nation currently be experience economic difficulty yet we must nevertheless guarantee that our security do not suffer as a result we have make stride in conventional defense over the last few year despite our economic problem and we have disprove the pessimist who contend that our effort be futile the more we close the conventional gap the less the risk of aggression or nuclear conflict

 the soil of germany and of every other ally be of vital concern to each member of the alliance and this fundamental commitment be embody in the north atlantic treaty but it will be an empty pledge unless we ensure that american force be ready to reinforce europe and europe be ready to receive they

 i be encourage by the recent agreement on wartime host nation support this pact strengthen our ability to deter aggression in europe and demonstrate our common determination to respond to attack just as each ally share fully in the security of the alliance each be responsible for shoulder a fair share of the burden now that of course often lead to a difference of opinion and criticism of our alliance be as old as the partnership itself but voice have now be raise on both side of the atlantic that mistake the inevitable process of adjustment within the alliance for a dramatic divergence of interest

 some americans think that europeans be too little concerned for their own security some would unilaterally reduce the number of american troop deploy in europe and in europe itself we hear the idea that the american presence rather than contribute to peace either have no deterrent value or actually increase the risk that our allies may be attack

 these argument ignore both the history and the reality of the transatlantic coalition let i assure you that the american commitment to europe remain steady and strong europe 's shore be our shore europe 's border be our border and we will stand with you in defense of our heritage of liberty and dignity

 the american people recognize europe 's substantial contribution to our joint security nowhere be that contribution more evident than here in the federal republic german citizen host the force of six nation german soldier and reservist provide the backbone of nato 's conventional deterrent in the heartland of europe your bundeswehr be a model for the integration of defense need with a democratic way of life and you have not shrink from the heavy responsibility of accept the nuclear force necessary for deterrence

 i ask your help in fulfil another responsibility many american citizen do not believe that their counterpart in europe especially young citizen really understand the united states presence there now if you will work toward explain the u.s. role to people on this side of the atlantic i will explain it to those on the other side

 in recent month both in your country and mine there have be renew public concern about the threat of nuclear war and the arm buildup i know it be not easy especially for the german people to live in the gale of intimidation that blow from the east

 if i might quote heine again he almost foretold the fear of nuclear war when he write wild dark time be rumble toward we and the prophet who wish to write a new apocalypse will have to invent entirely new beast and beast so terrible that the ancient animal symbol will seem like coo dove and cupid in comparison the nuclear threat be a terrible beast perhaps the banner carry in one of the nuclear demonstration here in germany say it well the sign read i be afraid

 well i know of no western leader who do not sympathize with that earnest plea to those who march for peace my heart be with you i would be at the head of your parade if i believe march alone could bring about a more secure world and to the 2,800 woman in filderstadt who spend a petition for peace to president brezhnev and i let i say i myself would sign your petition if i think it could bring about harmony i understand your genuine concern

 the woman of filderstadt and i share the same goal the question be how to proceed we must think through the consequence of how we reduce the danger to peace

 those who advocate that we unilaterally forego the modernization of our force must prove that this will enhance our security and lead to moderation by the other side in short that it will advance rather than undermine the preservation of the peace the weight of recent history do not support this notion

 those who demand that we renounce the use of a crucial element of our deterrent strategy must show how this would decrease the likelihood of war it be only by comparison with a nuclear war that the suffering cause by conventional war seem a less evil our goal must be to deter war of any kind

 and those who decry the failure of arm control effort to achieve substantial result must consider where the fault lie i would remind they that it be the united states that have propose to ban land base intermediate range nuclear missile the missile most threaten to europe it be the united states that have propose and will pursue deep cut in strategic system it be the west that have long seek the detailed exchange of information on force and effective verification procedure and it be dictatorship not democracy that need militarism to control their own people and impose their system on other

 to those who have take a different viewpoint and who can not see this danger i do not suggest that they be ignorant it be just that they know so many thing that be not true

 we in the west germans americans our other allies be deeply committed to continue effort to restrict the arm competition common sense demand that we persevere i invite those who genuinely seek effective and lasting arm control to stand behind the far reach proposal that we have put forward in return i pledge that we will sustain the close of consultation with our allies

 on november 18th i outline a broad and ambitious arm control program one element call for reduce land base intermediate range nuclear missile to zero on each side if carry out it would eliminate the grow threat to western europe pose by the u.s.s.r. 's modern ss-20 rocket and it would make unnecessary the nato decision to deploy american intermediate range system and by the way i can not understand why among some there be a great fear of weapon nato be to deploy than of weapon the soviet union already have deploy

 our proposal be fair because it impose equal limit and obligation on both side and it call for significant reduction not merely a capping of an exist high level of destructive power as you know we have make this proposal in geneva where negotiation have be underway since the end of november last year we intend to pursue those negotiation intensively i regard they as a significant test of the soviets willingness to enter into meaningful arm control agreement

 on may 9th we propose to the soviet union that strategic arms reductions talks begin this month in geneva the u.s.s.r. have agree and talk will begin on june 29th we in the united states want to focus on the most destabilizing system and thus reduce the risk of war and that be why in the first phase we propose to reduce substantially the number of ballistic missile warhead and the missile themselves in the second phase we will seek an equal ceiling on other element of our strategic force include ballistic missile throwweight at less than current american level we will handle cruise missile and bomber in an equitable fashion we will negotiate in good faith and undertake these talk with the same seriousness of purpose that have mark our preparation over the last several month

 another element of the program i outline be a call for reduction in conventional force in europe from the early postwar year the western democracy have face the ominous reality that massive soviet conventional force would remain station where they do not belong the muscle of soviet force in central europe far exceed legitimate defense need their presence be make more threatening still by a military doctrine that emphasize mobility and surprise attack and as history show these troop have build a legacy of intimidation and repression in response the nato ally must show they have the will and capacity to deter any conventional attack or any attempt to intimidate we yet we also will continue the search for responsible way to reduce nato and warsaw pact military personnel to equal level

 in recent week we in the alliance have consult on how good to invigorate the vienna negotiation on mutual and balanced force reductions base on these consultation western representative in the vienna talk soon will make a proposal by which the two alliance would reduce their respective ground force personnel in verifiable stage to a total of 700,000 man and their combined ground and air force personnel to a level of 900,000 man

 while the agreement would not eliminate the threat nor spare our citizen the task of maintain a substantial defense force it could constitute a major step toward a safe europe for both east and west it could lead to military stability at low level and lessen the danger of miscalculation and a surprise attack and it also would demonstrate the political will of the two alliance to enhance stability by limit their force in the central area of their military competition

 the west have establish a clear set of goal we as an alliance will press forward with plan to improve our own conventional force in europe at the same time we propose an arm control agreement to equalize conventional force at a significantly low level

 we will move ahead with our preparation to modernize our nuclear force in europe but again we also will work unceasingly to gain acceptance in geneva of our proposal to ban land base intermediate range nuclear missile

 in the united states we will move forward with the plan i announce last year to modernize our strategic nuclear force which play so vital a role in maintain peace by deter war yet we also have propose that strategic arms reductions talks begin we will pursue they determinedly

 in each of these area our policy be base on the conviction that a stable military balance at the low possible level will help further the cause of peace the other side will respond in good faith to these initiative only if it believe we be resolve to provide for our own defense unless convince that we will unite and stay united behind these arm control initiative and modernization program our adversary will seek to divide we from one another and our people from their leader

 i be optimistic about our relationship with the soviet union if the western nation remain true to their value and true to each other i believe in western civilization and its moral power i believe deeply in the principle the west esteem and guide by these ideal i believe we can find a no nonsense workable and last policy that will keep the peace

 early i say the german people have build a remarkable cathedral of democracy but we still have other work ahead we must build a cathedral of peace where nation be safe from war and where people need not fear for their liberty i have hear the history of the famous cathedral of cologne how those beautiful soar spire miraculously survive the destruction all around they include part of the church itself

 let we build a cathedral as the people of cologne build their with the deep commitment and determination let we build as they do not just for ourselves but for the generation beyond for if we construct our peace properly it will endure as long as the spire of cologne

 thank you very much



mr. secretary general mr. president distinguished delegate lady and gentleman

 i speak today as both a citizen of the united states and of the world i come with the heartfelt wish of my people for peace bear honest proposal and look for genuine progress

 dag hammarskjold say 24 year ago this month we meet in a time of peace which be no peace his word be as true today as they be then more than a hundred dispute have disturb the peace among nation since world war ii and today the threat of nuclear disaster hang over the life of all our people the bible tell we there will be a time for peace but so far this century mankind have fail to find it

 the united nations be dedicate to world peace and its charter clearly prohibit the international use of force yet the tide of belligerence continue to rise the charter 's influence have weaken even in the 4 year since the first special session on disarmament we must not only condemn aggression we must enforce the dictate of our charter and resume the struggle for peace

 the record of history be clear citizen of the united states resort to force reluctantly and only when they must our foreign policy as president eisenhower once say be not difficult to state we be for peace first last and always for very simple reason we know that only in a peaceful atmosphere a peace with justice one in which we can be confident can america prosper as we have know prosperity in the past he say

 he say to those who challenge the truth of those word let i point out at the end of world war ii we be the only undamaged industrial power in the world our military supremacy be unquestione we have harness the atom and have the ability to unleash its destructive force anywhere in the world in short we could have achieve world domination but that be contrary to the character of our people instead we write a new chapter in the history of mankind

 we use our power and wealth to rebuild the war ravage economy of the world both east and west include those nation who have be our enemy we take the initiative in create such international institution as this united nations where leader of good will could come together to build bridge for peace and prosperity

 america have no territorial ambition we occupy no country and we have build no wall to lock our people in our commitment to self determination freedom and peace be the very soul of america that commitment be as strong today as it ever be

 the united states have fight four war in my lifetime in each we struggle to defend freedom and democracy we be never the aggressor america 's strength and yes her military power have be a force for peace not conquest for democracy not despotism for freedom not tyranny watching as i have succeed generation of american youth blee their life onto far fling battlefield to protect our ideal and secure the rule of law i have know how important it be to deter conflict but since come to the presidency the enormity of the responsibility of this office have make my commitment even deeply i believe that responsibility be share by all of we here today

 on our recent trip to europe my wife nancy tell i of a bronze statue 22 foot high that she see on a cliff on the coast of france the beach at the base of the cliff be call saint laurent but countless american family bible have write it in on the flyleaf and know it as omaha beach the pastoral quiet of that french countryside be in mark contrast to the bloody violence that take place there on a june day 38 year ago when the allies storm the continent at the end of just one day of battle 10,500 americans be wound missing or kill in what became know as the normandy landing

 the statue atop that cliff be call the spirit of american youth rise from the wave its image of sacrifice be almost too powerful to describe

 the pain of war be still vivid in our national memory it send i to this special session of the united nations eager to comply with the plea of pope paul vi when he speak in this chamber nearly 17 year ago if you want to be brother his holiness say let the arm fall from your hand well we americans yearn to let they go but we need more than mere word more than empty promise before we can proceed

 we look around the world and see rampant conflict and aggression there be many source of this conflict expansionist ambition local rivalry the strive to obtain justice and security we must all work to resolve such discord by peaceful mean and to prevent they from escalation

 in the nuclear era the major power bear a special responsibility to ease these source of conflict and to refrain from aggression and that be why we be so deeply concerned by soviet conduct since world war ii the record of tyranny have include soviet violation of the yalta agreement lead to domination of eastern europe symbolize by the berlin wall a grim gray monument to repression that i visit just a week ago it include the takeover of czechoslovakia hungary and afghanistan and the ruthless repression of the proud people of poland soviet sponsor guerrilla and terrorist be at work in central and south america in africa the middle east in the caribbean and in europe violate human right and unnerve the world with violence communist atrocity in southeast asia afghanistan and elsewhere continue to shock the free world as refugee escape to tell of their horror

 the decade of so call detente witness the most massive soviet buildup of military power in history they increase their defense spending by 40 percent while american defense actually decline in the same real term soviet aggression and support for violence around the world have erode the confidence need for arm negotiation while we exercise unilateral restraint they forge ahead and today possess nuclear and conventional force far in excess of an adequate deterrent capability

 soviet oppression be not limit to the country they invade at the very time the soviet union be try to manipulate the peace movement in the west it be stifle a bud peace movement at home in moscow banner be scuttle button be snatch and demonstrator be arrest when even a few people dare to speak about their fear

 eleanor roosevelt one of our first ambassador to this body remind we that the high sound word of tyrant stand in bleak contradiction to their deed their promise she say be in deep contrast to their performance

 my country learn a bitter lesson in this century the scourge of tyranny can not be stop with word alone so we have embark on an effort to renew our strength that have fall dangerously low we refuse to become weak while potential adversary remain committed to their imperialist adventure

 my people have send i here today to speak for they as citizen of the world which they truly be for we americans be draw from every nationality represent in this chamber today we understand that man and woman of every race and creed can and must work together for peace we stand ready to take the next step down the road of cooperation through verifiable arm reduction

 agreement on arm control and disarmament can be useful in reinforce peace but they be not magic we should not confuse the signing of agreement with the solving of problem simply collect agreement will not bring peace agreement genuinely reinforce peace only when they be keep otherwise we be build a paper castle that will be blow away by the wind of war

 let i repeat we need deed not word to convince we of soviet sincerity should they choose to join we on this path

 since the end of world war ii the united states have be the leader in serious disarmament and arm control proposal in 1946 in what became know as the baruch plan the united states submit a proposal for control of nuclear weapon and nuclear energy by an international authority the soviets reject this plan in 1955 president eisenhower make his open skies proposal under which the united states and the soviet union would have exchange blueprint of military establishment and provide for aerial reconnaissance the soviets reject this plan

 in 1963 the limited test ban treaty come into force this treaty end nuclear weapon testing in the atmosphere outer space or under water by participate nation in 1970 the treaty on the non proliferation of nuclear weapons take effect the united states play a major role in this key effort to prevent the spread of nuclear explosive and to provide for international safeguard on civil nuclear activity

 my country remain deeply committed to those objective today and to strengthen the nonproliferation framework this be essential to international security in the early 1970 's again at united states urge agreement be reach between the united states and the u.s.s.r. provide for ceiling on some category of weapon they could have be more meaningful if soviet action have show restraint and commitment to stability at low level of force

 the united nations designate the 1970 's as the first disarmament decade but good intention be not enough in reality that 10 year period include an unprecedented buildup in military weapon and the flaring of aggression and use of force in almost every region of the world we be now in the second disarmament decade the task at hand be to assure civilized behavior among nation to unite behind an agenda of peace

 over the past 7 month the united states have put forward a broad base comprehensive series of proposal to reduce the risk of war we have propose four major point as an agenda for peace elimination of landbased intermediate range missile a onethird reduction in strategic ballistic missile warhead a substantial reduction in nato and warsaw pact ground and air force and new safeguard to reduce the risk of accidental war we urge the soviet union today to join with we in this quest we must act not for ourselves alone but for all mankind

 on november 18th of last year i announce united states objective in arm control agreement they must be equitable and militarily significant they must stabilize force at low level and they must be verifiable the united states and its ally have make specific reasonable and equitable proposal

 in february our negotiate team in geneva offer the soviet union a draft treaty on intermediate range nuclear force we offer to cancel deployment of our pershing ii ballistic missile and ground launch cruise missile in exchange for soviet elimination of the ss-20 ss-4 and ss-5 missile this proposal would eliminate with one stroke those system about which both side have express the great concern

 the united states be also look forward to begin negotiation on strategic arm reduction with the soviet union in less than 2 week we will work hard to make these talk an opportunity for real progress in our quest for peace

 on may 9th i announce a phase approach to the reduction of strategic arm in a first phase the number of ballistic missile warhead on each side would be reduce to about 5,000 no more than half the remain warhead would be on landbase missile all ballistic missile would be reduce to an equal level at about one half the current united states number in the second phase we would reduce each side 's overall destructive power to equal level include a mutual ceiling on ballistic missile throw weight below the current u.s. level we be also prepared to discuss other element of the strategic balance

 before i return from europe last week i meet in bonn with the leader of the north atlantic treaty organization we agree to introduce a major new western initiative for the vienna negotiation on mutual balanced force reductions our approach call for common collective ceiling for both nato and the warsaw treaty organization after 7 year there would be a total of 700,000 ground force and 900,000 ground and air force personnel combine it also include a package of associate measure to encourage cooperation and verify compliance

 we urge the soviet union and member of the warsaw pact to view our western proposal as a means to reach agreement in vienna after 9 long year of inconclusive talk we also urge they to implement the 1975 helsinki agreement on security and cooperation in europe

 let i stress that for agreement to work both side must be able to verify compliance the building of mutual confidence in compliance can only be achieve through great openness i encourage the special session on disarmament to endorse the importance of these principle in arm control agreement i have instruct our representative at the 40 nation committee on disarmament to renew emphasis on verification and compliance base on a u.s. proposal a committee have be form to examine these issue as they relate to restriction on nuclear testing

 we be also press the need for effective verification provision in agreement ban chemical weapon the use of chemical and biological weapon have long be view with revulsion by civilized nation no peacemaking institution can ignore the use of those dread weapon and still live up to its mission the need for a truly effective and verifiable chemical weapon agreement have be highlight by recent event the soviet union and their ally be violate the geneva protocol of 1925 relate rule of international law and the 1972 biological weapons convention there be conclusive evidence that the soviet government have provide toxin for use in laos and kampuchea and be themselves use chemical weapon against freedom fighter in afghanistan

 we have repeatedly protest to the soviet government as well as to the governments of laos and vietnam their use of chemical and toxin weapon we call upon they now to grant full and free access to their country or to territory they control so that united nations expert can conduct an effective independent investigation to verify cessation of these horror

 evidence of noncompliance with exist arm control agreement underscore the need to approach negotiation of any new agreement with care the democracy of the west be open society information on our defense be available to our citizen our elect official and the world we do not hesitate to inform potential adversary of our military force and ask in return for the same information concern theirs

 the amount and type of military spending by a country be important for the world to know as a measure of its intention and the threat that country may pose to its neighbor the soviet union and other closed society go to extraordinary length to hide their true military spending not only from other nation but from their own people this practice contribute to distrust and fear about their intention

 today the united states propose an international conference on military expenditure to build on the work of this body in develop a common system for accounting and reporting we urge the soviet union in particular to join this effort in good faith to revise the universally discredit official figure it publish and to join with we in give the world a true account of the resource we allocate to our armed force

 last friday in berlin i say that i would leave no stone unturned in the effort to reinforce peace and lessen the risk of war it be be clear to i step should be take to improve mutual communication confidence and lessen the likelihood of misinterpretation i have therefore direct the exploration of way to increase understanding and communication between the united states and the soviet union in time of peace and of crisis

 we will approach the soviet union with proposal for reciprocal exchange in such area as advance notification of major strategic exercise that otherwise might be misinterpret advance notification of icbm launch within as well as beyond national boundary and an expand exchange of strategic force datum

 while substantial information on u.s. activity and force in these area already be provide i believe that jointly and regularly share information would represent a qualitative improvement in the strategic nuclear environment and would help reduce the chance of misunderstanding i call upon the soviet union to join the united states in explore these possibility to build confidence and i ask for your support of our effort

 one of the major item before this conference be the development of a comprehensive program of disarmament we support the effort to chart a course of realistic and effective measure in the quest for peace

 i have come to this hall to call for international recommitment to the basic tenet of the united nations charter that all member practice tolerance and live together in peace as good neighbor under the rule of law forsake armed force as a means of settle dispute between nation america urge you to support the agenda for peace that i have outline today we ask you to reinforce the bilateral and multilateral arm control negotiation between member of nato and the warsaw pact and to rededicate yourself to maintain international peace and security and remove threat to peace

 we who have sign the u.n. charter have pledge to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territory or independence of any state in these time when more and more lawless act be go unpunished as some member of this very body show a grow disregard for the u.n. charter the peace love nation of the world must condemn aggression and pledge again to act in a way that be worthy of the ideal that we have endorse let we finally make the charter live

 in late spring 37 year ago representative of 50 nation gather on the other side of this continent in the san francisco opera house the league of nations have crumble and world war ii still rage but those man and nation be determined to find peace the result be this charter for peace that be the framework of the united nations

 president harry truman speak of the revival of an old faith he say the everlasting moral force of justice prompt that united nations conference such a force remain strong in america and in other country where speech be free and citizen have the right to gather and make their opinion know and president truman say if we should pay merely lip service to inspire ideal and later do violence to simple justice we would draw down upon we the bitter wrath of generation yet unborn those word of harry truman have special meaning for we today as we live with the potential to destroy civilization

 we must learn to live together in peace he say we must build a new world a far well world what a well world it would be if the gun be silent if neighbor no long encroach on neighbor and all people be free to reap the reward of their toil and determine their own destiny and system of government whatever their choice

 during my recent audience with his holiness pope john paul ii i give he the pledge of the american people to do everything possible for peace and arm reduction the american people believe forge real and last peace to be their sacred trust let we never forget that such a peace would be a terrible hoax if the world be no long bless with freedom and respect for human right

 the united nations hammarskjold say be bear out of the cataclysm of war it should justify the sacrifice of all those who have die for freedom and justice it be our duty to the past hammarskjold say and it be our duty to the future so to serve both our nation and the world

 as both patriot of our nation and the hope of all the world let those of we assemble here in the name of peace deepen our understanding renew our commitment to the rule of law and take new and bold step to calm an uneasy world can any delegate here deny that in so do he would be do what the people the rank and file of his own country or her own country want he or she to do be not it time for we to really represent the deep most heartfelt yearning of all of our people

 let no nation abuse this common longing to be free of fear we must not manipulate our people by play upon their nightmare we must serve mankind through genuine disarmament with god 's help we can secure life and freedom for generation to come

 thank you very much

my fellow americans

 there be an old saying we have all hear a thousand time about the weather and how everyone talk about it but no one do anything about it well many of you must be feel that way about the present state of our economy certainly there be a lot of talk about it but i want you to know we be do something about it and the reason i want to talk to you be because you can help we do something about it

 believe i if some of you be confused i can understand why for some time ever since we start plan the 1983 budget for the fiscal year begin this come october 1st there be be a steady drumbeat of report on what we be suppose to be do

 i know you have read and hear on the news a variety of statement attribute to various authoritative government source who prefer not to have their name use well you know my name and i think i be an authoritative source on this since i be right in the middle of what be go on here so i would like to set the record straight on a few of the thing that you might have hear lately

 i be sure you have hear that we be propose the large single tax increase in history the truth be we be propose nothing of the kind and then there be the one that our economic recovery program have fail so i have abandon it and turn to increase taxis instead of try to reduce federal spending well do not you believe that one either

 yes there be a tax bill before the congress tie to a program of further cut in spending it be not however the great single tax increase in history possibly it could be call the great tax reform in history but it absolutely do not represent any reversal of policy or philosophy on the part of this administration or this president

 now you may have hear that some special interest oppose this bill and that be right some do as a matter of fact some in the congress of my own party object to this bill and strongly i be tell by many that this bill be not politically popular and it may not be why then do i support it i support it because it be right for america i support it because it be fair i support it because it will when combine with our cut in government spending reduce interest rate and put more americans back to work again

 now you will recall that when our administration come into office a year ago last january we announce a plan for economic recovery recovery from what from a 1980 recession that see inflation in double digit figure for the second year in a row it be 12.4 percent when we arrive interest rate have go into outer space they be at the high they would be in a hundred year with a prime rate that hit 21 percent there be almost 8 million americans out of work and in several hard hit industrial states there already be pocket of unemployment reach figure of 15 18 and even 20 percent i go to those area i know

 the cost of government be increase at a rate of 17 percent a year there be little we could do about the budget already in place but we could do something about the one that have be propose for the fiscal year begin in october of our first year

 i would campaign on the belief that government cost should be reduce and that the percentage of the people 's earning take by government in taxis should also be reduce i also say that one area of government spending could not be reduce but must instead be increase that be the spending necessary to restore our nation 's defense which have be allow to deteriorate to a dangerous degree in the precede 4 year

 interest rate continue high as the month go by and unemployment increase particularly in the automobile industry and housing construction few could or would afford the high interest rate for home mortgage or installment buying of an automobile

 meantime we be put our economic recovery program in place it be not easy we do not get all the cut we want and we get some tax measure we do not want but we be chart a complete turnaround in government policy and we do get the major part of what we propose the congress mandate spending cut of $ 130 billion over 3 year and adopt the big tax cut in history

 now this too be to be implement over a 3 year period it begin with a 5 percent cut in the personal income tax begin october 1st 1981 then a 10 percent cut this last july and another schedule for july 1st 1983 these will be follow by indexing of the tax bracket so worker get cost of living pay raise will not be move up into high bracket we have to realize inflation itself be a tax government profit by inflation but indexing will put a stop to that

 there be tax cut for business and industry to help provide capital for modernization of plant and equipment change in the estate tax capital gain tax and the marriage penalty tax some who support we on the spending cut be fearful about cut taxis in view of the continue budget deficit we feel that tax cut have to be a part of our plan in order to provide incentive for individual and for business to increase productivity and thus create job for the unemployed

 now it be only be ten month since the first phase of our program go into effect as i say early there be those who say it be be try and it fail well as al smith use to say let us look at the record

 start with interest rate the basic cause of the present recession the prime rate be as i say 21 1/2 percent well last week it be 14 1/2 percent and as of today three major bank have lower it to 14 percent last week 90 day treasury bill be pay less than 9 percent interest one year ago they be pay 15 1/2 that double digit inflation 12.4 percent have be cut in half for the last 6 month real earning be at last increase for the first time in quite a long time personal saving which trend downward throughout the last decade be increase this mean more money in the pool of investment capital this will help far reduce interest rate

 all of this in only 10 month hardly look like a program that fail to i oh yes i fail to mention that in the quarter just end there be an increase in economic growth the first such increase in a long time

 our big problem the last one to be solve in every recession be unemployment i understand how tough it be for those who be wait for the job that come with recovery we can have no rest until our neighbor our fellow citizen who want to work be able once again to find job again let i say the main obstacle to their do so be continue high interest rate

 those rate should be low now than they be with the success we have have in reduce inflation but part of the problem be psychological a pessimism in the money market that we will not stay the course and continue lower the cost of government the project increase in budget deficit have add to that pessimism and fear and this bring we back to that so call great tax increase in history and the budget proposal now before the congress

 when i submit the 1983 budget to the congress in february it contain very significant spending cut on top of those we obtain last year this time however we could not get the support we have last year some who have not be happy about the tax cut then be now insist we must have additional tax revenue in fact they want to cancel the reduction schedule for next july and cancel the indexing of tax bracket other propose tax increase mount to about $ 150 billion over a 3 year period on top of this there be resistance to the spending reduction we ask for and even attempt to eliminate some of last year 's cut so as to actually increase spending

 for many month now we have be work to get a compromise budget that would far reduce spending and thus reduce the deficit we also have stand firm on retain the tax cut already in place because as i say they be essential to restore the economy

 we do however agree to limited revenue increase so long as they do not harm the incentive feature of our economic recovery program we ourselves last year have call attention to the possibility of well compliance with the tax law collect taxis legitimately owe but which be not be pay

 well week and week of negotiation result in a congressional budget resolution combine revenue increase and further spending reduction revenue would increase over a 3 year period by about $ 99 billion and outlay in that same period would be reduce by 280 billion now as you can see that figure out to about a 3 to-1 ratio—$3 less in spend outlay for each $ 1 of increase revenue

 this compromise add up to a total over three year of a $ 380 billion reduction in the budget deficit and remember our original tax reduction remain in place which mean your taxis will still be cut $ 335 billion in these next three year even with the passage of this present tax bill

 now let i take that $ 99 billion tax program apart and you decide whether it be the big tax increase in history of the entire $ 99 billion 32 billion be collection of tax presently owe under the present law and which be not be pay now to all of you who be pay your tax simple fairness say we should collect from those who be freeload roughly 48 billion of the 99 billion represent close off special interest loophole which have result in unintended tax advantage for some not all taxpayer some who be financially well able to pay their share now this be also a matter of simple fairness so more than 80 percent of the tax bill be not new tax at all but be well collect and correcting of flaw in the system

 now this leave $ 19 billion over three year of actual new taxis which be far outweigh by the tax cut which will benefit individual there be an excise tax on cigarette another on telephone well for people who smoke a pack a day that tax will mean an increase of only $ 2.40 a month the telephone tax increase be only about 54 cent a month for the average household right now the tax reduction that we pass last year be save the average family about $ 400 per year next year even after this new tax bill be pass the saving will almost double they will go to $ 788

 and here be what the total look like the new tax reform will raise in 3 year about as i say 99 billion in the same 3 year as i say a moment ago our tax cut program even after this increase will save you 335 billion

 within the new bill there have of course be disagreement over some of the specific provision for example there be considerable confusion over the proposal to have withholding of tax due on interest and dividend just as it be withhold now on your wage and salary many senior citizen have be lead to believe this be a new tax add on top of the present income tax well there be no truth whatsoever to that we find that while the overwhelming majority of americans faithfully report income from interest and dividend and pay taxis on it some do not it be one of the significant area of noncompliance and be cost the government about $ 9 billion a year

 in the case of those over age 65 withholding will only apply to those with income of $ 14,450 and up per individual and $ 24,214 for couple file a joint return low income citizen below 65 will be exempt if their income be less than about $ 8,000 for an individual or 15,300 for those file joint return and there will be an exemption for all interest payment of $ 150 or less the only people whose taxis will be increase by this withholding be those who presently be evade their fair share of the tax burden once again we be strive to see that all taxpayer be treat fairly

 now this withholding will go into effect next july not this january 1st as be early report back during the campaign n september 9th 1980 to be exact i say my goal be to reduce by 1985 the share of the gross national product take by the government in taxis reduce it to 20.5 percent if we have do nothing it would have rise to almost 25 percent but even after passage of this bill the federal government in 1985 will only be take 19.6 percent of the gross national product

 make no mistake about it this whole package be a compromise i have to swallow hard to agree to any revenue increase but there be two side to a compromise those who support the increase revenue swallow hard to accept $ 280 billion in outlay cut other have accept specific provision with regard to taxis or spending cut which they oppose there be a provision in the bill for extended unemployment payment in states particularly hard hit by unemployment if this provision be not enact 2 million unemployed people will use up their benefit by the end of march

 i repeat much of this bill will make our tax system more fair for every american especially those in low income bracket i be still dedicated to reduce the level of spending until it be within our income and i still want to see the base of the economy broaden so that the individual 's tax burden can be far reduce

 over the year growth in government and deficit spending have be build into our system now it would be nice if we could just cut that out of our system with a single sharp slice that however can not be do without bring great hardship down on many of our less fortunate neighbor who be not in a position to provide for themselves and none of we want that

 our effort to restore fiscal integrity and common sense to the federal establishment be not limit to the budget cut and tax policy vice president bush head up a task force that be be review excessive regulation already enough unnecessary and duplicative regulation have be eliminate or revise to save an estimate $ 6 billion every year

 our inspectors general have be mobilize into a task force aim at ferret out waste and fraud they have conduct ten of thousand of audit secure thousand of indictment result in many conviction in the first 6 month of fiscal 1982 alone they find $ 5.8 billion of saving and improved use of fund computer cross checking have uncover thousand of government check still go to people who have be dead for several year

 task force from the private sector be engage in a study of the management structure of government what they have learn already indicate a great potential for saving by simply bring government procedure up to ordinary modern business standard our private sector initiative force under william verity have uncover hundred of community and statewide project perform service voluntarily that once be think to be the province of government some of the most innovative have to do with job training and placement particularly for young people

 what we need now be an end to the bickering here in the capital we need the bipartisan comprehensive package of revenue increase and spending cut now before the congress we need it to be pass

 we be not propose a quick fix an artificial stimulant to the economy such as we have see in the several recession in recent year the present recession be bottom out without resort to quick fix

 now there will not be a sudden boom or upsurge but slowly and surely we will have a sound and lasting recovery base on solid value and increase productivity and an end to deficit spending it may not be easy but it be the good way the only way to real and last prosperity for all our people

 think of it we have only have one balanced budget in the last 20 year let us look forward to the day when we begin make payment to reduce the national debt instead of turn it all over to our child

 you help we start this economic recovery program last year when you tell your representative you want it you can help again whether you be a republican a democrat or an independent by let they know that you want it continue let they know that you understand that this legislation be a price worth pay for low interest rate economic recovery and more job

 the single most important question face we tonight be do we reduce deficit and interest rate by raise revenue from those who be not now pay their fair share or do we accept big budget deficit high interest rate and high unemployment simply because we disagree on certain feature of a legislative package which offer hope for million of americans at home on the farm and in the workplace

 do we tell these americans to give up hope that their ship of state lie dead in the water because those entrust with man that ship can not agree on which sail to raise we be within sight of the safe port of economic recovery do we make port or go aground on the shoal of selfishness partisanship and just plain bullheadedness

 the measure the congress be about to vote on while not perfect in the eye of any one of we will bring we close to the goal of a balanced budget restore industrial power and employment for all who want to work together we can reach that goal

 thank you god bless you





my fellow americans

 today have be a day that should make we proud it mark the end of the successful evacuation of plo from beirut lebanon this peaceful step could never have be take without the good office of the united states and especially the truly heroic work of a great american diplomat ambassador philip habib

 thank to his effort i be happy to announce that the u.s. marine contingent help to supervise the evacuation have accomplish its mission our young man should be out of lebanon within 2 week they too have serve the cause of peace with distinction and we can all be very proud of they

 but the situation in lebanon be only part of the overall problem of conflict in the middle east so over the past 2 week while event in beirut dominate the front page america be engage in a quiet behind the scene effort to lay the groundwork for a broad peace in the region for once there be no premature leak as u.s. diplomatic mission travel to mideast capital and i meet here at home with a wide range of expert to map out an american peace initiative for the long suffer people of the middle east arab and israeli alike

 it seem to i that with the agreement in lebanon we have an opportunity for a more far reach peace effort in the region and i be determined to seize that moment in the word of the scripture the time have come to follow after the thing which make for peace tonight i want to report to you the step we have take and the prospect they can open up for a just and last peace in the middle east

 america have long be commit to bring peace to this troubled region for more than a generation successive united states administration have endeavor to develop a fair and workable process that could lead to a true and lasting arab israeli peace

 our involvement in the search for mideast peace be not a matter of preference it be a moral imperative the strategic importance of the region to the united states be well know but our policy be motivate by more than strategic interest we also have an irreversible commitment to the survival and territorial integrity of friendly state nor can we ignore the fact that the well being of much of the world 's economy be tie to stability in the strife tear middle east finally our traditional humanitarian concern dictate a continue effort to peacefully resolve conflict

 when our administration assume office in january of 1981 i decide that the general framework for our middle east policy should follow the broad guideline lay down by my predecessor there be two basic issue we have to address first there be the strategic threat to the region pose by the soviet union and its surrogate well demonstrate by the brutal war in afghanistan and second the peace process between israel and its arab neighbor

 with regard to the soviet threat we have strengthen our effort to develop with our friend and ally a joint policy to deter the soviets and their surrogate from further expansion in the region and if necessary to defend against it

 with respect to the arab israeli conflict we have embrace the camp david framework as the only way to proceed we have also recognize however solve the arab israeli conflict in and of itself can not assure peace throughout a region as vast and troubled as the middle east

 our first objective under the camp david process be to ensure the successful fulfillment of the egyptian israeli peace treaty this be achieve with the peaceful return of the sinai to egypt in april 1982 to accomplish this we work hard with our egyptian and israeli friend and eventually with other friendly country to create the multinational force which now operate in the sinai throughout this period of difficult and time consume negotiation we never lose sight of the next step of camp david autonomy talk to pave the way for permit the palestinian people to exercise their legitimate right however owe to the tragic assassination of president sadat and other crisis in the area it be not until january 1982 that we be able to make a major effort to renew these talk

 secretary of state haig and ambassador fairbanks make three visit to israel and egypt early this year to pursue the autonomy talk considerable progress be make in develop the basic outline of an american approach which be to be present to egypt and israel after april

 the successful completion of israel 's withdrawal from sinai and the courage show on this occasion by prime minister begin and president mubarak in live up to their agreement convince i the time have come for a new american policy to try to bridge the remain difference between egypt and israel on the autonomy process so in may 1 call for specific measure and a timetable for consultation with the government of egypt and israel on the next step in the peace process however before this effort could be launch the conflict in lebanon preempt our effort

 the autonomy talk be basically put on hold while we seek to untangle the party in lebanon and still the gun of war the lebanon war tragic as it be have leave we with a new opportunity for middle east peace we must seize it now and bring peace to this troubled area so vital to world stability while there be still time it be with this strong conviction that over a month ago before the present negotiation in beirut have be complete i direct secretary of state shultz to again review our policy and to consult a wide range of outstanding americans on the good way to strengthen chance for peace in the middle east

 we have consult with many of the official who be historically involve in the process with member of the congress and with individual from the private sector and i have hold extensive consultation with my own adviser on the principle that i will outline to you tonight

 the evacuation of the plo from beirut be now complete and we can now help the lebanese to rebuild their war tear country we owe it to ourselves and to posterity to move quickly to build upon this achievement a stable and revive lebanon be essential to all our hope for peace in the region the people of lebanon deserve the good effort of the international community to turn the nightmare of the past several year into a new dawn of hope but the opportunity for peace in the middle east do not begin and end in lebanon as we help lebanon rebuild we must also move to resolve the root cause of conflict between arabs and israelis

 the war in lebanon have demonstrate many thing but two consequence be key to the peace process first the military loss of the plo have not diminish the yearning of the palestinian people for a just solution of their claim and second while israel 's military success in lebanon have demonstrate that its armed force be second to none in the region they alone can not bring just and last peace to israel and her neighbor

 the question now be how to reconcile israel 's legitimate security concern with the legitimate right of the palestinians and that answer can only come at the negotiating table each party must recognize that the outcome must be acceptable to all and that true peace will require compromise by all

 so tonight i be call for a fresh start this be the moment for all those directly concerned to get involve or lend their support to a workable basis for peace the camp david agreement remain the foundation of our policy its language provide all party with the leeway they need for successful negotiation

 i call on israel to make clear that the security for which she yearn can only be achieve through genuine peace a peace require magnanimity vision and courage

 i call on the palestinian people to recognize that their own political aspiration be inextricably bind to recognition of israel 's right to a secure future

 and i call on the arab states to accept the reality of israel and the reality that peace and justice be to be gain only through hard fair direct negotiation

 in make these call upon other i recognize that the united states have a special responsibility no other nation be in a position to deal with the key party to the conflict on the basis of trust and reliability

 the time have come for a new realism on the part of all the people of the middle east the state of israel be an accomplished fact it deserve unchallenged legitimacy within the community of nation but israel 's legitimacy have thus far be recognize by too few country and have be deny by every arab state except egypt israel exist it have a right to exist in peace behind secure and defensible border and it have a right to demand of its neighbor that they recognize those fact

 i have personally follow and support israel 's heroic struggle for survival ever since the founding of the state of israel 34 year ago in the pre-1967 border israel be barely 10 mile wide at its narrow point the bulk of israel 's population live within artillery range of hostile arab army i be not about to ask israel to live that way again

 the war in lebanon have demonstrate another reality in the region the departure of the palestinians from beirut dramatize more than ever the homelessness of the palestinian people palestinians feel strongly that their cause be more than a question of refugee i agree the camp david agreement recognize that fact when it speak of the legitimate right of the palestinian people and their just requirement

 for peace to endure it must involve all those who have be most deeply affect by the conflict only through broad participation in the peace process most immediately by jordan and by the palestinians will israel be able to rest confident in the knowledge that its security and integrity will be respect by its neighbor only through the process of negotiation can all the nation of the middle east achieve a secure peace

 these then be our general goal what be the specific new american position and why be we take they in the camp david talk thus far both israel and egypt have feel free to express openly their view as to what the outcome should be understandably their view have differ on many point the united states have thus far seek to play the role of mediator we have avoid public comment on the key issue we have always recognize and continue to recognize that only the voluntary agreement of those party most directly involve in the conflict can provide an endure solution but it be become evident to i that some clear sense of america 's position on the key issue be necessary to encourage wide support for the peace process

 first as outline in the camp david accord there must be a period of time during which the palestinian inhabitant of the west bank and gaza will have full autonomy over their own affair due consideration must be give to the principle of self government by the inhabitant of the territory and to the legitimate security concern of the party involve the purpose of the 5 year period of transition which would begin after free election for a self govern palestinian authority be to prove to the palestinians that they can run their own affair and that such palestinian autonomy pose no threat to israel 's security

 the united states will not support the use of any additional land for the purpose of settlement during the transitional period indeed the immediate adoption of a settlement freeze by israel more than any other action could create the confidence need for wide participation in these talk further settlement activity be in no way necessary for the security of israel and only diminish the confidence of the arabs that a final outcome can be freely and fairly negotiate

 i want to make the american position well understand the purpose of this transitional period be the peaceful and orderly transfer of authority from israel to the palestinian inhabitant of the west bank and gaza at the same time such a transfer must not interfere with israel 's security requirement

 beyond the transition period as we look to the future of the west bank and gaza it be clear to i that peace can not be achieve by the formation of an independent palestinian state in those territory nor be it achievable on the basis of israeli sovereignty or permanent control over the west bank and gaza so the united states will not support the establishment of an independent palestinian state in the west bank and gaza and we will not support annexation or permanent control by israel

 there be however another way to peace the final status of these land must of course be reach through the give and take of negotiation but it be the firm view of the united states that self government by the palestinians of the west bank and gaza in association with jordan offer the good chance for a durable just and last peace we base our approach squarely on the principle that the arab israeli conflict should be resolve through negotiation involve an exchange of territory for peace

 this exchange be enshrine in united nations security council resolution 242 which be in turn incorporate in all its part in the camp david agreement u.n. resolution 242 remain wholly valid as the foundation stone of america 's middle east peace effort it be the united states position that in return for peace the withdrawal provision of resolution 242 apply to all front include the west bank and gaza when the border be negotiate between jordan and israel our view on the extent to which israel should be ask to give up territory will be heavily affect by the extent of true peace and normalization and the security arrangement offer in return

 finally we remain convinced that jerusalem must remain undivided but its final status should be decide through negotiation

 in the course of the negotiation to come the united states will support position that seem to we fair and reasonable compromise and likely to promote a sound agreement we will also put forward our own detailed proposal when we believe they can be helpful and make no mistake the united states will oppose any proposal from any party and at any point in the negotiating process that threaten the security of israel america 's commitment to the security of israel be ironclad and i might add so be mine

 during the past few day our ambassadors in israel egypt jordan and saudi arabia have present to their host government the proposal in full detail that i have outline here today now i be convinced that these proposal can bring justice bring security and bring durability to an arab israeli peace the united states will stand by these principle with total dedication they be fully consistent with israel 's security requirement and the aspiration of the palestinians

 we will work hard to broaden participation at the peace table as envisage by the camp david accord and i fervently hope that the palestinians and jordan with the support of their arab colleague will accept this opportunity

 tragic turmoil in the middle east run back to the dawn of history in our modern day conflict after conflict have take its brutal toll there in an age of nuclear challenge and economic interdependence such conflict be a threat to all the people of the world not just the middle east itself it be time for we all in the middle east and around the world to call a halt to conflict hatred and prejudice it be time for we all to launch a common effort for reconstruction peace and progress

 it have often be say and regrettably too often be true that the story of the search for peace and justice in the middle east be a tragedy of opportunity miss in the aftermath of the settlement in lebanon we now face an opportunity for a broad peace this time we must not let it slip from our grasp we must look beyond the difficulty and obstacle of the present and move with a fairness and resolve toward a bright future we owe it to ourselves and to posterity to do no less for if we miss this chance to make a fresh start we may look back on this moment from some late vantage point and realize how much that failure cost we all

 these then be the principle upon which american policy toward the arab israeli conflict will be base i have make a personal commitment to see that they endure and god willing that they will come to be see by all reasonable compassionate people as fair achievable and in the interest of all who wish to see peace in the middle east

 tonight on the eve of what can be a dawning of new hope for the people of the troubled middle east and for all the world 's people who dream of a just and peaceful future i ask you my fellow americans for your support and your prayer in this great undertaking

 thank you and god bless you





my fellow americans

 the scene that the whole world witness this past weekend be among the most heart rend in the long nightmare of lebanon 's agony million of we have see picture of the palestinian victim of this tragedy there be little that word can add but there be action we can and must take to bring that nightmare to an end

 it be not enough for we to view this as some remote event in which we ourselves be not involve for our friend in lebanon and israel for our friend in europe and elsewhere in the middle east and for we as americans this tragedy horrible as it be remind we of the absolute imperative of bring peace to that troubled country and region by work for peace in the middle east we serve the cause of world peace and the future of mankind

 for the criminal who do this deed no punishment be enough to remove the blot of their crime but for the rest of we there be thing that we can learn and thing that we must do the people of lebanon must have learn that the cycle of massacre upon massacre must end child be not avenge by the murder of other child israel must have learn that there be no way it can impose its own solution on hatred as deep and bitter as those that produce this tragedy if it seek to do so it will only sink more deeply into the quagmire that loom before it those outsider who have feed the flame of civil war in lebanon for so many year need to learn that the fire will consume they too if it be not put out and we must all rededicate ourselves to the cause of peace i reemphasize my call for early progress to solve the palestinian issue and repeat the u.s. proposal which be now even more urgent

 for now be not the time for talk alone now be a time for action to act together to restore peace to beirut to help a stable government emerge that can restore peace and independence to all of lebanon and to bring a just and last resolution to the conflict between israel and its arab neighbor one that satisfy the legitimate right of the palestinians who be all too often its victim

 our basic objective in lebanon have not change for they be the objective of the government and the people of lebanon themselves first and foremost we seek the restoration of a strong and stable central government in that country bring into be by orderly constitutional process lebanon elect a new president 2 short week ago only to see he murder even before he could assume his office this week a distressed lebanon will again be elect a new president may god grant he safety as well as the wisdom and courage to lead his country into a new and happy era

 the international community have an obligation to assist the government of lebanon in reassert authority over all its territory foreign force and armed faction have too long obstruct the legitimate role of the government of lebanon 's security force we must pave the way for withdrawal of foreign force

 the place to begin this task be in beirut the lebanese government must be permit to restore internal security in its capital it can not do this if foreign force remain in or near beirut with this goal in mind i have consult with our french and italian ally we have agree to form a new multinational force similar to the one which serve so well last month with the mission of enable the lebanese government to resume full sovereignty over its capital the essential precondition for extend its control over the entire country

 the lebanese government with the support of its people request this help for this multinational force to succeed it be essential that israel withdraw from beirut with the expect cooperation of all party the multinational force will return to beirut for a limited period of time its purpose be not to act as a police force but to make it possible for the lawful authority of lebanon to discharge those duty for themselves

 secretary shultz on my behalf have also reiterate our view to the government of israel through its ambassador in washington unless israel move quickly and courageously to withdraw it will find itself ever more deeply involve in problem that be not its own and which it can not solve

 the participation of american force in beirut will again be for a limited period but i have conclude there be no alternative to their return to lebanon if that country be to have a chance to stand on its own foot

 peace in beirut be only a first step together with the people of lebanon we seek the removal of all foreign military force from that country the departure of all foreign force at the request of the lebanese authority have be widely endorse by arab as well as other state israel and syria have both indicate that they have no territorial ambition in lebanon and be prepared to withdraw it be now urgent that specific arrangement for withdrawal of all foreign force be agree upon this must happen very soon the legitimate security concern of neighboring state include particularly the safety of israel 's northern population must be provide for but this be not a difficult task if the political will be there the lebanese people must be allow to chart their own future they must rely solely on lebanese armed forces who be willing and able to bring security to their country they must be allow to do so and the soon the well

 ambassador draper who be be in close consultation with the party concern in lebanon will remain in the area to work for the full implementation of our proposal ambassador habib will join he will represent i at the inauguration of the new president of lebanon and will consult with the leader in the area he will return promptly to washington to report to i

 early in the summer our government meet its responsibility to help resolve a severe crisis and to relieve the lebanese people of a crush burden we succeed recent event have produce new problem and we must again assume our responsibility

 i be especially anxious to end the agony of lebanon because it be both right and in our national interest but i be also determined to press ahead on the broad effort to achieve peace between israel and its arab neighbor the event in beirut of last week have serve only to reinforce my conviction that such a peace be desperately need and that the initiative we undertake on september 1st be the right way to proceed we will not be discourage or deter in our effort to seek peace in lebanon and a just and last peace throughout the middle east

 all of we must learn the appropriate lesson from this tragedy and assume the responsibility that it impose upon we we owe it to ourselves and to our child the whole world will be a safe place when this region which have know so much trouble can begin to know peace instead both our purpose and our action be peaceful and we be take they in a spirit of international cooperation

 so tonight i ask for your prayer and your support as our country continue its vital role as a leader for world peace a role that all of we as americans can be proud of thank you and god bless you

mr. speaker mr. president distinguished members of the congress honored guest and fellow citizen

 this solemn occasion mark the 196th time that a president of the united states have report on the state of the union since george washington first do so in 1790 that be a lot of report but there be no shortage of new thing to say about the state of the union the very key to our success have be our ability foremost among nation to preserve our last value by make change work for we rather than against we

 i would like to talk with you this evening about what we can do together not as republicans and democrats but as americans to make tomorrow 's america happy and prosperous at home strong and respected abroad and at peace in the world

 as we gather here tonight the state of our union be strong but our economy be troubled for too many of our fellow citizen farmer steel and auto worker lumberman black teenager work mother this be a painful period we must all do everything in our power to bring their ordeal to an end it have fall to we in our time to undo damage that be a long time in the making and to begin the hard but necessary task of build a well future for ourselves and our child

 we have a long way to go but thank to the courage patience and strength of our people america be on the mend

 but let i give you just one important reason why i believe this it involve many member of this body

 just 10 day ago after month of debate and deadlock the bipartisan commission on social security accomplish the seemingly impossible social security as some of we have warn for so long face disaster i myself have be talk about this problem for almost 30 year as 1983 begin the system stand on the brink of bankruptcy a double victim of our economic ill first a decade of rampant inflation drain its reserve as we try to protect beneficiary from the spiral cost of living then the recession and the sudden end of inflation wither the expand wage base and increase revenue the system need to support the 36 million americans who depend on it

 when the speaker of the house the senate majority leader and i perform the bipartisan or form the bipartisan commission on social security pundit and expert predict that party division and conflict interest would prevent the commission from agree on a plan to save social security well sometimes even here in washington the cynic be wrong through compromise and cooperation the member of the commission overcome their difference and achieve a fair workable plan they prove that when it come to the national welfare americans can still pull together for the common good

 tonight i be especially pleased to join with the speaker and the senate majority leader in urge the congress to enact this plan by easter

 there be element in it of course that none of we prefer but take together it perform a package that all of we can support it ask for some sacrifice by all the self employ beneficiary worker government employee and the well off among the retired but it impose an undue burden on none and in support it we keep an important pledge to the american people the integrity of the social security system will be preserve and no one 's payment will be reduce

 the commission 's plan will do the job indeed it must do the job we owe it to today 's old americans and today 's young worker so before we go any far i ask you to join with i in salute the member of the commission who be here tonight and senate majority leader howard baker and speaker tip o'neill for a job well do i hope and pray the bipartisan spirit that guide you in this endeavor will inspire all of we as we face the challenge of the year ahead

 nearly half a century ago in this chamber another american president franklin delano roosevelt in his second state of the union message urge america to look to the future to meet the challenge of change and the need for leadership that look forward not backward

 throughout the world he say change be the order of the day in every nation economic problem long in the making have bring crisis to of many kind for which the master of old practice and theory be unprepared he also remind we that the future lie with those wise political leader who realize that the great public be interested more in government than in politic

 so let we in these next two year man and woman of both party every political shade concentrate on the long range bipartisan responsibility of government not the short range or short term temptation of partisan politic

 the problem we inherit be far bad than most inside and out of government have expect the recession be deep than most inside and out of government have predict cure those problem have take more time and a high toll than any of we want unemployment be far too high project federal spending if government refuse to tighten its own belt will also be far too high and could weaken and shorten the economic recovery now underway

 this recovery will bring with it a revival of economic confidence and spending for consumer item and capital good the stimulus we need to restart our stall economic engine the american people have already step up their rate of saving assure that the fund need to modernize our factory and improve our technology will once again flow to business and industry

 the inflationary expectation that lead to a 21 1/2 percent interest prime rate and soar mortgage rate 2 year ago be now reduce by almost half leader have start to realize that double digit inflation be no long a way of life i misspoke there i should have say lender

 so interest rate have tumble pave the way for recovery in vital industry like housing and auto

 the early evidence of that recovery have start come in housing start for the fourth quarter of 1982 be up 45 percent from a year ago and housing permit a sure indicator of future growth be up a whopping 60 percent

 we be witness an upsurge of productivity and impressive evidence that american industry will once again become competitive in market at home and abroad ensure more job and well income for the nation 's work force but our confidence must also be temper by realism and patience quick fix and artificial stimulant repeatedly apply over decade be what bring we the inflationary disorder that we have now pay such a heavy price to cure

 the permanent recovery in employment production and investment we seek will not come in a sharp short spurt it will build carefully and steadily in the month and year ahead in the meantime the challenge of government be to identify the thing that we can do now to ease the massive economic transition for the american people

 the federal budget be both a symptom and a cause of our economic problem unless we reduce the dangerous growth rate in government spending we could face the prospect of sluggish economic growth into the indefinite future failure to cope with this problem now could mean as much as a trillion dollar more in national debt in the next four year alone that would average $ 4,300 in additional debt for every man woman child and baby in our nation

 to assure a sustained recovery we must continue get runaway spending under control to bring those deficit down if we do not the recovery will be too short unemployment will remain too high and we will leave an unconscionable burden of national debt for our child that we must not do

 let us be clear about where the deficit problem come from contrary to the drumbeat we have be hear for the last few month the deficit we face be not root in defense spending take as a percentage of the gross national product our defense spending happen to be only about four fifth of what it be in 1970 nor be the deficit as some would have it root in tax cut even with our tax cut taxis as a fraction of gross national product remain about the same as they be in 1970 the fact be our deficit come from the uncontrolled growth of the budget for domestic spending

 during the 1970 's the share of our national income devote to this domestic spending increase by more than 60 percent from 10 cent out of every dollar produce by the american people to 16 cent in spite of all our economy and efficiency and without add any new program basic necessary domestic spending provide for in this year 's budget will grow to almost a trillion dollar over the next 5 year

 the deficit problem be a clear and present danger to the basic health of our republic we need a plan to overcome this danger a plan base on these principle it must be bipartisan conquer the deficit and put the government 's house in order will require the good effort of all of we it must be fair just as all will share in the benefit that will come from recovery all would share fairly in the burden of transition it must be prudent the strength of our national defense must be restore so that we can pursue prosperity and peace and freedom while maintain our commitment to the truly needy and finally it must be realistic we can not rely on hope alone

 with these guide principle in mind let i outline a four part plan to increase economic growth and reduce deficit

 first in my budget message i will recommend a federal spending freeze i know this be strong medicine but so far we have only cut the rate of increase in federal spending the government have continue to spend more money each year though not as much more as it do in the past take as a whole the budget i be propose for the fiscal year will increase no more than the rate of inflation in other word the federal government will hold the line on real spending now that be far less than many american family have have to do in these difficult time

 i will request that the propose 6 month freeze in cost of living adjustment recommend by the bipartisan social security commission be apply to other government relate retirement program i will also propose a 1 year freeze on a broad range of domestic spending program and for federal civilian and military pay and pension program and let i say right here i be sorry with regard to the military in ask that of they because for so many year they have be so far behind and so low in reward for what the man and woman in uniform be do but i be sure they will understand that this must be across the board and fair

 second i will ask the congress to adopt specific measure to control the growth of the so call uncontrollable spending program these be the automatic spending program such as food stamp that can not be simply freeze and that have grow by over 400 percent since 1970 they be the large single cause of the build in or structural deficit problem our standard here will be fairness ensure that the taxpayer hard earn dollar go only to the truly needy that none of they be turn away but that fraud and waste be stamp out and i be sorry to say there be a lot of it out there in the food stamp program alone last year we identify almost $ 1.1 billion in overpayment the taxpayer be not the only victim of this kind of abuse the truly needy suffer as fund intend for they be take not by the needy but by the greedy for everyone 's sake we must put an end to such waste and corruption

 third i will adjust our program to restore america 's defense by propose $ 55 billion in defense saving over the next 5 year these be saving recommend to i by the secretary of defense who have assure i they can be safely achieve and will not diminish our ability to negotiate arm reduction or endanger america 's security we will not gamble with our national survival

 and fourth because we must ensure reduction and eventual elimination of deficit over the next several year i will propose a standby tax limit to no more than 1 percent of the gross national product to start in fiscal 1986 it would last no more than 3 year and it would start only if the congress have first approve our spending freeze and budget control program and there be several other condition also that must be meet all of they in order for this program to be trigger

 now you could say that this be an insurance policy for the future a remedy that will be at hand if need but only resort to if absolutely necessary in the meantime we will continue to study way to simplify the tax code and make it more fair for all americans this be a goal that every american who be ever struggle with a tax form can understand

 at the same time however i will oppose any effort to undo the basic tax reform that we have already enact include the 10 percent tax break come to taxpayer this july and the tax indexing which will protect all americans from inflationary bracket creep in the year ahead

 now i realize that this four part plan be easy to describe than it will be to enact but the loom deficit that hang over we and over america 's future must be reduce the path i have outline be fair balanced and realistic if enact it will ensure a steady decline in deficit aim toward a balanced budget by the end of the decade it be the only path that will lead to a strong sustained recovery let we follow that path together

 no domestic challenge be more crucial than provide stable permanent job for all americans who want to work the recovery program will provide job for most but other will need special help and training for new skill shortly i will submit to the congress the employment act of 1983 design to get at the special problem of the long term unemployed as well as young people try to enter the job market i will propose extend unemployment benefit include special incentive to employer who hire the long term unemployed provide program for displace worker and help federally fund and state administer unemployment insurance program provide worker with training and relocation assistance finally our proposal will include new incentive for summer youth employment to help young people get a start in the job market

 we must offer both short term help and long term hope for our unemployed i hope we can work together on this i hope we can work together as we do last year in enact the landmark job training partnership act regulatory reform legislation a responsible clean air act and passage of enterprise zone legislation will also create new incentive for job and opportunity

 one of out of every five job in our country depend on trade so i will propose a broad strategy in the field of international trade one that increase the openness of our trading system and be fair to america 's farmer and worker in the world marketplace we must have adequate export financing to sell american product overseas i will ask for new negotiating authority to remove barrier and to get more of our product into foreign market we must strengthen the organization of our trade agency and make change in our domestic law and international trade policy to promote free trade and the increase flow of american good service and investment

 our trade position can also be improve by make our port system more efficient well more active harbor translate into stable job in our coalfield railroad trucking industry and port after 2 year of debate it be time for we to get together and enact a port modernization bill

 education training and retraining be fundamental to our success as be research and development and productivity labor management and government at all level can and must participate in improve these tool of growth tax policy regulatory practice and government program all need constant reevaluation in term of our competitiveness every american have a role and a stake in international trade

 we americans be still the technological leader in most field we must keep that edge and to do so we need to begin renew the basic start with our educational system while we grow complacent other have act japan with a population only about half the size of ours graduate from its university more engineer than we do if a child do not receive adequate math and science teaching by the age of 16 he or she have lose the chance to be a scientist or an engineer we must join together parent teacher grass root group organize labor and the business community to revitalize american education by set a standard of excellence

 in 1983 we seek four major education goal a quality education initiative to encourage a substantial upgrading of math and science instruction through block grant to the states establishment of education saving account that will give middle and low income family an incentive to save for their child 's college education and at the same time encourage a real increase in saving for economic growth passage of tuition tax credit for parent who want to send their child to private or religiously affiliate school a constitutional amendment to permit voluntary school prayer god should never have be expel from america 's classroom in the first place

 also in the area of fairness and equity we will ask for extension of the civil rights commission which be due to expire this year the commission be an important part of the ongoing struggle for justice in america and we strongly support its reauthorization effective enforcement of our nation 's fair housing law be also essential to ensure equal opportunity in the year ahead we will work to strengthen enforcement of fair housing law for all americans

 the time have also come for major reform of our criminal justice statute and acceleration of the drive against organized crime and drug trafficking it be high time that we make our city safe again this administration hereby declare an all out war on big time organize crime and the drug racketeer who be poison our young people we will also implement recommendation of our task force on victims of crime which will report to i this week

 american agriculture the envy of the world have become the victim of its own success with one farmer now produce enough food to feed himself and 77 other people america be confront with record surplus crop and commodity price below the cost of production we must strive through innovation like the payment in kind crop swap approach and an aggressive export policy to restore health and vitality to rural america meanwhile i have instruct the department of agriculture to work individually with farmer with debt problem to help they through these tough time

 over the past year our task force on private sector initiatives have successfully forge a work partnership involve leader of business labor education and government to address the training need of american worker thank to the task force private sector initiative be now underway in all 50 state of the union and thousand of work people have be help in make the shift from dead end job and low demand skill to the growth area of high technology and the service economy additionally a major effort will be focus on encourage the expansion of private community child care the new advisory council on private sector initiative will carry on and extend this vital work of encourage private initiative in 1983

 during the next several week i will send to the congress a series of detailed proposal on these and other topic and look forward to work with you on the development of these initiative

 so far now i have concentrate mainly on the problem pose by the future but in almost every home and workplace in america we be already witness reason for great hope the first flowering of the manmade miracle of high technology a field pioneer and still lead by our country

 to many of we now computer silicon chip datum processing cybernetic and all the other innovation of the dawn high technology age be as mystify as the working of the combustion engine must have be when that first model t rattle down main street u.s.a. but as surely as america 's pioneer spirit make we the industrial giant of the 20th century the same pioneer spirit today be open up on another vast front of opportunity the frontier of high technology

 in conquer the frontier we can not write off our traditional industry but we must develop the skill and industry that will make we a pioneer of tomorrow this administration be commit to keep america the technological leader of the world now and into the 21st century

 but let we turn briefly to the international arena america 's leadership in the world come to we because of our own strength and because of the value which guide we as a society free election a free press freedom of religious choice free trade union and above all freedom for the individual and rejection of the arbitrary power of the state these value be the bedrock of our strength they unite we in a stewardship of peace and freedom with our ally and friend in nato in asia in latin america and elsewhere they be also the value which in the recent past some among we have begin to doubt and view with a cynical eye

 fortunately we and our ally have rediscover the strength of our common democratic value and we be apply they as a cornerstone of a comprehensive strategy for peace with freedom in london last year i announce the commitment of the united states to develop the infrastructure of democracy throughout the world we intend to pursue this democratic initiative vigorously the future belong not to government and ideology which oppress their people but to democratic system of self government which encourage individual initiative and guarantee personal freedom

 but our strategy for peace with freedom must also be base on strength economic strength and military strength a strong american economy be essential to the well being and security of our friend and ally the restoration of a strong healthy american economy have be and remain one of the central pillar of our foreign policy the progress i have be able to report to you tonight will i know be as warmly welcome by the rest of the world as it be by the american people

 we must also recognize that our own economic well being be inextricably link to the world economy we export over 20 percent of our industrial production and 40 percent of our farmland produce for export we will continue to work closely with the industrialize democracy of europe and japan and with the international monetary fund to ensure it have adequate resource to help bring the world economy back to strong noninflationary growth

 as the leader of the west and as a country that have become great and rich because of economic freedom america must be an unrelenting advocate of free trade as some nation be tempt to turn to protectionism our strategy can not be to follow they but to lead the way toward free trade to this end in may of this year america will host an economic summit meeting in williamsburg virginia

 as we begin our third year we have put in place a defense program that redeem the neglect of the past decade we have develop a realistic military strategy to deter threat to peace and to protect freedom if deterrence fail our armed forces be finally properly pay after year of neglect be well train and become well equip and supply and the american uniform be once again wear with pride most of the major system need for modernize our defense be already underway and we will be address one key system the mx missile in consultation with the congress in a few month

 america 's foreign policy be once again base on bipartisanship on realism strength full partnership in consultation with our ally and constructive negotiation with potential adversary from the middle east to southern africa to geneva american diplomat be take the initiative to make peace and low arm level we should be proud of our role as peacemaker

 in the middle east last year the united states play the major role in end the tragic fighting in lebanon and negotiate the withdrawal of the plo from beirut

 last september i outline principle to carry on the peace process begin so promisingly at camp david all the people of the middle east should know that in the year ahead we will not flag in our effort to build on that foundation to bring they the blessing of peace

 in central america and the caribbean basin we be likewise engage in a partnership for peace prosperity and democracy final passage of the remain portion of our caribbean basin initiative which pass the house last year be one of this administration 's top legislative priority for 1983

 the security and economic assistance policy of this administration in latin america and elsewhere be base on realism and represent a critical investment in the future of the human race this undertaking be a joint responsibility of the executive and legislative branch and i be count on the cooperation and statesmanship of the congress to help we meet this essential foreign policy goal

 at the heart of our strategy for peace be our relationship with the soviet union the past year see a change in soviet leadership we be prepared for a positive change in soviet american relation but the soviet union must show by deed as well as word a sincere commitment to respect the right and sovereignty of the family of nation responsible member of the world community do not threaten or invade their neighbor and they restrain their ally from aggression

 for our part we be vigorously pursue arm reduction negotiation with the soviet union support by our ally we have put forward draft agreement propose significant weapon reduction to equal and verifiable low level we insist on an equal balance of force and give the overwhelming evidence of soviet violation of international treaty concern chemical and biological weapon we also insist that any agreement we sign can and will be verifiable

 in the case of intermediate range nuclear force we have propose the complete elimination of the entire class of land base missile we be also prepared to carefully explore serious soviet proposal at the same time let i emphasize that ally steadfastness remain a key to achieve arm reduction

 with firmness and dedication we will continue to negotiate deep down the soviets must know it be in their interest as well as our to prevent a wasteful arm race and once they recognize our unshakable resolve to maintain adequate deterrence they will have every reason to join we in the search for great security and major arm reduction when that moment come and i be confident that it will we will have take an important step toward a more peaceful future for all the world 's people

 a very wise man bernard baruch once say that america have never forget the nobler thing that bring she into being and that light her path our country be a special place because we americans have always be sustain through good time and bad by a noble vision a vision not only of what the world around we be today but what we as a free people can make it be tomorrow

 we be realist we solve our problem instead of ignore they no matter how loud the chorus of despair around we but we be also idealist for it be an ideal that bring our ancestor to these shore from every corner of the world

 right now we need both realism and idealism million of our neighbor be without work it be up to we to see they be not without hope this be a task for all of we and may i say americans have rally to this cause prove once again that we be the most generous people on earth

 we who be in government must take the lead in restore the economy applause and here all that time i think you be read the paper laughter

 the single thing the single thing that can start the wheel of industry turn again be further reduction of interest rate just another 1 or 2 point can mean ten of thousand of job

 right now with inflation as low as it be 3.9 percent there be room for interest rate to come down only fear prevent their reduction a lender as we know must charge an interest rate that recover the depreciate value of the dollar loan and that depreciation be of course the amount of inflation today interest rate be base on fear fear that government will resort to measure as it have in the past that will send inflation zoom again

 we who serve here in this capital must erase that fear by make it absolutely clear that we will not stop fight inflation that together we will do only those thing that will lead to last economic growth

 yes the problem confront we be large and forbidding and certainly no one can or should minimize the plight of million of our friend and neighbor who be live in the bleak emptiness of unemployment but we must and can give they good reason to be hopeful

 back over the year citizen like ourselves have gather within these wall when our nation be threaten sometimes when its very existence be at stake always with courage and common sense they meet the crisis of their time and live to see a strong well and more prosperous country the present situation be no bad and in fact be not as bad as some of those they face time and again they prove that there be nothing we americans can not achieve as free man and woman

 yes we still have problem plenty of they but it be just plain wrong unjust to our country and unjust to our people to let those problem stand in the way of the most important truth of all america be on the mend

 we owe it to the unfortunate to be aware of their plight and to help they in every way we can no one can quarrel with that we must and do have compassion for all the victim of this economic crisis but the big story about america today be the way that million of confident care people those extraordinary ordinary americans who never make the headline and will never be interview be lay the foundation not just for recovery from our present problem but for a well tomorrow for all our people

 from coast to coast on the job and in classroom and laboratory at new construction site and in church and community group neighbor be help neighbor and they have already begin the building the research the work and the giving that will make our country great again

 i believe this because i believe in they in the strength of their heart and mind in the commitment that each one of they bring to their daily life be they high or humble the challenge for we in government be to be worthy of they to make government a help not a hindrance to our people in the challenging but promising day ahead

 if we do that if we care what our child and our child 's child will say of we if we want they one day to be thankful for what we do here in these temple of freedom we will work together to make america well for our having be here not just in this year or this decade but in the next century and beyond

 thank you and god bless you





lady and gentleman mr. chairman reverend clergy mickey i thank you very much for those very kind word and i thank all of you for certainly a most hearty and warm welcome

 i be grateful to the american conservative union young americans for freedom national review and human events for organize this third annual memorial service for the democratic platform of 1980 someone ask i why i want to make it three in a row well you know how the irish love wake

 but i be delighted to be back here with you at your 10th annual conference in my last two address i have talk about our common perception and goal and i think i might report to you here tonight on where we stand in achieve those goal a sort of state of the reagan report if you will

 now i be the first to acknowledge that there be a good deal leave unfinished on the conservative agenda our cleanup crew will need more than 2 year to deal with the mess leave by other for over half a century but i be not dishearten in fact my attitude about that unfinished agenda be not very different from that express in an anecdote about one of my favorite president calvin coolidge

 some of you may know that after cal coolidge be introduce to the sport of fishing by his secret service detail it get to be quite a passion with he if you can use that word about silent cal anyway he be once ask by reporter how many fish be in one of his favorite angling place the river brule and coolidge say the water be estimate to carry 45,000 trout and then he say i have not catch they all yet but i sure have intimidate they

 well it be true we have not bring about every change important to the conscience of a conservative but we conservative can take a great deal of honest pride in what we have achieve in a few minute i want to talk about just how far we have come and what we need to do to win further victory but right now i think a word or two on strategy be in order you may remember that in the past i mention that it be not our task as conservative to just point out the mistake make over all the decade of liberal government not just to form an able opposition but to govern to lead a nation and i note this would make new demand upon our movement upon all of we for the first time in half a century we have develop a whole new cadre of young conservative in government we have show that conservative can do more than criticize we have show that we can govern and move our legislation through the congress

 now i know there ' concern over attempt to roll back some of the gain that we have make and it seem to i that here we ought to give some thought to strategy to make sure that we stop and think before we act for example some of our critic have be say recently that they want to take back the people 's third year tax cut and abolish tax indexing and some other include member of my staff want immediately to open up a verbal barrage against they well i hope you know that sometimes it be well if a president do not say exactly what be on his mind there be an old story about a farmer and a lawyer that illustrate my point

 it seem that these two get into a pretty bad collision a traffic accident they both get out of their car the farmer take one look at the lawyer walk back to his car get a package bring it back there be a bottle inside and he say here you look pretty shake up i think you ought to take a nip of this it will steady your nerve well the lawyer do and the farmer say you still look a little bit pale how about another and the lawyer take another swallow and under the urging of the farmer he take another and another and another and then finally he say he be feel pretty good and ask the farmer if he do not think that he ought to have a little nip too and the farmer say not i i be wait for the state trooper

 i wonder if we can not learn something from that farmer if our liberal friend really want to head into the next election under the banner of take away from the american people their first real tax cut in nearly 20 year if after peer into their heart of heart they feel they must tell the american people that over the next 6 year they want to reduce the income of an average family by $ 3,000 and if they want to voice these deeply hold conviction in an election year well fellow conservative who be we to stifle the voice of conscience

 now in talk about our legislative agenda i know that some of you have be disturb by the notion of standby tax increase in the so call out year well i be not wild about the idea myself but the economy be get well and i believe these improvement be only the beginning and with some luck and if the american people respond with the kind of energy and initiative they have always show in the past well maybe it be time we start think about some standby tax cut too

 but you know the great thing about that standby tax increase be that if it be pass they can not put it into effect unless they have first agree to all our spending cut it do give they something to think about

 but you know with regard to the economy i wonder if our political adversary have not once again prove that they be our good ally they spend the last 16 month or so place all the responsibility for the state of the economy on our shoulder and with some help from the medium it be be a pretty impressive campaign they have create quite an image we're responsible for the economy

 well i assume that we be responsible then for inflation which after back to back year in double digit before we get here have now be reduce to 3.9 percent in 1982 and for the last 3 month of that year it run at only 1.1 percent in 1982 real wage increase for the first time in 3 year interest rate as you have already be tell have drop dramatically with the prime rate shrink by nearly 50 percent and in december the index of lead indicator be a full 6.3 percent above last march 's low point and have rise in 8 of the last 9 month last month housing start be up 95 percent and building permit 88 percent over last year at this time new home sale be up by 54 percent since april and inventory of unsold home be at the low level in more than a decade auto production this quarter be schedule to increase by 22 percent and general motors alone be put 21,400 of their worker back on the job last month 's sharp decline in the unemployment rate be the most heartening sign of all it would have take a $ 5 billion job bill to reduce unemployment by the same amount and it do not cost we anything

 it be time to admit our guilt time we admit that our liberal critic have be right all the time and they should go right on tell the american people that the state of the economy be precisely the fault of that wicked creature kemp roth and its havoc break truth reaganomics

 let us confess let us admit that we have turn the corner on the economy and we be especially proud of one thing when we hit heavy weather we do not panic we do not go for fast bromide and quick fix the huge tax increase or wage and price control recommend by so many and our stubbornness if you want to call it that will quite literally pay off for every american in the year ahead

 so let i pledge to you tonight carefully we have set out on the road to recovery we will not be deter we will not be turn back i reject the policy of the past the policy of tax and tax spend and spend elect and elect the lesson of these fail policy be clear i have say this before you can not drink yourself sober or spend yourself rich and you can not prime the pump without pump the prime as somebody do like to 21 percent in 1980

 and a word be in order here on the most historic of all the legislative reform we have achieve in the last 2 year that of tax indexing you can understand the terror that strike in the heart of those whose principal constituency be big government bracket creep be government 's hide incentive to inflate the currency and bring on inflation and indexing will end that it will end those huge hide subsidy for big and big government in the future if we get indexing plant firmly as a law of the land the advocate of big government who want money more money for their social spending their social engineering scheme will have to go to the people and say right out loud we want more money from your weekly paycheck so we be raise your taxis do that instead of sneak it out by way of inflation which they have help bring on

 so all the professional washingtonians from bureaucrat to lobbyist to the special interest group be frightened plain scared and they be work overtime to take this one back well i think i speak for all conservative when i say tax indexing be nonnegotiable it be a fight we will take to the people and we will win

 but i think you can see how even this debate show thing be change for the well it highlight the essential difference between two philosophy now contend for power in american political life one be the philosophy of the past a philosophy that have as its constituent an ill assorted mix of elitist and special interest group who see government as the principal vehicle of social change who believe that the only thing we have to fear be the people who must be watch and regulate and superintend from washington

 on the other hand our political philosophy be at the heart of the new political consensus that emerge in america at the beginning of this decade one that i believe all well i believe it will dominate american politic for many decade the economic disaster bring about by too much government be the catalyst for this consensus during the seventy the american people begin to see misdirect overgrown government as the source of many of our social problem not the solution

 this new consensus have a view of government that be essentially that of our founding father that government be the servant not the master that it be mean to maintain order to protect our nation 's safety but otherwise in the word of that note political philosopher schnozzle jimmy durante do not put no constriction on da people leave them da heck alone

 the override goal during the past 2 year have be to give the government back to the american people to make it responsive again to their wish and desire to do more than bring about a healthy economy or a grow gross national product we have truly bring about a quiet revolution in american government

 for too many year bureaucratic self interest and political maneuvering hold sway over efficiency and honesty in government federal dollar be treat as the property of bureaucrat not taxpayer those in the federal establishment who point to the misuse of those dollar be look upon as malcontent or troublemaker

 well this administration have break with what be a kind of a buddy system there have be dramatic turnabout in some of the more scandal ridden and wasteful federal agency and program only a few year ago the general services administration be rack by indictment and report after report of inefficiency and waste today at gsa jerry carmen have not only put the whistle blower back in charge he be promote they and give they new responsibility just listen to this little set of figure today general services administration work in progress time be down from 30 day to 7 even while the agency have sustain budget cut of 20 percent office space reduction of 20 percent and the attrition of 7,000 employee

 at the government printing office under dan sawyer loss of million of dollar have suddenly be end as the workforce be cut through attrition and a hire freeze and overtime pay be cut by $ 6 million in 1 year alone the government publication program which run a cumulative loss of $ 20 million over a 3 year period register a $ 4.9 million profit and the gpo as a whole have experience a profit of $ 4.1 million last year

 it be say by some that this administration have turn a blind eye to waste and fraud at the pentagon while overzealously concentrate on the social program well at the pentagon under cap weinberger 's leadership and our superb service secretary jack marsh john lehman and verne orr we have identify more than a billion dollar in saving on waste and fraud and over the next 7 year multiyear procurement and other acquisition initiative will save we almost $ 30 billion

 now these be only three example of what we be attempt to do to make government more efficient the list go on we have wield our inspector general as a strike force account for nearly $ 17 billion in saving in 18 month with peter grace 's help we have call on top management executive and expert from the private sector to suggest modern management technique for every aspect of government operation and with an exciting new project call reform 88 we be go to streamline and reorganize the process that control the money information personnel and property of the federal bureaucracy the maze through which nearly $ 2 trillion pass each year and which include 350 different payroll system and 1,750 personnel office

 there be more much more from cut down wasteful travel practice to reduce paperwork from aggressively pursue the $ 40 billion in bad debt owe the federal government to reduce publication of more than 70 million copy of wasteful or unnecessary government publication

 but you know make government responsive again to the people involve more than eliminate waste and fraud and inefficiency during the decade when government be intrude into area where it be neither competent nor need it be also ignore its legitimate and constitutional duty such as preserve the domestic peace and provide for the common defense

 i will talk about defense in a moment i know you have already hear about that today some of you but on the matter of domestic order a few thing need to be say first of all it be abundantly clear that much of our crime problem be provoke by a social philosophy that see man as primarily a creature of his material environment the same liberal philosophy that see an era of prosperity and virtue usher in by change man 's environment through massive federal spending program also view criminal as the unfortunate product of poor socioeconomic condition or an underprivileged upbringing society not the individual they say be at fault for criminal wrongdoing we be to blame

 well today a new political consensus utterly reject this point of view the american people demand that government exercise its legitimate and constitutional duty to punish career criminal those who consciously choose to make their life by prey on the innocent

 now we conservative have be warn about the crime problem for many year about that permissive social philosophy that do so much to foster it about a legal system that seem to specialize in let hardened criminal go free and now we have the mean and the power to do something let us get to work

 drugpusher after drugpusher mobster after mobster have escape justice by take advantage of our flawed bail and parole system criminal who have commit atrocious act have cynically utilize the technicality of the exclusionary rule a miscarriage of justice unique to our legal system indeed one national institute of justice study show that of those arrest for drug felony in los angeles county in 1981 32 percent be back out on the street because of perceive problem with the exclusionary rule

 now the exclusionary rule that be not a law that be pass by congress or a state legislature it be what be call case law the result of judicial decision if a law enforcement officer obtain evidence as the result of a violation of the law regard search and seizure that evidence can not be introduce in a trial even if it prove the guilt of the accuse now this be hardly punishment of the officer for his violation of legal procedure and it be only effect in many case be to free someone patently guilty of a crime

 i do not know maybe i have tell you this before but i have to give you a glaring example of what i have take too much time to explain here san bernardino california several year ago two narcotic agent base on the evidence that they have obtain a legal warrant to search a home of a man and woman suspect of peddle heroin they search the home they do not find anything but as they be leave just on a hunch they turn back to the baby in the crib and take down the diaper and there be the stash of heroin the evidence be throw out of court and the couple go free because the baby have not give permission for the violation of its constitutional right

 well this administration have propose vital reform of our bail and parole system and criminal forfeiture and sentencing statute these reform be pass by the senate 95 to 1 last year our anticrime package never get out of committee in the house of representatives do you see a target there the american people want these reform and they want they now i be ask tonight that you mobilize all the powerful resource of this political movement to get these measure pass by the congress

 on another front all of you know how vitally important it be for we to reverse the decline in american education to take responsibility for the education of our child out of the hand of the bureaucrat and put it back in the hand of parent and teacher that be why the congress must stop dither we need those tuition tax credit we need a voucher system for the parent of disadvantaged child we need education saving account a sort of ira for college and finally and do not think for a moment i have give up we need to eliminate that unnecessary and politically engender department of education

 there be other step we be take to restore government to its rightful duty to restore the political consensus upon which this nation be found our founding fathers prohibit a federal establishment of religion but there be no evidence that they intend to set up a wall of separation between the state and religious belief itself

 the evidence of this be all around we in the declaration of independence alone there be no few than four mention of a supreme being in god we trust be engrave on our coinage the supreme court open its proceeding with a religious invocation and the congress open each day with prayer from its chaplain the schoolchildren of the united states be entitle to the same privilege as supreme court justices and congressmen join i in persuade the congress to accede to the overwhelming desire of the american people for a constitutional amendment permit prayer in our school

 and finally on our domestic agenda there be a subject that weigh heavily on all of we the tragedy of abortion on demand this be a grave moral evil and one that require the full discussion on the floor of the house and senate as we see in the last century with the issue of slavery any attempt by the congress to stifle or compromise away discussion of important moral issue only far inflame emotion on both side and lead ultimately to even more social disruption and disunity

 so tonight i would ask that the congress discuss the issue of abortion openly and freely on the floor of the house and senate let those who believe the practice of abortion to be a moral evil join we in take this case to our fellow americans and let we do so rationally calmly and with an honest regard for our fellow americans

 speak for myself i believe that once the implication of abortion on demand be fully air and understand by the american people they will resolutely seek its abolition now i know there be many who sincerely believe that limit the right of abortion violate the freedom of choice of the individual but if the unborn child be a live entity then there be two individual each with the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness unless and until someone can prove the unborn be not alive and all medical evidence indicate it be then we must concede the benefit of the doubt to the unborn infant

 but whether it be cut spending and tax shrink the size of the deficit end overregulation inefficiency fraud and waste in government crack down on career criminal revitalize american education press for prayer and abortion legislation i think you can see that the agenda we have put before america these past 2 year have be a conservative one oh and there be two other matter that i think you would be interested in first as part of our federalism effort next week we will be send to the congress our proposal for four megablock grant that will return vital prerogative to the states where they belong and second the office of management and budget will press ahead with new regulation prohibit the use of federal tax dollar for purpose of political advocacy

 and these important domestic initiative have be complement by the conservative idea we have bring to the pursuit of foreign policy in the struggle now go on for the world we have not be afraid to characterize our adversary for what they be we have focus world attention on force labor on the soviet pipeline and soviet repression in poland and all the other nation that make up what be call the fourth world"—those live under totalitarian rule who long for freedom

 we publicize the evidence of chemical warfare and other atrocity in cambodia which we be now suppose to call kampuchea and in afghanistan we point out that totalitarian power hold a radically different view of morality and human dignity than we do we must develop a forward strategy for freedom one base on our hope that someday representative government will be enjoy by all the people and all the nation of the earth

 we have be strive to give the world the fact about the international arm race ever since our nearly total demobilization after world war ii we in the west have be play catchup yes there be be an international arm race as some of the declare democratic candidate for the presidency tell we but let they also tell we there be only be one side do the racing

 those of you in the frontline of the conservative movement can be of special assistance in further our strategy for freedom our fight against totalitarianism first of all there be no more important foreign policy initiative in this administration and none that frighten our adversary more than our attempt through our international radio to build constituency for peace in nation dominate by totalitarian militaristic regime we have propose to the congress modest but vitally important expenditure for the voice of america radio free europe radio liberty and radio marti these proposal stall last year but with your help we can get they through the congress this year and believe i nothing could mean more to the poles lithuanians cubans and all the million of other live in that fourth world

 now it would be also unconscionable during any discussion of the need for candor in our foreign policy not to mention here the tragic event that last year shock the world the attack on his holiness pope john paul ii an act of unspeakable evil an assault on man and god it be an international outrage and merit the full possible investigation tonight i want to take this opportunity to applaud the courage and resourcefulness of the government of italy in bring this matter to the attention of the world and contrary to what some have suggest you can depend on it there be no one on our side that be act embarrassed or feel embarrassed because they be go ahead with that investigation we mean to help they

 and now cap you can breathe easy because here we come we must continue to revitalize and strengthen our armed forces cap weinberger 's be wage an heroic 's battle on this front i be ask you the conservative leader here tonight to make support for our defense buildup one of your top priority

 but besides progress in further all of these item on the conservative agenda something else be occur something that someday we conservative may be very proud happen under our leadership even with all our recent economic hardship i believe a feeling of optimism be now enter the american consciousness a belief that the day of division and discord be behind we and that an era of unity and national renewal be upon we

 a vivid reminder of how our nation have learn and grow and transcend the tragedy of the past be give to we here in washington only a few month ago last november on the mall between the lincoln memorial and the washington monument a new memorial be dedicate one of dark low lie wall inscribe with the name of those who give their life in the vietnam conflict soon there will be add a sculpture of three infantryman represent different racial and ethnic background

 during the dedication ceremony the roll of the missing and dead be read for 3 day morning till night in a candlelight ceremony at the national cathedral and those veteran of vietnam who be never welcome home with speech and band but who be undefeated in battle and be hero as surely as any who ever fight in a noble cause stage their own parade on constitution avenue

 as america watch they some in wheelchair all of they proud there be a feeling that as a nation we be come together come together again and that we have at long last bring the boy home

 a lot of healing go on say jan scruggs the wound combat veteran who helped organize support for the memorial and then there be this newspaper account that appear after the ceremony i would like to read it to you

 yesterday crowd return to the memorial among they be herbie petit a machinist and former marine from new orleans last night he say stand near the wall i go out to dinner with some ex marine there be also a group of college student in the restaurant we start talk to each other and before we leave they stand up and cheer the whole week petit say his eye red it be worth it just for that

 it have be worth it we americans have learn again to listen to each other to trust each other we have learn that government owe the people an explanation and need their support for its action at home and abroad and we have learn and i pray this time for good that we must never again send our young man to fight and die in conflict that our leader be not prepared to win thank you very much

 yet the most valuable lesson of all the preciousness of human freedom have be relearn not just by americans but all the people of the world it be the stark lesson that truongs nhu tang one of the founder of the national liberation front a former viet cong minister and vice minister of the postwar vietnamese communist government speak of recently when he explain why he flee vietnam for freedom no previous regime in my country he write about the concentration camp and boat people of vietnam bring such number of people to such desperation not the military dictator not the colonialist not even the ancient chinese warlord it be a lesson that my compatriot and i learn through witness and through suffer in our own life the fate of our countryman it be a lesson that must eventually move the conscience of the world this man who have fight on the other side learn the value of freedom only after help to destroy it and see those who have have to give it up

 the task that have fall to we as americans be to move the conscience of the world to keep alive the hope and dream of freedom for if we fail or falter there will be no place for the world 's oppress to flee to this be not a role we seek we preach no manifest destiny but like the americans who bring a new nation into the world 200 year ago history have ask much of we in our time much we have already give much more we must be prepare to give

 this be not a task we shrink from it be a task we welcome for with the privilege of live in this kindly pleasant green land call america this land of generous spirit and great ideal there be also a destiny and a duty a duty to preserve and hold in sacred trust mankind 's age old aspiration of peace and freedom and a well life for generation to come

 god bless you all and thank you for what you be do





reverend clergy all senator hawkins distinguished member of the florida congressional delegation and all of you

 i can not tell you how you have warm my heart with your welcome i be delighted to be here today

 those of you in the national association of evangelicals be know for your spiritual and humanitarian work and i would be especially remiss if i do not discharge right now one personal debt of gratitude thank you for your prayer nancy and i have feel their presence many time in many way and believe i for we they have make all the difference

 the other day in the east room of the white house at a meeting there someone ask i whether i be aware of all the people out there who be pray for the president and i have to say yes i be i have feel it i believe in intercessionary prayer but i could not help but say to that questioner after he have ask the question that or at least say to they that if sometime when he be pray he get a busy signal it be just i in there ahead of he laughter i think i understand how abraham lincoln feel when he say i have be drive many time to my knee by the overwhelming conviction that i have nowhere else to go

 from the joy and the good feeling of this conference i go to a political reception laughter now i do not know why but that bit of scheduling remind i of a story—[laughter]—which i will share with you

 an evangelical minister and a politician arrive at heaven 's gate one day together and st. peter after do all the necessary formality take they in hand to show they where their quarter would be and he take they to a small single room with a bed a chair and a table and say this be for the clergyman and the politician be a little worried about what might be in store for he and he could not believe it then when st. peter stop in front of a beautiful mansion with lovely ground many servant and tell he that these would be his quarter

 and he could not help but ask he say but wait how there be something wrong how do i get this mansion while that good and holy man only get a single room and st. peter say you have to understand how thing be up here we have get thousand and thousand of clergy you be the first politician who ever make it laughter

 but i do not want to contribute to a stereotype laughter so i tell you there be a great many god fear dedicated noble man and woman in public life present company include and yes we need your help to keep we ever mindful of the idea and the principle that bring we into the public arena in the first place the basis of those ideal and principle be a commitment to freedom and personal liberty that itself be ground in the much deep realization that freedom prosper only where the blessing of god be avidly seek and humbly accept

 the american experiment in democracy rest on this insight its discovery be the great triumph of our founding father voice by william penn when he say if we will not be govern by god we must be govern by tyrant explain the inalienable right of man jefferson say the god who give we life give we liberty at the same time and it be george washington who say that of all the disposition and habit which lead to political prosperity religion and morality be indispensable support

 and finally that shrewdest of all observer of american democracy alexis de tocqueville put it eloquently after he have go on a search for the secret of america 's greatness and genius and he say not until i go into the church of america and hear her pulpit aflame with righteousness do i understand the greatness and the genius of america america be good and if america ever cease to be good america will cease to be great

 well i be pleased to be here today with you who be keep america great by keep she good only through your work and prayer and those of million of other can we hope to survive this perilous century and keep alive this experiment in liberty this last good hope of man

 i want you to know that this administration be motivate by a political philosophy that see the greatness of america in you her people and in your family church neighborhood community the institution that foster and nourish value like concern for other and respect for the rule of law under god

 now i do not have to tell you that this put we in opposition to or at least out of step with a prevailing attitude of many who have turn to a modern day secularism discard the tried and time test value upon which our very civilization be base no matter how well intentione their value system be radically different from that of most americans and while they proclaim that they be free we from superstition of the past they have take upon themselves the job of superintend we by government rule and regulation sometimes their voice be loud than our but they be not yet a majority

 an example of that vocal superiority be evident in a controversy now go on in washington and since i be involve i have be wait to hear from the parent of young america how far be they willing to go in give to government their prerogative as parent

 let i state the case as briefly and simply as i can an organization of citizen sincerely motivated and deeply concerned about the increase in illegitimate birth and abortion involve girl well below the age of consent sometime ago establish a nationwide network of clinic to offer help to these girl and hopefully alleviate this situation now again let i say i do not fault their intent however in their well intentione effort these clinic have decide to provide advice and birth control drug and device to underage girl without the knowledge of their parent

 for some year now the federal government have help with fund to subsidize these clinic in provide for this the congress decreed that every effort would be make to maximize parental participation nevertheless the drug and device be prescribe without get parental consent or give notification after they have do so girl term sexually active"—and that have replace the word promiscuous"—are give this help in order to prevent illegitimate birth or abortion

 well we have order clinic receive federal fund to notify the parent such help have be give one of the nation 's lead newspaper have create the term squeal rule in editorializing against we for do this and we be be criticize for violate the privacy of young people a judge have recently grant an injunction against an enforcement of our rule i have watch tv panel show discuss this issue see columnist pontificate on our error but no one seem to mention morality as play a part in the subject of sex

 be all of judeo christian tradition wrong be we to believe that something so sacred can be look upon as a purely physical thing with no potential for emotional and psychological harm and be not it the parent right to give counsel and advice to keep their child from make mistake that may affect their entire life

 many of we in government would like to know what parent think about this intrusion in their family by government we be go to fight in the court the right of parent and the right of family take precedence over those of washington base bureaucrat and social engineer

 but the fight against parental notification be really only one example of many attempt to water down traditional value and even abrogate the original term of american democracy freedom prosper when religion be vibrant and the rule of law under god be acknowledge when our founding fathers pass the first amendment they seek to protect church from government interference they never intend to construct a wall of hostility between government and the concept of religious belief itself

 the evidence of this permeate our history and our government the declaration of independence mention the supreme be no less than four time in god we trust be engrave on our coinage the supreme court open its proceeding with a religious invocation and the member of congress open their session with a prayer i just happen to believe the schoolchildren of the united states be entitle to the same privilege as supreme court justices and congressman

 last year i send the congress a constitutional amendment to restore prayer to public school already this session there be grow bipartisan support for the amendment and i be call on the congress to act speedily to pass it and to let our child pray

 perhaps some of you read recently about the lubbock school case where a judge actually rule that it be unconstitutional for a school district to give equal treatment to religious and nonreligious student group even when the group meeting be be hold during the student own time the first amendment never intend to require government to discriminate against religious speech

 senators denton and hatfield have propose legislation in the congress on the whole question of prohibit discrimination against religious form of student speech such legislation could go far to restore freedom of religious speech for public school student and i hope the congress consider these bill quickly and with your help i think it be possible we could also get the constitutional amendment through the congress this year

 more than a decade ago a supreme court decision literally wipe off the book of 50 state statute protect the right of unborn child abortion on demand now take the life of up to one and a half million unborn child a year human life legislation end this tragedy will some day pass the congress and you and i must never rest until it do unless and until it can be prove that the unborn child be not a live entity then its right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness must be protect

 you may remember that when abortion on demand begin many and indeed i be sure many of you warn that the practice would lead to a decline in respect for human life that the philosophical premise use to justify abortion on demand would ultimately be use to justify other attack on the sacredness of human life infanticide or mercy killing tragically enough those warning prove all too true only last year a court permit the death by starvation of a handicapped infant

 i have direct the health and human services department to make clear to every health care facility in the united states that the rehabilitation act of 1973 protect all handicapped person against discrimination base on handicap include infant and we have take the further step of require that each and every recipient of federal fund who provide health care service to infant must post and keep post in a conspicuous place a notice state that discriminatory failure to feed and care for handicapped infant in this facility be prohibit by federal law it also list a 24 hour toll free number so that nurse and other may report violation in time to save the infant 's life

 in addition recent legislation introduce in the congress by representative henry hyde of illinois not only increase restriction on publicly finance abortion it also address this whole problem of infanticide i urge the congress to begin hearing and to adopt legislation that will protect the right of life to all child include the disabled or handicap

 now i be sure that you must get discourage at time but you have do well than you know perhaps there be a great spiritual awakening in america a renewal of the traditional value that have be the bedrock of america 's goodness and greatness

 one recent survey by a washington base research council conclude that americans be far more religious than the people of other nation 95 percent of those survey express a belief in god and a huge majority believe the ten commandments have real meaning in their life and another study have find that an overwhelming majority of americans disapprove of adultery teenage sex pornography abortion and hard drug and this same study show a deep reverence for the importance of family tie and religious belief

 i think the item that we have discuss here today must be a key part of the nation 's political agenda for the first time the congress be openly and seriously debate and deal with the prayer and abortion issue and that be enormous progress right there i repeat america be in the midst of a spiritual awakening and a moral renewal and with your biblical keynote i say today yes let justice roll on like a river righteousness like a never fail stream

 now obviously much of this new political and social consensus i have talk about be base on a positive view of american history one that take pride in our country 's accomplishment and record but we must never forget that no government scheme be go to perfect man we know that live in this world mean deal with what philosopher would call the phenomenology of evil or as theologian would put it the doctrine of sin

 there be sin and evil in the world and we be enjoin by scripture and the lord jesus to oppose it with all our might our nation too have a legacy of evil with which it must deal the glory of this land have be its capacity for transcend the moral evil of our past for example the long struggle of minority citizen for equal right once a source of disunity and civil war be now a point of pride for all americans we must never go back there be no room for racism anti semitism or other form of ethnic and racial hatred in this country

 i know that you have be horrify as have i by the resurgence of some hate group preach bigotry and prejudice use the mighty voice of your pulpit and the powerful standing of your church to denounce and isolate these hate group in our midst the commandment give we be clear and simple thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself

 but whatever sad episode exist in our past any objective observer must hold a positive view of american history a history that have be the story of hope fulfil and dream make into reality especially in this century america have keep alight the torch of freedom but not just for ourselves but for million of other around the world

 and this bring i to my final point today during my first press conference as president in answer to a direct question i point out that as good marxist leninists the soviet leader have openly and publicly declare that the only morality they recognize be that which will further their cause which be world revolution i think i should point out i be only quote lenin their guide spirit who say in 1920 that they repudiate all morality that proceed from supernatural idea that be their name for religion or idea that be outside class conception morality be entirely subordinate to the interest of class war and everything be moral that be necessary for the annihilation of the old exploit social order and for unite the proletariat

 well i think the refusal of many influential people to accept this elementary fact of soviet doctrine illustrate an historical reluctance to see totalitarian power for what they be we see this phenomenon in the 1930 we see it too often today

 this do not mean we should isolate ourselves and refuse to seek an understanding with they i intend to do everything i can to persuade they of our peaceful intent to remind they that it be the west that refuse to use its nuclear monopoly in the forty and fifty for territorial gain and which now propose 50 percent cut in strategic ballistic missile and the elimination of an entire class of land base intermediate range nuclear missile

 at the same time however they must be make to understand we will never compromise our principle and standard we will never give away our freedom we will never abandon our belief in god and we will never stop search for a genuine peace but we can assure none of these thing america stand for through the so call nuclear freeze solution propose by some

 the truth be that a freeze now would be a very dangerous fraud for that be merely the illusion of peace the reality be that we must find peace through strength

 i would agree to a freeze if only we could freeze the soviets global desire a freeze at current level of weapon would remove any incentive for the soviets to negotiate seriously in geneva and virtually end our chance to achieve the major arm reduction which we have propose instead they would achieve their objective through the freeze

 a freeze would reward the soviet union for its enormous and unparalleled military buildup it would prevent the essential and long overdue modernization of united states and ally defense and would leave our age force increasingly vulnerable and an honest freeze would require extensive prior negotiation on the system and number to be limit and on the measure to ensure effective verification and compliance and the kind of a freeze that have be suggest would be virtually impossible to verify such a major effort would divert we completely from our current negotiation on achieve substantial reduction

 a number of year ago i hear a young father a very prominent young man in the entertainment world address a tremendous gathering in california it be during the time of the cold war and communism and our own way of life be very much on people 's mind and he be speak to that subject and suddenly though i hear he say i love my little girl more than anything and i say to myself oh no do not you can't don't say that but i have underestimate he he go on i would rather see my little girl die now still believe in god than have they grow up under communism and one day die no long believe in god

 there be thousand of young people in that audience they come to their foot with shout of joy they have instantly recognize the profound truth in what he have say with regard to the physical and the soul and what be truly important

 yes let we pray for the salvation of all of those who live in that totalitarian darkness pray they will discover the joy of know god but until they do let we be aware that while they preach the supremacy of the state declare its omnipotence over individual man and predict its eventual domination of all people on the earth they be the focus of evil in the modern world

 it be c.s. lewis who in his unforgettable screwtape letter write the great evil be not do now in those sordid den of crime that dickens love to paint it be not even do in concentration camp and labor camp in those we see its final result but it be conceive and order move seconded carry and minuted in clear carpet warm and well light office by quiet man with white collar and cut fingernail and smooth shaven cheek who do not need to raise their voice

 well because these quiet man do not raise their voice because they sometimes speak in soothe tone of brotherhood and peace because like other dictator before they they be always make their final territorial demand some would have we accept they at their word and accommodate ourselves to their aggressive impulse but if history teach anything it teach that simple minded appeasement or wishful thinking about our adversary be folly it mean the betrayal of our past the squandering of our freedom

 so i urge you to speak out against those who would place the united states in a position of military and moral inferiority you know i have always believe that old screwtape reserve his good effort for those of you in the church so in your discussion of the nuclear freeze proposal i urge you to beware the temptation of pride the temptation of blithely declare yourself above it all and label both side equally at fault to ignore the fact of history and the aggressive impulse of an evil empire to simply call the arm race a giant misunderstanding and thereby remove yourself from the struggle between right and wrong and good and evil

 i ask you to resist the attempt of those who would have you withhold your support for our effort this administration 's effort to keep america strong and free while we negotiate real and verifiable reduction in the world 's nuclear arsenal and one day with god 's help their total elimination

 while america 's military strength be important let i add here that i have always maintain that the struggle now go on for the world will never be decide by bomb or rocket by army or military might the real crisis we face today be a spiritual one at root it be a test of moral will and faith

 whittaker chambers the man whose own religious conversion make he a witness to one of the terrible trauma of our time the hiss chambers case write that the crisis of the western world exist to the degree in which the west be indifferent to god the degree to which it collaborate in communism 's attempt to make man stand alone without god and then he say for marxism leninism be actually the second old faith first proclaim in the garden of eden with the word of temptation ye shall be as god

 the western world can answer this challenge he write but only provide that its faith in god and the freedom he enjoin be as great as communism 's faith in man

 i believe we shall rise to the challenge i believe that communism be another sad bizarre chapter in human history whose last page even now be be write i believe this because the source of our strength in the quest for human freedom be not material but spiritual and because it know no limitation it must terrify and ultimately triumph over those who would enslave their fellow man for in the word of isaiah he giveth power to the faint and to they that have no might he increase strength but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wing as eagle they shall run and not be weary

 yes change your world one of our founding fathers thomas paine say we have it within our power to begin the world over again we can do it do together what no one church could do by itself

 god bless you and thank you very much

my fellow americans thank you for share your time with i tonight

 the subject i want to discuss with you peace and national security be both timely and important timely because i have reach a decision which offer a new hope for our child in the 21st century a decision i will tell you about in a few minute and important because there be a very big decision that you must make for yourself this subject involve the most basic duty that any president and any people share the duty to protect and strengthen the peace

 at the beginning of this year i submit to the congress a defense budget which reflect my good judgment of the good understanding of the expert and specialist who advise i about what we and our ally must do to protect our people in the year ahead that budget be much more than a long list of number for behind all the number lie america 's ability to prevent the great of human tragedy and preserve our free way of life in a sometimes dangerous world it be part of a careful long term plan to make america strong again after too many year of neglect and mistake

 our effort to rebuild america 's defense and strengthen the peace begin 2 year ago when we request a major increase in the defense program since then the amount of those increase we first propose have be reduce by half through improvement in management and procurement and other saving

 the budget request that be now before the congress have be trim to the limit of safety far deep cut can not be make without seriously endanger the security of the nation the choice be up to the man and woman you have elect to the congress and that mean the choice be up to you

 tonight i want to explain to you what this defense debate be all about and why i be convinced that the budget now before the congress be necessary responsible and deserve of your support and i want to offer hope for the future

 but first let i say what the defense debate be not about it be not about spend arithmetic i know that in the last few week you have be bombard with number and percentage some say we need only a 5 percent increase in defense spending the so call alternate budget back by liberal in the house of representatives would lower the figure to 2 to 3 percent cut our defense spending by $ 163 billion over the next 5 year the trouble with all these number be that they tell we little about the kind of defense program america need or the benefit and security and freedom that our defense effort buy for we

 what seem to have be lose in all this debate be the simple truth of how a defense budget be arrive at it be not do by decide to spend a certain number of dollar those loud voice that be occasionally hear charge that the government be try to solve a security problem by throw money at it be nothing more than noise base on ignorance we start by consider what must be do to maintain peace and review all the possible threat against our security then a strategy for strengthen peace and defend against those threat must be agree upon and finally our defense establishment must be evaluate to see what be necessary to protect against any or all of the potential threat the cost of achieve these end be total up and the result be the budget for national defense

 there be no logical way that you can say let us spend x billion dollar less you can only say which part of our defense measure do we believe we can do without and still have security against all contingency anyone in the congress who advocate a percentage or a specific dollar cut in defense spending should be make to say what part of our defense he would eliminate and he should be candid enough to acknowledge that his cut mean cut our commitment to ally or invite great risk or both

 the defense policy of the united states be base on a simple premise the united states do not start fight we will never be an aggressor we maintain our strength in order to deter and defend against aggression to preserve freedom and peace

 since the dawn of the atomic age we have seek to reduce the risk of war by maintain a strong deterrent and by seek genuine arm control deterrence mean simply this make sure any adversary who think about attack the united states or our ally or our vital interest conclude that the risk to he outweigh any potential gain once he understand that he will not attack we maintain the peace through our strength weakness only invite aggression

 this strategy of deterrence have not change it still work but what it take to maintain deterrence have change it take one kind of military force to deter an attack when we have far more nuclear weapon than any other power it take another kind now that the soviets for example have enough accurate and powerful nuclear weapon to destroy virtually all of our missile on the ground now this be not to say that the soviet union be plan to make war on we nor do i believe a war be inevitable quite the contrary but what must be recognize be that our security be base on be prepared to meet all threat

 there be a time when we depend on coastal fort and artillery battery because with the weaponry of that day any attack would have have to come by sea well this be a different world and our defense must be base on recognition and awareness of the weaponry possess by other nation in the nuclear age

 we can not afford to believe that we will never be threaten there have be two world war in my lifetime we do not start they and indeed do everything we could to avoid be draw into they but we be ill prepared for both have we be well prepare peace might have be preserve

 for 20 year the soviet union have be accumulate enormous military might they do not stop when their force exceed all requirement of a legitimate defensive capability and they have not stop now during the past decade and a half the soviets have build up a massive arsenal of new strategic nuclear weapon weapon that can strike directly at the united states

 as an example the united states introduce its last new intercontinental ballistic missile the minute man iii in 1969 and we be now dismantle our even old titan missile but what have the soviet union do in these intervene year well since 1969 the soviet union have build five new class of icbm 's and upgrade these eight time as a result their missile be much more powerful and accurate than they be several year ago and they continue to develop more while ours be increasingly obsolete

 the same thing have happen in other area over the same period the soviet union build 4 new class of submarine launch ballistic missile and over 60 new missile submarine we build 2 new type of submarine missile and actually withdraw 10 submarine from strategic mission the soviet union build over 200 new backfire bomber and their brand new blackjack bomber be now under development we have not build a new long range bomber since our b-52 's be deploy about a quarter of a century ago and we have already retire several hundred of those because of old age indeed despite what many people think our strategic force only cost about 15 percent of the defense budget

 another example of what be happen in 1978 the soviets have 600 intermediate range nuclear missile base on land and be begin to add the ss-20 a new highly accurate mobile missile with 3 warhead we have none since then the soviets have strengthen their lead by the end of 1979 when soviet leader brezhnev declare a balance now exist the soviets have over 800 warhead we still have none a year ago this month mr. brezhnev pledge a moratorium or freeze on ss-20 deployment but by last august their 800 warhead have become more than 1,200 we still have none some freeze at this time soviet defense minister ustinov announce approximate parity of force continue to exist but the soviets be still add an average of 3 new warhead a week and now have 1,300 these warhead can reach their target in a matter of a few minute we still have none so far it seem that the soviet definition of parity be a box score of 1,300 to nothing in their favor

 so together with our nato ally we decide in 1979 to deploy new weapon begin this year as a deterrent to their ss—20 's and as an incentive to the soviet union to meet we in serious arm control negotiation we will begin that deployment late this year at the same time however we be willing to cancel our program if the soviets will dismantle theirs this be what we have call a zero zero plan the soviets be now at the negotiate table and i think it be fair to say that without our plan deployment they would not be there

 now let us consider conventional force since 1974 the united states have produce 3,050 tactical combat aircraft by contrast the soviet union have produce twice as many when we look at attack submarine the united states have produce 27 while the soviet union have produce 61 for armored vehicle include tank we have produce 11,200 the soviet union have produce 54,000 nearly 5 to 1 in their favor finally with artillery we have produce 950 artillery and rocket launcher while the soviets have produce more than 13,000 a staggering 14 to-1 ratio

 there be a time when we be able to offset superior soviet number with high quality but today they be build weapon as sophisticated and modern as our own

 as the soviets have increase their military power they have be embolden to extend that power they be spread their military influence in way that can directly challenge our vital interest and those of our ally

 the follow aerial photograph most of they secret until now illustrate this point in a crucial area very close to home central america and the caribbean basin they be not dramatic photograph but i think they help give you a well understanding of what i be talk about

 this soviet intelligence collection facility less than a hundred mile from our coast be the large of its kind in the world the acre and acre of antennae field and intelligence monitor be target on key u.s. military installation and sensitive activity the installation in lourdes cuba be man by 1,500 soviet technician and the satellite ground station allow instant communication with moscow this 28 square mile facility have grow by more than 60 percent in size and capability during the past decade

 in western cuba we see this military airfield and it complement of modern soviet build mig-23 aircraft the soviet union use this cuban airfield for its own long range reconnaissance mission and early this month two modern soviet antisubmarine warfare aircraft begin operate from it during the past 2 year the level of soviet arm export to cuba can only be compare to the level reach during the cuban missile crisis 20 year ago

 this third photo which be the only one in this series that have be previously make public show soviet military hardware that have make its way to central america this airfield with its mi-8 helicopter anti aircraft gun and protect fighter site be one of a number of military facility in nicaragua which have receive soviet equipment funnel through cuba and reflect the massive military buildup go on in that country

 on the small island of grenada at the southern end of the caribbean chain the cubans with soviet financing and backing be in the process of build an airfield with a 10,000 foot runway grenada do not even have an air force who be it intend for the caribbean be a very important passageway for our international commerce and military line of communication more than half of all american oil import now pass through the caribbean the rapid buildup of grenada 's military potential be unrelated to any conceivable threat to this island country of under 110,000 people and totally at odd with the pattern of other eastern caribbean states most of which be unarmed

 the soviet cuban militarization of grenada in short can only be see as power projection into the region and it be in this important economic and strategic area that we be try to help the government of el salvador costa rica honduras and other in their struggle for democracy against guerrilla support through cuba and nicaragua

 these picture only tell a small part of the story i wish i could show you more without compromise our most sensitive intelligence source and method but the soviet union be also support cuban military force in angola and ethiopia they have basis in ethiopia and south yemen near the persian gulf oil field they have take over the port that we build at cam ranh bay in vietnam and now for the first time in history the soviet navy be a force to be reckon with in the south pacific

 some people may still ask would the soviets ever use their formidable military power well again can we afford to believe they will not there be afghanistan and in poland the soviets deny the will of the people and in so do demonstrate to the world how their military power could also be use to intimidate

 the final fact be that the soviet union be acquire what can only be consider an offensive military force they have continue to build far more intercontinental ballistic missile than they could possibly need simply to deter an attack their conventional force be train and equip not so much to defend against an attack as they be to permit sudden surprise offensive of their own

 our nato ally have assume a great defense burden include the military draft in most country we be work with they and our other friend around the world to do more our defensive strategy mean we need military force that can move very quickly force that be train and ready to respond to any emergency

 every item in our defense program our ship our tank our plane our fund for training and spare part be intend for one all important purpose to keep the peace unfortunately a decade of neglect our military force have call into question our ability to do that

 when i take office in january 1981 i be appal by what i find american plane that could not fly and american ship that could not sail for lack of spare part and train personnel and insufficient fuel and ammunition for essential training the inevitable result of all this be poor morale in our armed forces difficulty in recruit the bright young americans to wear the uniform and difficulty in convince our most experienced military personnel to stay on

 there be a real question then about how well we could meet a crisis and it be obvious that we have to begin a major modernization program to ensure we could deter aggression and preserve the peace in the year ahead

 we have to move immediately to improve the basic readiness and staying power of our conventional force so they could meet and therefore help deter a crisis we have to make up for lost year of investment by move forward with a long term plan to prepare our force to counter the military capability our adversary be develop for the future

 i know that all of you want peace and so do i. i know too that many of you seriously believe that a nuclear freeze would further the cause of peace but a freeze now would make we less not more secure and would raise not reduce the risk of war it would be largely unverifiable and would seriously undercut our negotiation on arm reduction it would reward the soviets for their massive military buildup while prevent we from modernize our age and increasingly vulnerable force with their present margin of superiority why should they agree to arm reduction know that we be prohibit from catch up

 believe i it be not pleasant for someone who have come to washington determine to reduce government spending but we have to move forward with the task of repair our defense or we would lose our ability to deter conflict now and in the future we have to demonstrate to any adversary that aggression could not succeed and that the only real solution be substantial equitable and effectively verifiable arm reduction the kind we be work for right now in geneva

 thank to your strong support and bipartisan support from the congress we begin to turn thing around already we be see some very encouraging result quality recruitment and retention be up dramatically more high school graduate be choose military career and more experienced career personnel be choose to stay our man and woman in uniform at last be get the tool and training they need to do their job

 ask around today especially among our young people and i think you will find a whole new attitude toward serve their country this reflect more than just well pay equipment and leadership you the american people have send a signal to these young people that it be once again an honor to wear the uniform that be not something you measure in a budget but it be a very real part of our nation 's strength

 it will take we long to build the kind of equipment we need to keep peace in the future but we have make a good start

 we have not build a new long range bomber for 21 year now we be build the b-1 we have not launch one new strategic submarine for 17 year now we be build one trident submarine a year our land base missile be increasingly threaten by the many huge new soviet icbm 's we be determine how to solve that problem at the same time we be work in the start and inf negotiation with the goal of achieve deep reduction in the strategic and intermediate nuclear arsenal of both side

 we have also begin the long need modernization of our conventional force the army be get its first new tank in 20 year the air force be modernize we be rebuild our navy which shrink from about a thousand ship in the late 1960 's to 453 during the 1970 's our nation need a superior navy to support our military force and vital interest overseas we be now on the road to achieve a 600 ship navy and increase the amphibious capability of our marine who be now serve the cause of peace in lebanon and we be build a real capability to assist our friend in the vitally important indian ocean and persian gulf region

 this add up to a major effort and it be not cheap it come at a time when there be many other pressure on our budget and when the american people have already have to make major sacrifice during the recession but we must not be mislead by those who would make defense once again the scapegoat of the federal budget

 the fact be that in the past few decade we have see a dramatic shift in how we spend the taxpayer 's dollar back in 1955 payment to individual take up only about 20 percent of the federal budget for nearly three decade these payment steadily increase and this year will account for 49 percent of the budget by contrast in 1955 defense take up more than half of the federal budget by 1980 this spending have fall to a low of 23 percent even with the increase that i be request this year defense will still amount to only 28 percent of the budget

 the call for cut back the defense budget come in nice simple arithmetic they be the same kind of talk that lead the democracy to neglect their defense in the 1930 's and invite the tragedy of world war ii we must not let that grim chapter of history repeat itself through apathy or neglect

 this be why i be speak to you tonight to urge you to tell your senator and congressman that you know we must continue to restore our military strength if we stop in midstream we will send a signal of decline of lessened will to friend and adversary alike free people must voluntarily through open debate and democratic mean meet the challenge that totalitarian pose by compulsion it be up to we in our time to choose and choose wisely between the hard but necessary task of preserve peace and freedom and the temptation to ignore our duty and blindly hope for the good while the enemy of freedom grow strong day by day

 the solution be well within our grasp but to reach it there be simply no alternative but to continue this year in this budget to provide the resource we need to preserve the peace and guarantee our freedom

 now thus far tonight i have share with you my thought on the problem of national security we must face together my predecessor in the oval office have appear before you on other occasion to describe the threat pose by soviet power and have propose step to address that threat but since the advent of nuclear weapon those step have be increasingly direct toward deterrence of aggression through the promise of retaliation

 this approach to stability through offensive threat have work we and our ally have succeed in prevent nuclear war for more than three decade in recent month however my adviser include in particular the joint chiefs of staff have underscore the necessity to break out of a future that rely solely on offensive retaliation for our security

 over the course of these discussion i have become more and more deeply convinced that the human spirit must be capable of rise above deal with other nation and human being by threaten their existence feel this way i believe we must thoroughly examine every opportunity for reduce tension and for introduce great stability into the strategic calculus on both side

 one of the most important contribution we can make be of course to lower the level of all arm and particularly nuclear arm we be engage right now in several negotiation with the soviet union to bring about a mutual reduction of weapon i will report to you a week from tomorrow my thought on that score but let i just say i be totally committed to this course

 if the soviet union will join with we in our effort to achieve major arm reduction we will have succeed in stabilize the nuclear balance nevertheless it will still be necessary to rely on the specter of retaliation on mutual threat and that be a sad commentary on the human condition would not it be well to save life than to avenge they be we not capable of demonstrate our peaceful intention by apply all our ability and our ingenuity to achieve a truly last stability i think we be indeed we must

 after careful consultation with my adviser include the joint chiefs of staff i believe there be a way let i share with you a vision of the future which offer hope it be that we embark on a program to counter the awesome soviet missile threat with measure that be defensive let we turn to the very strength in technology that spawn our great industrial base and that have give we the quality of life we enjoy today

 what if free people could live secure in the knowledge that their security do not rest upon the threat of instant u.s. retaliation to deter a soviet attack that we could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missile before they reach our own soil or that of our ally

 i know this be a formidable technical task one that may not be accomplish before the end of this century yet current technology have attain a level of sophistication where it be reasonable for we to begin this effort it will take year probably decade of effort on many front there will be failure and setback just as there will be success and breakthrough and as we proceed we must remain constant in preserve the nuclear deterrent and maintain a solid capability for flexible response but be not it worth every investment necessary to free the world from the threat of nuclear war we know it be

 in the meantime we will continue to pursue real reduction in nuclear arm negotiate from a position of strength that can be ensure only by modernize our strategic force at the same time we must take step to reduce the risk of a conventional military conflict escalate to nuclear war by improve our nonnuclear capability

 america do possess now the technology to attain very significant improvement in the effectiveness of our conventional nonnuclear force proceed boldly with these new technology we can significantly reduce any incentive that the soviet union may have to threaten attack against the united states or its ally

 as we pursue our goal of defensive technology we recognize that our ally rely upon our strategic offensive power to deter attack against they their vital interest and our be inextricably link their safety and our be one and no change in technology can or will alter that reality we must and shall continue to honor our commitment

 i clearly recognize that defensive system have limitation and raise certain problem and ambiguity if pair with offensive system they can be view as foster an aggressive policy and no one want that but with these consideration firmly in mind i call upon the scientific community in our country those who give we nuclear weapon to turn their great talent now to the cause of mankind and world peace to give we the mean of render these nuclear weapon impotent and obsolete

 tonight consistent with our obligation of the abm treaty and recognize the need for close consultation with our ally i be take an important first step i be direct a comprehensive and intensive effort to define a long term research and development program to begin to achieve our ultimate goal of eliminate the threat pose by strategic nuclear missile this could pave the way for arm control measure to eliminate the weapon themselves we seek neither military superiority nor political advantage our only purpose one all people share be to search for way to reduce the danger of nuclear war

 my fellow americans tonight we be launch an effort which hold the promise of change the course of human history there will be risk and result take time but i believe we can do it as we cross this threshold i ask for your prayer and your support

 thank you good night and god bless you

mr. speaker mr. president distinguished members of the congress honored guest and my fellow americans

 a number of time in past year members of congress and a president have come together in meeting like this to resolve a crisis i have ask for this meeting in the hope that we can prevent one

 it would be hard to find many americans who be not aware of our stake in the middle east the persian gulf or the nato line divide the free world from the communist bloc and the same could be say for asia

 but in spite of or maybe because of a flurry of story about place like nicaragua and el salvador and yes some concert propaganda many of we find it hard to believe we have a stake in problem involve those country too many have think of central america as just that place way down below mexico that can not possibly constitute a threat to our well being and that be why i have ask for this session central america 's problem do directly affect the security and the well being of our own people and central america be much close to the united states than many of the world troublespot that concern we so we work to restore our own economy we can not afford to lose sight of our neighbor to the south

 el salvador be near to texas than texas be to massachusetts nicaragua be just as close to miami san antonio san diego and tucson as those city be to washington where we be gather tonight

 but nearness on the map do not even begin to tell the strategic importance of central america border as it do on the caribbean our lifeline to the outside world two third of all our foreign trade and petroleum pass through the panama canal and the caribbean in a european crisis at least half of our supply for nato would go through these area by sea it be well to remember that in early 1942 a handful of hitler 's submarine sink more tonnage there than in all of the atlantic ocean and they do this without a single naval base anywhere in the area and today the situation be different cuba be host to a soviet combat brigade a submarine base capable of service soviet submarine and military air basis visit regularly by soviet military aircraft

 because of its importance the caribbean basin be a magnet for adventurism we be all aware of the libyan cargo plane refuel in brazil a few day ago on their way to deliver medical supply to nicaragua brazilian authority discover the so call medical supply be actually munition and prevent their delivery

 you may remember that last month speak on national television i show an aerial photo of an airfield be build on the island of grenada well if that airfield have be complete those plane could have refuel there and complete their journey

 if the nazis during world war ii and the soviets today could recognize the caribbean and central america as vital to our interest should not we also for several year now under two administration the united states have be increase its defense of freedom in the caribbean basin and i can tell you tonight democracy be begin to take root in el salvador which until a short time ago know only dictatorship

 the new government be now deliver on its promise of democracy reform and free election it be not easy and there be resistance to many of the attempt reform with assassination of some of the reformer guerrilla band and urban terrorist be portray in a worldwide propaganda campaign as freedom fighter representative of the people ten day before i come into office the guerrilla launch what they call a final offensive to overthrow the government and their radio boast that our new administration would be too late to prevent their victory

 well they learn that democracy can not be so easily defeat president carter do not hesitate he authorize arm and munition to el salvador the guerrilla offensive fail but not america 's will every president since this country assume global responsibility have know that those responsibility could only be meet if we pursue a bipartisan foreign policy

 as i say a moment ago the government of el salvador have be keep its promise like the land reform program which be make thousand of farm tenant farm owner in a little over 3 year 20 percent of the arable land in el salvador have be redistribute to more than 450,000 people that be one in ten salvadorans who have benefit directly from this program

 el salvador have continue to strive toward an orderly and democratic society the government promise free election on march 28th a little more than a year ago after month of campaigning by a variety of candidate the suffer people of el salvador be offer a chance to vote to choose the kind of government they want and suddenly the so call freedom fighter in the hill be expose for what they really be a small minority who want power for themselves and their backer not democracy for the people the guerrilla threaten death to anyone who vote they destroy hundred of bus and truck to keep the people from get to the polling place their slogan be brutal vote today die tonight but on election day an unprecedented 80 percent of the electorate brave ambush and gunfire and trudge for mile many of they to vote for freedom now that be truly fight for freedom we can never turn our back on that

 member of this congress who go there as observer tell i of a woman who be wound by rifle fire on the way to the poll who refuse to leave the line to have her wound treat until after she have vote another woman have be tell by the guerrilla that she would be kill when she return from the poll and she tell the guerrilla you can kill i you can kill my family you can kill my neighbor you can not kill we all the real freedom fighter of el salvador turn out to be the people of that country the young the old the in between more than a million of they out of a population of less than 5 million the world should respect this courage and not allow it to be belittle or forget and again i say in good conscience we can never turn our back on that

 the democratic political party and faction in el salvador be come together around the common goal of seek a political solution to their country 's problem new national election will be hold this year and they will be open to all political party the government have invite the guerrilla to participate in the election and be prepare an amnesty law the people of el salvador be earn their freedom and they deserve our moral and material support to protect it

 yes there be still major problem regard human right the criminal justice system and violence against noncombatant and like the rest of central america el salvador also face severe economic problem but in addition to recession depress price for major agricultural export el salvador 's economy be be deliberately sabotage

 tonight in el salvador because of ruthless guerrilla attack much of the fertile land can not be cultivate less than half the roll stock of the railway remain operational bridge water facility telephone and electric system have be destroy and damage in one 22 month period there be 5,000 interruption of electrical power one region be without electricity for a third of the year

 i think secretary of state shultz put it very well the other day unable to win the free loyalty of el salvador 's people the guerrilla he say be deliberately and systematically deprive they of food water transportation light sanitation and job and these be the people who claim they want to help the common people they do not want election because they know they would be defeat but as the previous election show the salvadoran people 's desire for democracy will not be defeat

 the guerrilla be not embattle peasant arm with musket they be professional sometimes with well training and weaponry than the government 's soldier the salvadoran battalion that have receive u.s. training have be conduct themselves well on the battlefield and with the civilian population but so far we have only provide enough money to train one salvadoran soldier out of ten few than the number of guerrilla that be train by nicaragua and cuba

 and let i set the record straight on nicaragua a country next to el salvador in 1979 when the new government take over in nicaragua after a revolution which overthrow the authoritarian rule of somoza everyone hope for the growth of democracy we in the united states do too by january of 1981 our emergency relief and recovery aid to nicaragua total $ 118 million more than provide by any other develop country in fact in the first 2 year of sandinista rule the united states directly or indirectly send five time more aid to nicaragua than it have in the 2 year prior to the revolution can anyone doubt the generosity and the good faith of the american people

 these be hardly the action of a nation implacably hostile to nicaragua yet the government of nicaragua have treat we as an enemy it have reject our repeat peace effort it have break its promise to we to the organization of american states and most important of all to the people of nicaragua

 no soon be victory achieve than a small clique oust other who have be part of the revolution from have any voice in the government humberto ortega the minister of defense declare marxism leninism would be their guide and so it be

 the government of nicaragua have impose a new dictatorship it have refuse to hold the election it promise it have seize control of most medium and subject all medium to heavy prior censorship it deny the bishop and priest of the roman catholic church the right to say mass on radio during holy week it insult and mock the pope it have drive the miskito indians from their homeland burn their village destroy their crop and force they into involuntary internment camp far from home it have move against the private sector and free labor union it condone mob action against nicaragua 's independent human right commission and drive the director of that commission into exile

 in short after all these act of repression by the government be it any wonder that opposition have form contrary to propaganda the opponent of the sandinistas be not diehard supporter of the previous somoza regime in fact many be anti somoza hero and fight beside the sandinistas to bring down the somoza government now they have be deny any part in the new government because they truly want democracy for nicaragua and they still do other be miskito indians fight for their home their land and their life

 the sandinista revolution in nicaragua turn out to be just an exchange of one set of autocratic ruler for another and the people still have no freedom no democratic right and more poverty even bad than its predecessor it be help cuba and the soviets to destabilize our hemisphere

 meanwhile the government of el salvador make every effort to guarantee democracy free labor union freedom of religion and a free press be under attack by guerrilla dedicate to the same philosophy that prevail in nicaragua cuba and yes the soviet union violence have be nicaragua 's most important export to the world it be the ultimate in hypocrisy for the unelected nicaraguan government to charge that we seek their overthrow when they be do everything they can to bring down the elect government of el salvador thank you the guerrilla attack be direct from a headquarters in managua the capital of nicaragua

 but let we be clear as to the american attitude toward the government of nicaragua we do not seek its overthrow our interest be to ensure that it do not infect its neighbor through the export of subversion and violence our purpose in conformity with american and international law be to prevent the flow of arm to el salvador honduras guatemala and costa rica we have attempt to have a dialog with the government of nicaragua but it persist in its effort to spread violence

 we should not and we will not protect the nicaraguan government from the anger of its own people but we should through diplomacy offer an alternative and as nicaragua ponder its option we can and will with all the resource of diplomacy protect each country of central america from the danger of war

 even costa rica central america 's old and strong democracy a government so peaceful it do not even have an army be the object of bullying and threat from nicaragua 's dictator

 nicaragua 's neighbor know that sandinista promise of peace nonalliance and nonintervention have not be keep some 36 new military basis have be build there be only 13 during the somoza year nicaragua 's new army number 25,000 man support by a militia of 50,000 it be the large army in central america supplement by 2,000 cuban military and security adviser it be equip with the most modern weapon dozen of soviet make tank 800 sovietbloc truck soviet 152 millimeter howitzer 100 anti aircraft gun plus plane and helicopter there be additional thousand of civilian adviser from cuba the soviet union east germany libya and the plo and we be attack because we have 55 military trainer in el salvador

 the goal of the professional guerrilla movement in central america be as simple as it be sinister to destabilize the entire region from the panama canal to mexico and if you doubt beyond this point just consider what cayetano carpio the now decease salvadoran guerrilla leader say early this month carpio say that after el salvador fall el salvador and nicaragua would be arm in arm and struggle for the total liberation of central america

 nicaragua 's dictatorial junta who themselves make war and win power operate from basis in honduras and costa rica like to pretend that they be today be attack by force base in honduras the fact be it be nicaragua 's government that threaten hondura not the reverse it be nicaragua who have move heavy tank close to the border and nicaragua who speak of war it be nicaraguan radio that announce on april 8th the creation of a new unified revolutionary coordinating board to push forward the marxist struggle in honduras

 nicaragua support by weapon and military resource provide by the communist bloc repress its own people refuse to make peace and sponsor a guerrilla war against el salvador

 president truman 's word be as apt today as they be in 1947 when he too speak before a joint session of the congress

 at the present moment in world history nearly every nation must choose between alternate way of life the choice be not too often a free one one way of life be base upon the will of the majority and be distinguish by free institution representative government free election guarantee of individual liberty freedom of speech and religion and freedom from political oppression the second way of life be base upon the will of a minority forcibly impose upon the majority it rely upon terror and oppression a control press and radio fix election and the suppression of personal freedom

 i believe that it must be the policy of the united states to support free people who be resist attempt subjugation by armed minority or by outside pressure i believe that we must assist free people to work out their own destiny in their own way i believe that our help should be primarily through economic and financial aid which be essential to economic stability and orderly political process

 collapse of free institution and loss of independence would be disastrous not only for they but for the world discouragement and possibly failure would quickly be the lot of neighboring people strive to maintain their freedom and independence

 the country of central america be small than the nation that prompt president truman 's message but the political and strategic stake be the same will our response economic social military be as appropriate and successful as mr. truman 's bold solution to the problem of postwar europe

 some people have forget the success of those year and the decade of peace prosperity and freedom they secure some people talk as though the united states be incapable of act effectively in international affair without risk war or damage those we seek to help

 be democracy require to remain passive while threat to their security and prosperity accumulate must we just accept the destabilization of an entire region from the panama canal to mexico on our southern border must we sit by while independent nation of this hemisphere be integrate into the most aggressive empire the modern world have see must we wait while central americans be drive from their home like the more than a million who have seek refuge out of afghanistan or the 1 1/2 million who have flee indochina or the more than a million cubans who have flee castro 's caribbean utopia must we by default leave the people of el salvador no choice but to flee their home create another tragic human exodus

 i do not believe there be a majority in the congress or the country that counsel passivity resignation defeatism in the face of this challenge to freedom and security in our own hemisphere thank you thank you

 i do not believe that a majority of the congress or the country be prepared to stand by passively while the people of central america be deliver to totalitarianism and we ourselves be leave vulnerable to new danger

 only last week an official of the soviet union reiterate brezhnev 's threat to station nuclear missile in this hemisphere 5 minute from the united states like an echo nicaragua 's commandante daniel ortega confirm that if ask his country would consider accept those missile i understand that today they may be have second thought

 now before i go any far let i say to those who invoke the memory of vietnam there be no thought of send american combat troop to central america they be not need

 thank you and as i say they be not need and indeed they have not be request there all our neighbor ask of we be assistance in training and arm to protect themselves while they build a well free life

 we must continue to encourage peace among the nation of central america we must support the regional effort now underway to promote solution to regional problem

 we can not be certain that the marxist leninist band who believe war be an instrument of politic will be readily discourage it be crucial that we not become discouraged before they do otherwise the region 's freedom will be lose and our security damage in way that can hardly be calculate

 if central america be to fall what would the consequence be for our position in asia europe and for alliance such as nato if the united states can not respond to a threat near our own border why should europeans or asians believe that we be seriously concerned about threat to they if the soviets can assume that nothing short of an actual attack on the united states will provoke an american response which ally which friend will trust we then

 the congress share both the power and the responsibility for our foreign policy tonight i ask you the congress to join i in a bold generous approach to the problem of peace and poverty democracy and dictatorship in the region join i in a program that prevent communist victory in the short run but go beyond to produce for the deprived people of the area the reality of present progress and the promise of more to come

 let we lay the foundation for a bipartisan approach to sustain the independence and freedom of the country of central america we in the administration reach out to you in this spirit

 we will pursue four basic goal in central america

 first in response to decade of inequity and indifference we will support democracy reform and human freedom this mean use our assistance our power of persuasion and our legitimate leverage to bolster humane democratic system where they already exist and to help country on their way to that goal complete the process as quickly as human institution can be change election in el salvador and also in nicaragua must be open to all fair and safe the international community must help we will work at human right problem not walk away from they

 second in response to the challenge of world recession and in the case of el salvador to the unrelenting campaign of economic sabotage by the guerrilla we will support economic development and by a margin of 2 to 1 our aid be economic now not military seventy seven cent out of every dollar we will spend in the area this year go for food fertilizer and other essential for economic growth and development and our economic program go beyond traditional aid the caribbean initiative introduce in the house early today will provide powerful trade and investment incentive to help these country achieve self sustain economic growth without export u.s. job our goal must be to focus our immense and grow technology to enhance health care agriculture industry and to ensure that we who inhabit this interdependent region come to know and understand each other well retain our diverse identity respect our diverse tradition and institution

 and third in response to the military challenge from cuba and nicaragua to their deliberate use of force to spread tyranny we will support the security of the region 's threatened nation we do not view security assistance as an end in itself but as a shield for democratization economic development and diplomacy no amount of reform will bring peace so long as guerrilla believe they will win by force no amount of economic help will suffice if guerrilla unit can destroy road and bridge and power station and crop again and again with impunity but with well training and material help our neighbor can hold off the guerrilla and give democratic reform time to take root

 and fourth we will support dialog and negotiation both among the country of the region and within each country the term and condition of participation in election be negotiable costa rica be a shine example of democracy hondura have make the move from military rule to democratic government guatemala be pledge to the same course the united states will work toward a political solution in central america which will serve the interest of the democratic process

 to support these diplomatic goal i offer these assurance the united states will support any agreement among central american country for the withdrawal under fully verifiable and reciprocal condition of all foreign military and security adviser and troop we want to help opposition group join the political process in all country and compete by ballot instead of bullet we will support any verifiable reciprocal agreement among central american country on the renunciation of support for insurgency on neighbor territory and finally we desire to help central america end its costly arm race and will support any verifiable reciprocal agreement on the nonimportation of offensive weapon

 to move we toward these goal more rapidly i be tonight announce my intention to name an ambassador at large as my special envoy to central america he or she will report to i through the secretary of state the ambassador 's responsibility will be to lend u.s. support to the effort of regional government to bring peace to this troubled area and to work closely with the congress to assure the full possible bipartisan coordination of our policy toward the region

 what i be ask for be prompt congressional approval for the full reprogramming of fund for key current economic and security program so that the people of central america can hold the line against externally support aggression in addition i be ask for prompt action on the supplemental request in these same area to carry we through the current fiscal year and for early and favorable congressional action on my request for fiscal year 1984

 and finally i be ask that the bipartisan consensus which last year act on the trade and tax provision of the caribbean basin initiative in the house again take the lead to move this vital proposal to the floor of both chambers and as i say before the great share of these request be target toward economic and humanitarian aid not military

 what the administration be ask for on behalf of freedom in central america be so small so minimal consider what be at stake the total amount request for aid to all of central america in 1984 be about $ 600 million that be less than one tenth of what americans will spend this year on coin operate video game

 in summation i say to you that tonight there can be no question the national security of all the americas be at stake in central america if we can not defend ourselves there we can not expect to prevail elsewhere our credibility would collapse our alliance would crumble and the safety of our homeland would be put in jeopardy

 we have a vital interest a moral duty and a solemn responsibility this be not a partisan issue it be a question of our meeting our moral responsibility to ourselves our friend and our posterity it be a duty that fall on all of we the president the congress and the people we must perform it together who among we would wish to bear responsibility for fail to meet our share obligation

 thank you god bless you and good night





my fellow americans

 i be come before you tonight about the korean airline massacre the attack by the soviet union against 269 innocent man woman and child aboard an unarmed korean passenger plane this crime against humanity must never be forget here or throughout the world

 our prayer tonight be with the victim and their family in their time of terrible grief our heart go out to they to brave people like kathryn mcdonald the wife of a congressman whose composure and eloquence on the day of her husband 's death move we all he will be sorely miss by all of we here in government

 the parent of one slain couple wire i our daughter and her husband die on korean airline flight 007 their death be the result of the soviet union violate every concept of human right the emotion of these parent grief shock anger be share by civilized people everywhere from around the world press account reflect an explosion of condemnation by people everywhere

 let i state as plainly as i can there be absolutely no justification either legal or moral for what the soviets do one newspaper in india say if every passenger plane be fair game for home air force it will be the end to civil aviation as we know it

 this be not the first time the soviet union have shoot at and hit a civilian airliner when it overflew its territory in another tragic incident in 1978 the soviets also shoot down an unarmed civilian airliner after having positively identify it as such in that instance the soviet interceptor pilot clearly identify the civilian marking on the side of the aircraft repeatedly question the order to fire on a civilian airliner and be order to shoot it down anyway the aircraft be hit with a missile and make a crash landing several innocent people lose their life in this attack kill by shrapnel from the blast of a soviet missile

 be this a practice of other country in the world the answer be no commercial aircraft from the soviet union and cuba on a number of occasion have overflown sensitive united states military facility they be not shoot down we and other civilized country believe in the tradition of offer help to mariner and pilot who be lose or in distress on the sea or in the air we believe in follow procedure to prevent a tragedy not to provoke one

 but despite the savagery of their crime the universal reaction against it and the evidence of their complicity the soviets still refuse to tell the truth they have persistently refuse to admit that their pilot fire on the korean aircraft indeed they have not even tell their own people that a plane be shoot down

 they have spin a confused tale of track the plane by radar until it just mysteriously disappear from their radar screen but no one fire a shot of any kind but then they couple this with charge that it be a spy plane send by we and that their plane fire tracer bullet past the plane as a warning that it be in soviet airspace

 let i recap for a moment and present the incontrovertible evidence that we have the korean airliner a boeing 747 leave anchorage alaska bind for seoul korea on a course south and west which would take it across japan out over the pacific in international water it be for a brief time in the vicinity of one of our reconnaissance plane an rc-135 on a routine mission at no time be the rc-135 in soviet airspace the korean airliner fly on and the two plane be soon widely separate

 the 747 be equip with the most modern computerized navigation facility but a computer must respond to input provide by human hand no one will ever know whether a mistake be make in give the computer the course or whether there be a malfunction whichever the 747 be fly a course far to the west than it be suppose to fly a course which take it into soviet airspace

 the soviets track this plane for 2 1/2 hour while it fly a straight line course at 30 to 35,000 foot only civilian airliner fly in such a manner at one point the korean pilot give japanese air control his position as east of hokkaido japan show that he be unaware they be off course by as much or more than a hundred mile

 the soviets scramble jet interceptor from a base in sakhalin island japanese ground site record the interceptor plane radio transmission their conversation with their own ground control we only have the voice from the pilot the soviet ground to air transmission be not record it be plain however from the pilot 's word that he be respond to order and query from his own ground control

 here be a brief segment of the tape which we be go to play in its entirety for the united nations security council tomorrow

 those be the voice of the soviet pilot in this tape the pilot who fire the missile describe his search for what he call the target he report he have it in sight indeed he pull up to within about a mile of the korean plane mention its flash strobe light and that its navigation light be on he then report he be reduce speed to get behind the airliner give his distance from the plane at various point in this maneuver and finally announce what can only be call the korean airline massacre he say he have lock on the radar which aim his missile have launch those missile the target have be destroy and he be break off the attack

 let i point out something here have to do with his close up view of the airliner on what we know be a clear night with a half moon the 747 have a unique and distinctive silhouette unlike any other plane in the world there be no way a pilot could mistake this for anything other than a civilian airliner and if that be not enough let i point out our rc-135 that i mention early have be back at its base in alaska on the ground for an hour when the murderous attack take place over the sea of japan

 and make no mistake about it this attack be not just against ourselves or the republic of korea this be the soviet union against the world and the moral precept which guide human relation among people everywhere it be an act of barbarism bear of a society which wantonly disregard individual right and the value of human life and seek constantly to expand and dominate other nation

 they deny the deed but in their conflict and misleading protestation the soviets reveal that yes shoot down a plane even one with hundred of innocent man woman child and baby be a part of their normal procedure if that plane be in what they claim as their airspace

 they owe the world an apology and an offer to join the rest of the world in work out a system to protect against this ever happen again among the rest of we there be one protective measure an international radio wavelength on which pilot can communicate with plane of other nation if they be in trouble or lose soviet military plane be not so equipped because that would make it easy for pilot who might want to defect

 our request to send vessel into soviet water to search for wreckage and body have receive no satisfactory answer bereaved family of the japanese victim be harass by soviet patrol boat when they try to get near where the plane be believe to have go down in order to hold a ceremony for their dead but we should not be surprise by such inhuman brutality memory come back of czechoslovakia hungary poland the gassing of village in afghanistan if the massacre and their subsequent conduct be intend to intimidate they have fail in their purpose from every corner of the globe the word be defiance in the face of this unspeakable act and defiance of the system which excuse it and try to cover it up with our horror and our sorrow there be a righteous and terrible anger it would be easy to think in term of vengeance but that be not a proper answer we want justice and action to see that this never happen again

 our immediate challenge to this atrocity be to ensure that we make the sky safe and that we seek just compensation for the family of those who be kill

 since my return to washington we have hold long meeting the most recent yesterday with the congressional leadership there be a feeling of unity in the room and i receive a number of constructive suggestion we will continue to work with the congress regard our response to this massacre

 as you know we immediately make known to the world the shocking fact as honestly and completely as they come to we

 we have notify the soviets that we will not renew our bilateral agreement for cooperation in the field of transportation so long as they threaten the security of civil aviation

 since 1981 the soviet airline aeroflot have be deny the right to fly to the united states we have reaffirm that order and be examine additional step we can take with regard to aeroflot facility in this country we be cooperate with other country to find well mean to ensure the safety of civil aviation and to join we in not accept aeroflot as a normal member of the international civil air community unless and until the soviets satisfy the cry of humanity for justice i be pleased to report that canada today suspend aeroflot 's landing and refueling privilege for 60 day

 we have join with other country to press the international civil aviation organization to investigate this crime at an urgent special session of the council at the same time we be listen most carefully to private group both american and international airline pilot passenger association and other who have a special interest in civil air safety

 i be ask the congress to pass a joint resolution of condemnation of this soviet crime

 we have inform the soviets that we be suspend negotiation on several bilateral arrangement we have under consideration

 along with korea and japan we call an emergency meeting of the u.n. security council which begin on friday on that first day korea japan canada australia the netherlands pakistan france china the united kingdom zaire new zealand and west germany all join we in denounce the soviet action and express our horror we expect to hear from additional country as debate resume tomorrow

 we intend to work with the 13 country who have citizen aboard the korean airliner to seek reparation for the family of all those who be kill the united states will be make a claim against the soviet union within the next week to obtain compensation for the benefit of the victim survivor such compensation be an absolute moral duty which the soviets must assume

 in the economic area in general we be redouble our effort with our ally to end the flow of military and strategic item to the soviet union

 secretary shultz be go to madrid to meet with representative of 35 country who for 3 year have be negotiate an agreement have to do with among other thing human right foreign minister gromyko of the soviet union be schedule to attend that meeting if he do come to the meeting secretary shultz be go to present he with our demand for disclosure of the fact corrective action and concrete assurance that such a thing will not happen again and that restitution be make

 as we work with other country to see that justice be do the real test of our resolve be whether we have the will to remain strong steady and unite i believe more than ever as evidence by your thousand and thousand of wire and phone call in these last few day that we do

 i have outline some of the step we be take in response to the tragic massacre there be something i have always believe in but which now seem more important than ever the congress will be face key national security issue when it return from recess there have be legitimate difference of opinion on this subject i know but i urge the member of that distinguished body to ponder long and hard the soviets aggression as they consider the security and safety of our people indeed all people who believe in freedom

 senator henry jackson a wise and revered statesman and one who probably understand the soviets as well as any american in history warn we the great threat the united states now face be pose by the soviet union but senator jackson say if america maintain a strong deterrent and only if it do this nation will continue to be a leader in the crucial quest for endure peace among nation

 the late senator make those statement in july on the senate floor speak in behalf of the mx missile program he consider vital to restore america 's strategic parity with the soviets

 when john f. kennedy be president defense spending as a share of the federal budget be 70 percent great than it be today since then the soviet union have carry on the most massive military buildup the world have ever see until they be willing to join the rest of the world community we must maintain the strength to deter their aggression

 but while we do so we must not give up our effort to bring they into the world community of nation peace through strength as long as necessary but never give up our effort to bring peace close through mutual verifiable reduction in the weapon of war

 i have tell you of negotiation we have suspend as a result of the korean airline massacre but we can not we must not give up our effort to reduce the arsenal of destructive weapon threaten the world ambassador nitze have return to geneva to resume the negotiation on intermediate range nuclear weapon in europe equally we will continue to press for arm reduction in the start talk that resume in october we be more determined than ever to reduce and if possible eliminate the threat hang over mankind

 we know it will be hard to make a nation that rule its own people through force to cease use force against the rest of the world but we must try

 this be not a role we seek we preach no manifest destiny but like americans who begin this country and bring forth this last good hope of mankind history have ask much of the americans of our own time much we have already give much more we must be prepare to give

 let we have faith in abraham lincoln 's word that right make might and in that faith let we to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it if we do if we stand together and move forward with courage then history will record that some good do come from this monstrous wrong that we will carry with we and remember for the rest of our life

 thank you god bless you and good night







 my fellow americans

 some 2 month ago we be shock by the brutal massacre of 269 man woman and child more than 60 of they americans in the shooting down of a korean airliner now in these past several day violence have erupt again in lebanon and grenada

 in lebanon we have some 1,600 marine part of a multinational force that be try to help the people of lebanon restore order and stability to that troubled land our marine be assign to the south of the city of beirut near the only airport operate in lebanon just a mile or so to the north be the italian contingent and not far from they the french and a company of british soldier

 this past sunday at 22 minute after 6 beirut time with dawn just break a truck look like a lot of other vehicle in the city approach the airport on a busy main road there be nothing in its appearance to suggest it be any different than the truck or car that be normally see on and around the airport but this one be different at the wheel be a young man on a suicide mission

 the truck carry some 2,000 pound of explosive but there be no way our marine guard could know this their first warning that something be wrong come when the truck crash through a series of barrier include a chain link fence and barbed wire entanglement the guard open fire but it be too late the truck smash through the door of the headquarters building in which our marine be sleep and instantly explode the four story concrete building collapse in a pile of rubble

 more than 200 of the sleep man be kill in that one hideous insane attack many other suffer injury and be hospitalize here or in europe

 this be not the end of the horror at almost the same instant another vehicle on a suicide and murder mission crash into the headquarters of the french peacekeeping force an eight story building destroy it and kill more than 50 french soldier

 prior to this day of horror there have be several tragedy for our man in the multinational force attack by sniper and mortar fire have take their toll

 i call bereaved parent and/or widow of the victim to express on behalf of all of we our sorrow and sympathy sometimes there be question and now many of you be ask why should our young man be die in lebanon why be lebanon important to we

 well it be true lebanon be a small country more than five and a half thousand mile from our shore on the edge of what we call the middle east but every president who have occupy this office in recent year have recognize that peace in the middle east be of vital concern to our nation and indeed to our ally in western europe and japan we have be concern because the middle east be a powderkeg four time in the last 30 year the arabs and israelis have go to war and each time the world have teeter near the edge of catastrophe

 the area be key to the economic and political life of the west its strategic importance its energy resource the suez canal and the well being of the nearly 200 million people live there all be vital to we and to world peace if that key should fall into the hand of a power or power hostile to the free world there would be a direct threat to the united states and to our ally

 we have another reason to be involve since 1948 our nation have recognize and accept a moral obligation to assure the continued existence of israel as a nation israel share our democratic value and be a formidable force an invader of the middle east would have to reckon with

 for several year lebanon have be tear by internal strife once a prosperous peaceful nation its government have become ineffective in control the militia that war on each other sixteen month ago we be watch on our tv screen the shelling and bombing of beirut which be be use as a fortress by plo band hundred and hundred of civilian be be kill and wound in the daily battle

 syria which make no secret of its claim that lebanon should be a part of a greater syria be occupy a large part of lebanon today syria have become a home for 7,000 soviet adviser and technician who man a massive amount of soviet weaponry include ss-21 ground to ground missile capable of reach vital area of israel

 a little over a year ago hope to build on the camp david accord which have lead to peace between israel and egypt i propose a peace plan for the middle east to end the war between the arab states and israel it be base on u.n. resolution 242 and 338 and call for a fair and just solution to the palestinian problem as well as a fair and just settlement of issue between the arab states and israel

 before the necessary negotiation could begin it be essential to get all foreign force out of lebanon and to end the fighting there so why be we there well the answer be straightforward to help bring peace to lebanon and stability to the vital middle east to that end the multinational force be create to help stabilize the situation in lebanon until a government could be establish and a lebanese army mobilize to restore lebanese sovereignty over its own soil as the foreign force withdraw israel agree to withdraw as do syria but syria then renege on its promise over 10,000 palestinians who have be bring ruin down on beirut however do leave the country

 lebanon have form a government under the leadership of president gemayal and that government with our assistance and training have set up its own army in only a year 's time that army have be rebuild it be a good army compose of lebanese of all faction

 a few week ago the israeli army pull back to the awali river in southern lebanon despite fierce resistance by syrian back force the lebanese army be able to hold the line and maintain the defensive perimeter around beirut

 in the year that our marine have be there lebanon have make important step toward stability and order the physical presence of the marine lend support to both the lebanese government and its army it allow the hard work of diplomacy to go forward indeed without the peacekeeper from the u.s. france italy and britain the effort to find a peaceful solution in lebanon would collapse

 as to that narrow question what exactly be the operational mission of the marines the answer be to secure a piece of beirut to keep order in their sector and to prevent the area from become a battlefield our marine be not just sit in an airport part of their task be to guard that airport because of their presence the airport have remain operational in addition they patrol the surround area this be their part a limited but essential part in the large effort that i have describe

 if our marine must be there i be ask why can not we make they safe who commit this late atrocity against they and why

 well we will do everything we can to ensure that our man be as safe as possible we order the battleship new jersey to join our naval force offshore without even fire they the threat of its 16 inch gun silence those who once fire down on our marine from the hill and they be a good part of the reason we suddenly have a ceasefire we be do our good to make our force less vulnerable to those who want to snipe at they or send in future suicide mission

 secretary shultz call i today from europe where he be meet with the foreign ministers of our ally in the multinational force they remain committed to our task and plan be make to share information as to how we can improve security for all our man

 we have strong circumstantial evidence that the attack on the marine be direct by terrorist who use the same method to destroy our embassy in beirut those who direct this atrocity must be deal justice and they will be the obvious purpose behind the sniping and now this attack be to weaken american will and force the withdrawal of u.s. and french force from lebanon the clear intent of the terrorist be to eliminate our support of the lebanese government and to destroy the ability of the lebanese people to determine their own destiny

 to answer those who ask if we be serve any purpose in be there let i answer a question with a question would the terrorist have launch their suicide attack against the multinational force if it be not do its job the multinational force be attack precisely because it be do the job it be send to do in beirut it be accomplish its mission

 now then where do we go from here what can we do now to help lebanon gain great stability so that our marine can come home well i believe we can take three step now that will make a difference

 first we will accelerate the search for peace and stability in that region little attention have be pay to the fact that we have have special envoy there work literally around the clock to bring the war faction together this come monday in geneva president gemayel of lebanon will sit down with other faction from his country to see if national reconciliation can be achieve he have our firm support i will soon be announce a replacement for bud mcfarlane who be precede by phil habib both work tirelessly and must be credit for much if not most of the progress we have make

 second we will work even more closely with our ally in provide support for the government of lebanon and for the rebuilding of a national consensus

 third we will ensure that the multinational peace keep force our marine be give the great possible protection our commandant of the marine corps general kelley return from lebanon today and will be advise we on step we can take to improve security vice president bush return just last night from beirut and give i a full report of his brief visit

 beyond our progress in lebanon let we remember that our main goal and purpose be to achieve a broad peace in all of the middle east the faction and bitterness that we see in lebanon be just a microcosm of the difficulty that be spread across much of that region a peace initiative for the entire middle east consistent with the camp david accord and u.n. resolution 242 and 338 still offer the good hope for bring peace to the region

 let i ask those who say we should get out of lebanon if we be to leave lebanon now what message would that send to those who foment instability and terrorism if america be to walk away from lebanon what chance would there be for a negotiate settlement produce a unified democratic lebanon

 if we turn our back on lebanon now what would be the future of israel at stake be the fate of only the second arab country to negotiate a major agreement with israel that be another accomplishment of this past year the may 17th accord sign by lebanon and israel

 if terrorism and intimidation succeed it will be a devastating blow to the peace process and to israel 's search for genuine security it will not just be lebanon sentence to a future of chaos can the united states or the free world for that matter stand by and see the middle east incorporate into the soviet bloc what of western europe and japan 's dependence on middle east oil for the energy to fuel their industry the middle east be as i have say vital to our national security and economic well being

 brave young man have be take from we many other have be grievously wound be we to tell they their sacrifice be waste they give their life in defense of our national security every bit as much as any man who ever die fight in a war we must not strip every ounce of meaning and purpose from their courageous sacrifice

 we be a nation with global responsibility we be not somewhere else in the world protect someone else 's interest we be there protect our own

 i receive a message from the father of a marine in lebanon he tell i in a world where we speak of human right there be a sad lack of acceptance of responsibility my son have choose the acceptance of responsibility for the privilege of live in this country certainly in this country one do not inherently have right unless the responsibility for these right be accept dr. kenneth morrison say that while he be wait to learn if his son be one of the dead i be thrill for he to learn today that his son ross be alive and well and carry on his duty in lebanon

 let we meet our responsibility for long than any of we can remember the people of the middle east have live from war to war with no prospect for any other future that dreadful cycle must be break why be we there well a lebanese mother tell one of our ambassadors that her little girl have only attend school 2 of the last 8 year now because of our presence there she say her daughter could live a normal life

 with patience and firmness we can help bring peace to that strife tear region and make our own life more secure our role be to help the lebanese put their country together not to do it for they

 now i know another part of the world be very much on our mind a place much close to our shore grenada the island be only twice the size of the district of columbia with a total population of about 110,000 people

 grenada and a half dozen other caribbean island here be until recently british colony they be now independent state and member of the british commonwealth while they respect each other 's independence they also feel a kinship with each other and think of themselves as one people

 in 1979 trouble come to grenada maurice bishop a protege of fidel castro stage a military coup and overthrow the government which have be elect under the constitution leave to the people by the british he seek the help of cuba in build an airport which he claim be for tourist trade but which look suspiciously suitable for military aircraft include soviet build long range bomber

 the six sovereign country and one remain colony be join together in what they call the organization of eastern caribbean states the six become increasingly alarmed as bishop build an army great than all of theirs combine obviously it be not purely for defense

 in this last year or so prime minister bishop give indication that he might like well relation with the united states he even make a trip to our country and meet with senior official of the white house and the state department whether he be serious or not we will never know on october 12th a small group in his militia seize he and put he under arrest they be if anything more radical and more devoted to castro 's cuba than he have be

 several day later a crowd of citizen appear before bishop 's home free he and escort he toward the headquarters of the military council they be fire upon a number include some child be kill and bishop be seize he and several member of his cabinet be subsequently execute and a 24 hour shoot to kill curfew be put in effect grenada be without a government its only authority exercise by a self proclaim band of military man

 there be then about 1,000 of our citizen on grenada 800 of they student in st. george 's university medical school concerned that they would be harm or hold as hostage i order a flotilla of ship then on its way to lebanon with marine part of our regular rotation program to circle south on a course that would put they somewhere in the vicinity of grenada in case there should be a need to evacuate our people

 last weekend i be awaken in the early morning hour and tell that six member of the organization of eastern caribbean states join by jamaica and barbados have send an urgent request that we join they in a military operation to restore order and democracy to grenada they be propose this action under the term of a treaty a mutual assistance pact that exist among they

 these small peaceful nation need our help three of they do not have army at all and the other have very limit force the legitimacy of their request plus my own concern for our citizen dictate my decision i believe our government have a responsibility to go to the aid of its citizen if their right to life and liberty be threaten the nightmare of our hostage in iran must never be repeat

 we know we have little time and that complete secrecy be vital to ensure both the safety of the young man who would undertake this mission and the americans they be about to rescue the joint chiefs work around the clock to come up with a plan they have little intelligence information about condition on the island

 we have to assume that several hundred cubans work on the airport could be military reserve well as it turn out the number be much large and they be a military force six hundred of they have be take prisoner and we have discover a complete base with weapon and communication equipment which make it clear a cuban occupation of the island have be plan

 two hour ago we release the first photo from grenada they include picture of a warehouse of military equipment one of three we have uncover so far this warehouse contain weapon and ammunition stack almost to the ceiling enough to supply thousand of terrorist grenada we be tell be a friendly island paradise for tourism well it be not it be a soviet cuban colony be readie as a major military bastion to export terror and undermine democracy we get there just in time

 i can not say enough in praise of our military army ranger and paratrooper navy marine and air force personnel those who plan a brilliant campaign and those who carry it out almost instantly our military seize the two airport secure the campus where most of our student be and be now in the mopping up phase

 it should be note that in all the planning a top priority be to minimize risk to avoid casualty to our own man and also the grenadian force as much as humanly possible but there be casualty and we all owe a debt to those who lose their life or be wound they be few in number but even one be a tragic price to pay

 it be our intention to get our man out as soon as possible prime minister eugenia charles of dominica i call that wrong she pronounce it dominica she be chairman of oecs she be call for help from commonwealth nation in give the people their right to establish a constitutional government on grenada we anticipate that the governor general a grenadian will participate in set up a provisional government in the interim

 the event in lebanon and grenada though ocean apart be closely related not only have moscow assist and encourage the violence in both country but it provide direct support through a network of surrogate and terrorist it be no coincidence that when the thug try to wrest control over grenada there be 30 soviet adviser and hundred of cuban military and paramilitary force on the island at the moment of our landing we communicate with the government of cuba and the soviet union and tell they we would offer shelter and security to their people on grenada regrettably castro order his man to fight to the death and some do the other will be send to their homeland

 you know there be a time when our national security be base on a stand army here within our own border and shore battery of artillery along our coast and of course a navy to keep the sealane open for the shipping of thing necessary to our well being the world have change today our national security can be threaten in faraway place it be up to all of we to be aware of the strategic importance of such place and to be able to identify they

 sam rayburn once say that freedom be not something a nation can work for once and win forever he say it be like an insurance policy its premium must be keep up to date in order to keep it we have to keep work for it and sacrifice for it just as long as we live if we do not our child may not know the pleasure of work to keep it for it may not be theirs to keep

 in these last few day i have be more sure than i have ever be that we americans of today will keep freedom and maintain peace i have be make to feel that by the magnificent spirit of our young man and woman in uniform and by something here in our nation 's capital in this city where political strife be so much a part of our life i have see democratic leader in the congress join their republican colleague send a message to the world that we be all americans before we be anything else and when our country be threaten we stand shoulder to shoulder in support of our man and woman in the armed forces

 may i share something with you i think you would like to know it be something that happen to the commandant of our marine corps general paul kelley while he be visit our critically injure marine in an air force hospital it say more than any of we could ever hope to say about the gallantry and heroism of these young man young man who serve so willingly so that other might have a chance at peace and freedom in their own life and in the life of their country

 i will let general kelley 's word describe the incident he speak of a young marine with more tube go in and out of his body than i have ever see in one body

 he could not see very well he reach up and grab my four star just to make sure i be who i say i be he hold my hand with a firm grip he be make signal and we realize he want to tell i something we put a pad of paper in his hand and he write semper fi

 well if you have be a marine or if like myself you be an admirer of the marine you know those word be a battle cry a greeting and a legend in the marine corps they be marine shorthand for the motto of the corps—"semper fidelis"—"always faithful

 general kelley have a reputation for be a very sophisticated general and a very tough marine but he cry when he see those word and who can blame he

 that marine and all those other like he living and dead have be faithful to their ideal they have give willingly of themselves so that a nearly defenseless people in a region of great strategic importance to the free world will have a chance someday to live life free of murder and mayhem and terrorism i think that young marine and all of his comrade have give every one of we something to live up to

 they be not afraid to stand up for their country or no matter how difficult and slow the journey might be to give to other that last good hope of a well future we can not and will not dishonor they now and the sacrifice they have make by fail to remain as faithful to the cause of freedom and the pursuit of peace as they have be

 i will not ask you to pray for the dead because they be safe in god 's love arm and beyond need of our prayer i would like to ask you all wherever you may be in this bless land to pray for these wound young man and to pray for the bereaved family of those who give their life for our freedom

 god bless you and god bless america

 secretary shultz call i today from europe where he be meet with the foreign ministers of our ally in the multinational force they remain committed to our task and plan be make to share information as to how we can improve security for all our man

 we have strong circumstantial evidence that the attack on the marine be direct by terrorist who use the same method to destroy our embassy in beirut those who direct this atrocity must be deal justice and they will be the obvious purpose behind the sniping and now this attack be to weaken american will and force the withdrawal of u.s. and french force from lebanon the clear intent of the terrorist be to eliminate our support of the lebanese government and to destroy the ability of the lebanese people to determine their own destiny

 to answer those who ask if we be serve any purpose in be there let i answer a question with a question would the terrorist have launch their suicide attack against the multinational force if it be not do its job the multinational force be attack precisely because it be do the job it be send to do in beirut it be accomplish its mission

 now then where do we go from here what can we do now to help lebanon gain great stability so that our marine can come home well i believe we can take three step now that will make a difference

 first we will accelerate the search for peace and stability in that region little attention have be pay to the fact that we have have special envoy there work literally around the clock to bring the war faction together this come monday in geneva president gemayel of lebanon will sit down with other faction from his country to see if national reconciliation can be achieve he have our firm support i will soon be announce a replacement for bud mcfarlane who be precede by phil habib both work tirelessly and must be credit for much if not most of the progress we have make

 second we will work even more closely with our ally in provide support for the government of lebanon and for the rebuilding of a national consensus

 third we will ensure that the multinational peace keep force our marine be give the great possible protection our commandant of the marine corps general kelley return from lebanon today and will be advise we on step we can take to improve security vice president bush return just last night from beirut and give i a full report of his brief visit

 beyond our progress in lebanon let we remember that our main goal and purpose be to achieve a broad peace in all of the middle east the faction and bitterness that we see in lebanon be just a microcosm of the difficulty that be spread across much of that region a peace initiative for the entire middle east consistent with the camp david accord and u.n. resolution 242 and 338 still offer the good hope for bring peace to the region

 let i ask those who say we should get out of lebanon if we be to leave lebanon now what message would that send to those who foment instability and terrorism if america be to walk away from lebanon what chance would there be for a negotiate settlement produce a unified democratic lebanon

 if we turn our back on lebanon now what would be the future of israel at stake be the fate of only the second arab country to negotiate a major agreement with israel that be another accomplishment of this past year the may 17th accord sign by lebanon and israel

 if terrorism and intimidation succeed it will be a devastating blow to the peace process and to israel 's search for genuine security it will not just be lebanon sentence to a future of chaos can the united states or the free world for that matter stand by and see the middle east incorporate into the soviet bloc what of western europe and japan 's dependence on middle east oil for the energy to fuel their industry the middle east be as i have say vital to our national security and economic well being

 brave young man have be take from we many other have be grievously wound be we to tell they their sacrifice be waste they give their life in defense of our national security every bit as much as any man who ever die fight in a war we must not strip every ounce of meaning and purpose from their courageous sacrifice

 we be a nation with global responsibility we be not somewhere else in the world protect someone else 's interest we be there protect our own

 i receive a message from the father of a marine in lebanon he tell i in a world where we speak of human right there be a sad lack of acceptance of responsibility my son have choose the acceptance of responsibility for the privilege of live in this country certainly in this country one do not inherently have right unless the responsibility for these right be accept dr. kenneth morrison say that while he be wait to learn if his son be one of the dead i be thrill for he to learn today that his son ross be alive and well and carry on his duty in lebanon

 let we meet our responsibility for long than any of we can remember the people of the middle east have live from war to war with no prospect for any other future that dreadful cycle must be break why be we there well a lebanese mother tell one of our ambassadors that her little girl have only attend school 2 of the last 8 year now because of our presence there she say her daughter could live a normal life

 with patience and firmness we can help bring peace to that strife tear region and make our own life more secure our role be to help the lebanese put their country together not to do it for they

 now i know another part of the world be very much on our mind a place much close to our shore grenada the island be only twice the size of the district of columbia with a total population of about 110,000 people

 grenada and a half dozen other caribbean island here be until recently british colony they be now independent state and member of the british commonwealth while they respect each other 's independence they also feel a kinship with each other and think of themselves as one people

 in 1979 trouble come to grenada maurice bishop a protege of fidel castro stage a military coup and overthrow the government which have be elect under the constitution leave to the people by the british he seek the help of cuba in build an airport which he claim be for tourist trade but which look suspiciously suitable for military aircraft include soviet build long range bomber

 the six sovereign country and one remain colony be join together in what they call the organization of eastern caribbean states the six become increasingly alarmed as bishop build an army great than all of theirs combine obviously it be not purely for defense

 in this last year or so prime minister bishop give indication that he might like well relation with the united states he even make a trip to our country and meet with senior official of the white house and the state department whether he be serious or not we will never know on october 12th a small group in his militia seize he and put he under arrest they be if anything more radical and more devoted to castro 's cuba than he have be

 several day later a crowd of citizen appear before bishop 's home free he and escort he toward the headquarters of the military council they be fire upon a number include some child be kill and bishop be seize he and several member of his cabinet be subsequently execute and a 24 hour shoot to kill curfew be put in effect grenada be without a government its only authority exercise by a self proclaim band of military man

 there be then about 1,000 of our citizen on grenada 800 of they student in st. george 's university medical school concerned that they would be harm or hold as hostage i order a flotilla of ship then on its way to lebanon with marine part of our regular rotation program to circle south on a course that would put they somewhere in the vicinity of grenada in case there should be a need to evacuate our people

 last weekend i be awaken in the early morning hour and tell that six member of the organization of eastern caribbean states join by jamaica and barbados have send an urgent request that we join they in a military operation to restore order and democracy to grenada they be propose this action under the term of a treaty a mutual assistance pact that exist among they

 these small peaceful nation need our help three of they do not have army at all and the other have very limit force the legitimacy of their request plus my own concern for our citizen dictate my decision i believe our government have a responsibility to go to the aid of its citizen if their right to life and liberty be threaten the nightmare of our hostage in iran must never be repeat

 we know we have little time and that complete secrecy be vital to ensure both the safety of the young man who would undertake this mission and the americans they be about to rescue the joint chiefs work around the clock to come up with a plan they have little intelligence information about condition on the island

 we have to assume that several hundred cubans work on the airport could be military reserve well as it turn out the number be much large and they be a military force six hundred of they have be take prisoner and we have discover a complete base with weapon and communication equipment which make it clear a cuban occupation of the island have be plan

 two hour ago we release the first photo from grenada they include picture of a warehouse of military equipment one of three we have uncover so far this warehouse contain weapon and ammunition stack almost to the ceiling enough to supply thousand of terrorist grenada we be tell be a friendly island paradise for tourism well it be not it be a soviet cuban colony be readie as a major military bastion to export terror and undermine democracy we get there just in time

 i can not say enough in praise of our military army ranger and paratrooper navy marine and air force personnel those who plan a brilliant campaign and those who carry it out almost instantly our military seize the two airport secure the campus where most of our student be and be now in the mopping up phase

 it should be note that in all the planning a top priority be to minimize risk to avoid casualty to our own man and also the grenadian force as much as humanly possible but there be casualty and we all owe a debt to those who lose their life or be wound they be few in number but even one be a tragic price to pay

 it be our intention to get our man out as soon as possible prime minister eugenia charles of dominica i call that wrong she pronounce it dominica she be chairman of oecs she be call for help from commonwealth nation in give the people their right to establish a constitutional government on grenada we anticipate that the governor general a grenadian will participate in set up a provisional government in the interim

 the event in lebanon and grenada though ocean apart be closely related not only have moscow assist and encourage the violence in both country but it provide direct support through a network of surrogate and terrorist it be no coincidence that when the thug try to wrest control over grenada there be 30 soviet adviser and hundred of cuban military and paramilitary force on the island at the moment of our landing we communicate with the government of cuba and the soviet union and tell they we would offer shelter and security to their people on grenada regrettably castro order his man to fight to the death and some do the other will be send to their homeland

 you know there be a time when our national security be base on a stand army here within our own border and shore battery of artillery along our coast and of course a navy to keep the sealane open for the shipping of thing necessary to our well being the world have change today our national security can be threaten in faraway place it be up to all of we to be aware of the strategic importance of such place and to be able to identify they

 sam rayburn once say that freedom be not something a nation can work for once and win forever he say it be like an insurance policy its premium must be keep up to date in order to keep it we have to keep work for it and sacrifice for it just as long as we live if we do not our child may not know the pleasure of work to keep it for it may not be theirs to keep

 in these last few day i have be more sure than i have ever be that we americans of today will keep freedom and maintain peace i have be make to feel that by the magnificent spirit of our young man and woman in uniform and by something here in our nation 's capital in this city where political strife be so much a part of our life i have see democratic leader in the congress join their republican colleague send a message to the world that we be all americans before we be anything else and when our country be threaten we stand shoulder to shoulder in support of our man and woman in the armed forces

 may i share something with you i think you would like to know it be something that happen to the commandant of our marine corps general paul kelley while he be visit our critically injure marine in an air force hospital it say more than any of we could ever hope to say about the gallantry and heroism of these young man young man who serve so willingly so that other might have a chance at peace and freedom in their own life and in the life of their country

 i will let general kelley 's word describe the incident he speak of a young marine with more tube go in and out of his body than i have ever see in one body

 he could not see very well he reach up and grab my four star just to make sure i be who i say i be he hold my hand with a firm grip he be make signal and we realize he want to tell i something we put a pad of paper in his hand and he write semper fi

 well if you have be a marine or if like myself you be an admirer of the marine you know those word be a battle cry a greeting and a legend in the marine corps they be marine shorthand for the motto of the corps—"semper fidelis"—"always faithful

 general kelley have a reputation for be a very sophisticated general and a very tough marine but he cry when he see those word and who can blame he

 that marine and all those other like he living and dead have be faithful to their ideal they have give willingly of themselves so that a nearly defenseless people in a region of great strategic importance to the free world will have a chance someday to live life free of murder and mayhem and terrorism i think that young marine and all of his comrade have give every one of we something to live up to

 they be not afraid to stand up for their country or no matter how difficult and slow the journey might be to give to other that last good hope of a well future we can not and will not dishonor they now and the sacrifice they have make by fail to remain as faithful to the cause of freedom and the pursuit of peace as they have be

 i will not ask you to pray for the dead because they be safe in god 's love arm and beyond need of our prayer i would like to ask you all wherever you may be in this bless land to pray for these wound young man and to pray for the bereaved family of those who give their life for our freedom

 god bless you and god bless america





mrs. king member of the king family distinguished members of the congress lady and gentleman honored guest i be very pleased to welcome you to the white house the home that belong to all of we the american people

 when i be think of the contribution to our country of the man that we be honor today a passage attribute to the american poet john greenleaf whittier come to mind each crisis bring its word and deed in america in the fifty and sixty one of the important crisis we face be racial discrimination the man whose word and deed in that crisis stir our nation to the very depth of its soul be dr. martin luther king jr.

 martin luther king be bear in 1929 in an america where because of the color of their skin nearly 1 in 10 live life that be separate and unequal most black americans be teach in segregated school across the country too many could find only poor job toil for low wage they be refuse entry into hotel and restaurant make to use separate facility in a nation that proclaim liberty and justice for all too many black americans be live with neither

 in one city a rule require all black to sit in the rear of public bus but in 1955 when a brave woman name rosa parks be tell to move to the back of the bus she say no a young minister in a local baptist church martin luther king then organize a boycott of the bus company a boycott that stun the country within 6 month the court have rule the segregation of public transportation unconstitutional

 dr. king have awaken something strong and true a sense that true justice must be colorblind and that among white and black americans as he put it their destiny be tie up with our destiny and their freedom be inextricably bind to our freedom we can not walk alone

 in the year after the bus boycott dr. king make equality of right his life 's work across the country he organize boycott rally and marche often he be beat imprison but he never stop teach nonviolence work with the faith he tell his follower that unearned suffering be redemptive in 1964 dr. king become the young man in history to win the nobel peace prize

 dr. king 's work bring he to this city often and in one swelter august day in 1963 he address a quarter of a million people at the lincoln memorial if american history grow from two century to twenty his word that day will never be forget i have a dream that one day on the red hill of georgia the son of former slave and the son of former slave owner will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood

 in 1968 martin luther king be gun down by a brutal assassin his life cut short at the age of 39 but those 39 short year have change america forever the civil rights act of 1964 have guarantee all americans equal use of public accommodation equal access to program finance by federal fund and the right to compete for employment on the sole basis of individual merit the voting rights act of 1965 have make certain that from then on black americans would get to vote but most important there be not just a change of law there be a change of heart the conscience of america have be touch across the land people have begin to treat each other not as black and white but as fellow americans

 and since dr. king 's death his father the reverend martin luther king sr and his wife coretta king have eloquently and forcefully carry on his work also his family have join in that cause

 now our nation have decide to honor dr. martin luther king jr. by set aside a day each year to remember he and the just cause he stand for we have make historic stride since rosa parks refuse to go to the back of the bus as a democratic people we can take pride in the knowledge that we americans recognize a grave injustice and take action to correct it and we should remember that in far too many country people like dr. king never have the opportunity to speak out at all

 but trace of bigotry still mar america so each year on martin luther king day let we not only recall dr. king but rededicate ourselves to the commandments he believe in and seek to live every day thou shall love thy god with all thy heart and thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself and i just have to believe that all of we if all of we young and old republicans and democrats do all we can to live up to those commandment then we will see the day when dr. king 's dream come true and in his word all of god 's child will be able to sing with new meaning land where my father die land of the pilgrim 's pride from every mountainside let freedom ring

 thank you god bless you and i will sign it

officer and man and woman of the corps lady and gentleman i come here today to pay homage to the hero of lebanon and grenada we grieve along with the family of these brave proud americans who have give their life for their country and for the preservation of peace

 in the middle east this morning we have learn of yet another terrorist assault similar to the attack against our marine this time against an israeli site in tyre lebanon

 in spite of the complexity and special hardship of the lebanese crisis we have stand firm as ever leatherneck be willing to accept their mission and do their duty this honest patriotism and dedication to duty overwhelm the rest of we

 in grenada our military force move quickly and professionally to protect american life and respond to an urgent request from the organization of eastern caribbean states we join in an effort to restore order and democracy to that strife tear island only day before our action prime minister maurice bishop have be brutally murder along with several member of his cabinet and unarmed civilian with a thousand americans include some 800 student on that island we be not about to wait for the iran crisis to repeat itself only this time in our own neighborhood the caribbean

 in a free society there be bind to be disagreement about any decisive course of action some of those so quick to criticize our operation in grenada i invite they to read the letter i have receive from those student and their family they know this be no invasion they know it be a rescue mission marine have a saying—"we take care of our own well america with the help of marine will take care of our own and our brave marine soldier and special force include the truly gallant navy seals be not just come to the aid of our student i hope every american will be able to hear the story of the political prisoner who have be free the citizen of grenada who watch helplessly as their country be be steal from they and turn into a staging area for totalitarian aggression these same grenadians be hail we as liberator and they be do everything they can now to help every american can be proud of the professional and gallant job that our armed forces have do and all of we can rejoice that they be come home

 i come here today to honor so many who do their duty and give that last full measure of their devotion they keep faith with we and our way of life we would not be free long but for the dedication of such individual they be hero we be grateful to have have they with we

 one of the man in the early day of our nation john stuart mill say war be an ugly thing but not the ugly of thing the ugly be that man who think nothing be worth fight or die for and let man well and braver than himself protect he you be do that for all of we

 god bless you and thank you for what you be do

mr. speaker mr. president distinguished member of the congress honored guest and fellow citizen

 once again in keep with time honor tradition i have come to report to you on the state of the union and i be pleased to report that america be much improve and there be good reason to believe that improvement will continue through the day to come

 you and i have have some honest and open difference in the year past but they do not keep we from join hand in bipartisan cooperation to stop a long decline that have drain this nation 's spirit and erode its health there be renew energy and optimism throughout the land america be back stand tall look to the 80 with courage confidence and hope

 the problem we be overcome be not the heritage of one person party or even one generation it be just the tendency of government to grow for practice and program to become the near thing to eternal life we will ever see on this earth laughter and there be always that well intentione chorus of voice say with a little more power and a little more money we could do so much for the people for a time we forget the american dream be not one of make government big it be keep faith with the mighty spirit of free people under god

 as we come to the decade of the 80 we face the bad crisis in our postwar history in the 70 be year of rise problem and fall confidence there be a feeling government have grow beyond the consent of the governed family feel helpless in the face of mount inflation and the indignity of taxis that reduce reward for hard work thrift and risktaking all this be overlay by an evergrowing web of rule and regulation

 on the international scene we have an uncomfortable feeling that we would lose the respect of friend and foe some question whether we have the will to defend peace and freedom but america be too great for small dream there be a hunger in the land for a spiritual revival if you will a crusade for renewal the american people say let we look to the future with confidence both at home and abroad let we give freedom a chance

 americans be ready to make a new beginning and together we have do it we be confront our problem one by one hope be alive tonight for million of young family and senior citizen set free from unfair tax increase and crush inflation inflation have be beat down from 12.4 to 3.2 percent and that be a great victory for all the people the prime rate have be cut almost in half and we must work together to bring it down even more

 together we pass the first across the board tax reduction for everyone since the kennedy tax cut next year tax rate will be index so inflation can not push people into high bracket when they get cost of living pay raise government must never again use inflation to profit at the people 's expense

 today a work family earn $ 25,000 have $ 1,100 more in purchase power than if tax and inflation rate be still at the 1980 level real after tax income increase 5 percent last year and economic deregulation of key industry like transportation have offer more chance or choice i should say to consumer and new change or chance for entrepreneur and protect safety tonight we can report and be proud of one of the good recovery in decade send away the handwringer and the doubt thomases hope be reborn for couple dream of own home and for risktaker with vision to create tomorrow 's opportunity

 the spirit of enterprise be spark by the sunrise industry of high tech and by small business people with big idea people like barbara proctor who rise from a ghetto to build a multimillion dollar advertising agency in chicago carlos perez a cuban refugee who turn $ 27 and a dream into a successful import business in coral gables florida

 people like these be hero for the 80 they help four million americans find job in 1983 more people be draw paycheck tonight than ever before and congress help or progress help everyone well congress do too laughter everyone in 1983 woman fill 73 percent of all the new job in managerial professional and technical field

 but we know that many of our fellow countryman be still out of work wonder what will come of their hope and dream can we love america and not reach out to tell they you be not forget we will not rest until each of you can reach as high as your god give talent will take you

 the heart of america be strong it be good and true the cynic be wrong america never be a sick society we be see rededication to bedrock value of faith family work neighborhood peace and freedom value that help bring we together as one people from the young child to the most senior citizen

 the congress deserve america 's thank for help we restore pride and credibility to our military and i hope that you be as proud as i be of the young man and woman in uniform who have volunteer to man the rampart in defense of freedom and whose dedication valor and skill increase so much our chance of live in a world at peace

 people everywhere hunger for peace and a well life the tide of the future be a freedom tide and our struggle for democracy can not and will not be deny this nation champion peace that enshrine liberty democratic right and dignity for every individual america 's new strength confidence and purpose be carry hope and opportunity far from our shore a world economic recovery be underway it begin here

 we have journey far but we have much farth to go franklin roosevelt tell we 50 year ago this month civilization can not go back civilization must not stand still we have undertake new method it be our task to perfect to improve to alter when necessary but in all case to go forward

 it be time to move forward again time for america to take freedom 's next step let we unite tonight behind four great goal to keep america free secure and at peace in the 80 together

 we can ensure steady economic growth we can develop america 's next frontier we can strengthen our traditional value and we can build a meaningful peace to protect our love one and this shine star of faith that have guide million from tyranny to the safe harbor of freedom progress and hope

 do these thing will open wider the gate of opportunity provide great security for all with no barrier of bigotry or discrimination

 the key to a dynamic decade be vigorous economic growth our first great goal we might well begin with common sense in federal budgeting government spend no more than government take in

 we must bring federal deficit down but how we do that make all the difference

 we can begin by limit the size and scope of government under the leadership of vice president bush we have reduce the growth of federal regulation by more than 25 percent and cut well over 300 million hour of government require paperwork each year this will save the public more than $ 150 billion over the next 10 year

 the grace commission have give we some 2,500 recommendation for reduce wasteful spending and they be be examine throughout the administration federal spending growth have be cut from 17.4 percent in 1980 to less than half of that today and we have already achieve over $ 300 billion in budget saving for the period of 1982 to 86 but that be only a little more than half of what we seek government be still spend too large a percentage of the total economy

 now some insist that any further budget saving must be obtain by reduce the portion spend on defense this ignore the fact that national defense be solely the responsibility of the federal government indeed it be its prime responsibility and yet defense spending be less than a third of the total budget during the year of president kennedy and of the year before that defense be almost half the total budget and then come several year in which our military capability be allow to deteriorate to a very dangerous degree we be just now restore through the essential modernization of our conventional and strategic force our capability to meet our present and future security need we dare not shirk our responsibility to keep america free secure and at peace

 the last decade see domestic spending surge literally out of control but the basis for such spending have be lay in previous year a pattern of overspending have be in place for half a century as the national debt grow we be tell not to worry that we owe it to ourselves

 now we know that deficit be a cause for worry but there be a difference of opinion as to whether taxis should be increase spend cut or some of both fear be express that government borrowing to fund the deficit could inhibit the economic recovery by take capital need for business and industrial expansion well i think that debate be miss an important point whether government borrow or increase taxis it will be take the same amount of money from the private sector and either way that be too much simple fairness dictate that government must not raise taxis on family struggle to pay their bill the root of the problem be that government 's share be more than we can afford if we be to have a sound economy

 we must bring down the deficit to ensure continue economic growth in the budget that i will submit on february 1 i will recommend measure that will reduce the deficit over the next five year many of these will be unfinished business from last year 's budget

 some could be enact quickly if we could join in a serious effort to address this problem i speak today with speaker of the house o'neill senate majority leader baker senate minority leader byrd and house minority leader michel i ask they if they would designate congressional representative to meet with representative of the administration to try to reach prompt agreement on a bipartisan deficit reduction plan i know it would take a long hard struggle to agree on a full scale plan so what i have propose be that we first see if we can agree on a down payment

 now i believe there be basis for such an agreement one that could reduce the deficit by about $ 100 billion over the next three year we could focus on some of the less contentious spending cut that be still pende before the congress these could be combine with measure to close certain tax loophole measure that the treasury department have previously say to be worthy of support in addition we could examine the possibility of achieve further outlay saving base on the work of the grace commission

 if the congressional leadership be willing my representative will be prepare to meet with theirs at the early possible time i would hope the leadership might agree on an expedited timetable in which to develop and enact that down payment

 but a down payment alone be not enough to break we out of the deficit problem it could help we start on the right path yet we must do more so i propose that we begin explore how together we can make structural reform to curb the build in growth of spending

 i also propose improvement in the budgeting process some 43 of our 50 state grant their governor the right to veto individual item in appropriation bill without have to veto the entire bill california be one of those 43 state as governor i find this line item veto be a powerful tool against wasteful or extravagant spending it work in 43 state let us put it to work in washington for all the people

 it would be most effective if do by constitutional amendment the majority of americans approve of such an amendment just as they and i approve of an amendment mandate a balanced federal budget many state also have this protection in their constitution

 to talk of meet the present situation by increase taxis be a band aid solution which do nothing to cure an illness that be be come on for half a century to say nothing of the fact that it pose a real threat to economic recovery let us remember that a substantial amount of income tax be presently owe and not pay by people in the underground economy it would be immoral to make those who be pay taxis pay more to compensate for those who be not pay their share

 there be a well way let we go forward with an historic reform for fairness simplicity and incentive for growth i be ask secretary don regan for a plan for action to simplify the entire tax code so all taxpayer big and small be treat more fairly and i believe such a plan could result in that underground economy be bring into the sunlight of honest tax compliance and it could make the tax base broader so personal tax rate could come down not go up i have ask that specific recommendation consistent with those objective be present to i by december 1984

 our second great goal be to build on america 's pioneer spirit laughter i say something funny laughter i say america 's next frontier and that be to develop that frontier a sparkling economy spur initiative sunrise industry and make old one more competitive

 nowhere be this more important than our next frontier space nowhere do we so effectively demonstrate our technological leadership and ability to make life well on earth the space age be barely a quarter of a century old but already we have push civilization forward with our advance in science and technology opportunity and job will multiply as we cross new threshold of knowledge and reach deeply into the unknown

 our progress in space take giant step for all mankind be a tribute to american teamwork and excellence our fine mind in government industry and academia have all pull together and we can be proud to say we be first we be the good and we be so because we be free

 america have always be great when we dare to be great we can reach for greatness again we can follow our dream to distant star live and work in space for peaceful economic and scientific gain tonight i be direct nasa to develop a permanently manned space station and to do it within a decade

 a space station will permit quantum leap in our research in science communication in metal and in lifesave medicine which could be manufacture only in space we want our friend to help we meet these challenge and share in their benefit nasa will invite other country to participate so we can strengthen peace build prosperity and expand freedom for all who share our goal

 just as the ocean open up a new world for clipper ship and yankee trader space hold enormous potential for commerce today the market for space transportation could surpass our capacity to develop it company interested in put payload into space must have ready access to private sector launch service the department of transportation will help an expendable launch service industry to get off the ground we will soon implement a number of executive initiative develop proposal to ease regulatory constraint and with nasa 's help promote private sector investment in space

 and as we develop the frontier of space let we remember our responsibility to preserve our old resource here on earth preservation of our environment be not a liberal or conservative challenge it be common sense

 though this be a time of budget constraint i have request for epa one of the large percentage budget increase of any agency we will begin the long necessary effort to clean up a productive recreational area and a special national resource the chesapeake bay

 to reduce the threat pose by abandon hazardous waste dump epa will spend $ 410 million and i will request a supplemental increase of $ 50 million and because the superfund law expire in 1985 i have ask bill ruckelshaus to develop a proposal for its extension so there will be additional time to complete this important task

 on the question of acid rain which concern people in many area of the united states and canada i be propose a research program that double our current funding and we will take additional action to restore our lake and develop new technology to reduce pollution that cause acid rain

 we have greatly improve the condition of our natural resource we will ask the congress for $ 157 million beginning in 1985 to acquire new park and conservation land the department of the interior will encourage careful selective exploration and production on our vital resource in an exclusive economic zone within the 200 mile limit off our coast but with strict adherence to environmental law and with full state and public participation

 but our most precious resource our great hope for the future be the mind and heart of our people especially our child we can help they build tomorrow by strengthen our community of share value this must be our third great goal for we faith work family neighborhood freedom and peace be not just word they be expression of what america mean definition of what make we a good and love people

 family stand at the center of our society and every family have a personal stake in promote excellence in education excellence do not begin in washington a 600 percent increase in federal spending on education between 1960 and 1980 be accompany by a steady decline in scholastic aptitude test score excellence must begin in our home and neighborhood school where it be the responsibility of every parent and teacher and the right of every child

 our child come first and that be why i establish a bipartisan national commission on excellence in education to help we chart a commonsense course for well education and already community be implement the commission 's recommendation school be report progress in math and reading skill but we must do more to restore discipline to school and we must encourage the teaching of new basic reward teacher of merit enforce tough standard and put our parent back in charge

 i will continue to press for tuition tax credit to expand opportunity for family and to soften the double payment for those pay public school taxis and private school tuition our proposal would target assistance to low- and middle income family just as more incentive be need within our school great competition be need among our school without standard and competition there can be no champion no record break no excellence in education or any other walk of life

 and while i be on this subject each day your member observe a 200 year old tradition mean to signify america be one nation under god i must ask if you can begin your day with a member of the clergy stand right here lead you in prayer then why can not freedom to acknowledge god be enjoy again by child in every schoolroom across this land

 america be found by people who believe that god be their rock of safety he be ours i recognize we must be cautious in claim that god be on our side but i think it be all right to keep ask if we be on his side

 during our first three year we have join bipartisan effort to restore protection of the law to unborn child now i know this issue be very controversial but unless and until it can be prove that an unborn child be not a live human being can we justify assume without proof that it be not no one have yet offer such proof indeed all the evidence be to the contrary we should rise above bitterness and reproach and if americans could come together in a spirit of understanding and help then we could find positive solution to the tragedy of abortion

 economic recovery well education rededication to value all show the spirit of renewal gain the upper hand and all will improve family life in the 80 but family need more they need assurance that they and their loved one can walk the street of america without be afraid parent need to know their child will not be victim of child pornography and abduction this year we will intensify our drive against these and other horrible crime like sexual abuse and family violence

 already our effort to crack down on career criminal organized crime drugpusher and to enforce tough sentence and parole be have effect in 1982 the crime rate drop by 4.3 percent the big decline since 1972 protect victim be just as important as safeguard the right of defendant

 opportunity for all americans will increase if we move forward in fair housing and work to ensure woman 's right provide for equitable treatment in pension benefit and individual retirement accounts facilitate child care and enforce delinquent parent support payment

 it be not just the home but the workplace and community that sustain our value and shape our future so i ask your help in assist more community to break the bondage of dependency help we to free enterprise by permit debate and vote yes on our proposal for enterprise zone in america this have be before you for two year its passage can help high unemployment area by create job and restore neighborhood

 a society burst with opportunity reach for its future with confidence sustain by faith fair play and a conviction that good and courageous people will flourish when they be free these be the secret of a strong and prosperous america at peace with itself and the world

 a lasting and meaningful peace be our fourth great goal it be our high aspiration and our record be clear americans resort to force only when we must we have never be aggressor we have always struggle to defend freedom and democracy

 we have no territorial ambition we occupy no country we build no wall to lock people in americans build the future and our vision of a well life for farmer merchant and work people from the americas to asia begin with a simple premise the future be well decide by ballot not bullet

 government which rest upon the consent of the govern do not wage war on their neighbor only when people be give a personal stake in decide their own destiny benefit from their own risk do they create society that be prosperous progressive and free tonight it be democracy that offer hope by feed the hungry prolong life and eliminate drudgery

 when it come to keep america strong free and at peace there should be no republicans or democrats just patriotic americans we can decide the tough issue not by who be right but by what be right

 together we can continue to advance our agenda for peace we can establish a more stable basis for peaceful relation with the soviet union strengthen ally relation across the board achieve real and equitable reduction in the level of nuclear arm reinforce our peacemaking effort in the middle east central america and southern africa or assist develop country particularly our neighbor in the western hemisphere and assist in the development of democratic institution throughout the world

 the wisdom of our bipartisan cooperation be see in the work of the scowcroft commission which strengthen our ability to deter war and protect peace in that same spirit i urge you to move forward with the henry jackson plan to implement the recommendation of the bipartisan commission on central america

 your joint resolution on the multinational peacekeeping force in lebanon be also serve the cause of peace we be make progress in lebanon for nearly 10 year the lebanese have live from tragedy to tragedy with no hope for their future now the multinational peacekeeping force and our marine be help they break their cycle of despair there be hope for a free independent and sovereign lebanon we must have the courage to give peace a chance and we must not be drive from our objective for peace in lebanon by state sponsor terrorism we have see this ugly specter in beirut kuwait and rangoon it demand international attention i will forward shortly legislative proposal to help combat terrorism and i will be seek support from our ally for concerted action

 our nato alliance be strong 1983 be a banner year for political courage and we have strengthen our partnership and our friendship in the far east we be committed to dialog deterrence and promote prosperity we will work with our trading partner for a new round of negotiation in support of free world trade great competition and more open market

 a rebirth of bipartisan cooperation of economic growth and military deterrence and a grow spirit of unity among our people at home and our ally abroad underline a fundamental and far reach change the united states be safe strong and more secure in 1984 than before we can now move with confidence to seize the opportunity for peace and we will

 tonight i want to speak to the people of the soviet union to tell they it be true that our government have have serious difference but our son and daughter have never fight each other in war and if we americans have our way they never will

 people of the soviet union there be only one sane policy for your country and mine to preserve our civilization in this modern age a nuclear war can not be win and must never be fight the only value in our two nation possess nuclear weapon be to make sure they will never be use but then would it not be well to do away with they entirely

 people of the soviet president dwight eisenhower who fight by your side in world war ii say the essential struggle be not merely man against man or nation against nation it be man against war americans be people of peace if your government want peace there will be peace we can come together in faith and friendship to build a safe and far well world for our child and our child 's child and the whole world will rejoice that be my message to you

 some day when life seem hard and we reach out for value to sustain we or a friend to help we we find a person who remind we what it mean to be americans

 sergeant stephen trujillo a medic in the 2nd ranger battalion 75th infantry be in the first helicopter to land at the compound hold by cuban force in grenada he see three other helicopter crash despite the imminent explosion of the burn aircraft he never hesitate he run across 25 yard of open terrain through enemy fire to rescue wound soldier he direct two other medic administer first aid and return again and again to the crash site to carry his wound friend to safety

 sergeant trujillo you and your fellow service man and woman not only save innocent life you set a nation free you inspire we as a force for freedom not for despotism and yes for peace not conquest god bless you

 and then there be unsung hero single parent couple church and civic volunteer their heart carry without complaint the pain of family and community problem they soothe our sorrow heal our wound calm our fear and share our joy

 a person like father ritter be always there his covenant house program in new york and houston provide shelter and help to thousand of frightened and abuse child each year the same be true of dr. charles carson paralyze in a plane crash he still believe nothing be impossible today in minnesota he work 80 hour a week without pay help pioneer the field of computer control walking he have give hope to 500,000 paralyzed americans that some day they may walk again

 how can we not believe in the greatness of america how can we not do what be right and need to preserve this last good hope of man on earth after all our struggle to restore america to revive confidence in our country hope for our future after all our hard win victory earn through the patience and courage of every citizen we can not must not and will not turn back we will finish our job how could we do less we be americans

 carl sandburg say i see america not in the set sun of a black night of despair i see america in the crimson light of a rise sun fresh from the burning creative hand of god i see great day ahead for man and woman of will and vision

 i have never feel more strongly that america 's good day and democracy 's good day lie ahead we be a powerful force for good with faith and courage we can perform great deed and take freedom 's next step and we will we will carry on the tradition of a good and worthy people who have bring light where there be darkness warmth where there be cold medicine where there be disease food where there be hunger and peace where there be only bloodshed

 as i say wednesday night america be back and stand tall we have begin to restore great american value the dignity of work the warmth of family the strength of neighborhood and the nourishment of human freedom

 but our work be not finish we have more to do in create job achieve control over government spending return more autonomy to the states keep peace in a more settled world and see if we can not find room in our school for god

 at my inaugural i quote word that have be speak over 200 year ago by dr. joseph warren president of the massachusetts congress on you depend the fortune of america he tell his fellow americans you be to decide the important question on which rest the happiness and liberty of million yet unborn and he add act worthy of yourself

 over these last three year nancy and i have be sustain by the way you the real hero of american democracy have meet dr. warren 's challenge you be magnificent as we pull the nation through the long night of our national calamity you have indeed act worthy of yourself

 your high standard make we remember the central question of public service why be we here well we be here to see that government continue to serve you not the other way around

 this historic room and the presidency belong to you it be your right and responsibility every four year to give someone temporary custody of this office and of the institution of the presidency you so honor i and i be grateful grateful and proud of what together we have accomplish

 we have make a new beginning vice president bush and i would like to have your continue support and cooperation in complete what we begin three year ago i be therefore announce that i be a candidate and will seek reelection to the office i presently hold

 thank you for the trust you have place in i god bless you and good night





the president madam president and all of you please be seat i'm delight to be with you today i be especially pleased to be here because as i have already tell madame xie i feel i have a family tie to fudan university you see the president of this university and my wife nancy both earn degree from smith college in america

 as an avid sport fan and one time sport announcer on radio i want to use this opportunity to express my admiration for fudan university 's championship man and woman 's volleyball team and before i say anything else i want to congratulate fudan university on acquire a powerful american honeywell computer

 as student you may be ask yourselves some of the same question that american student ask question i ask when i be in college myself what kind of a world be i prepare myself for will i be able to raise my own family as well as or maybe well than my parent raise i

 my own college day year take place some 50 year ago it be a difficult time in america then we be in a great worldwide depression and i use to wonder what kind of place i could find for myself after graduation but here we be 50 year later and our people the american people enjoy a standard of living that be undreame of back then

 each decade during those past 50 year real income per person in america rise an average of nearly 30 percent and today in america we have take or thing we take for grant that do not even exist 50 year ago television computer space flight and so many more thing include the very means of travel space or the jet travel bring i here to this country

 yes hunger and sickness still exist in many part of the world and in our own land but thank to breakthrough in agriculture and medicine today more people on earth eat well and live long than ever before in the history of our planet as a matter of fact i have live some 20 odd year long than my life expectancy when i be bear now that be a source of annoyance to a number of people in my own country

 but the key to all this progress have not be mineral electricity or building material but the human capacity for intelligence imagination and wonder and the opportunity to put all of they to use

 here in china for example century ago wood be use only for our most basic need like keep warm it be the ingenuity of the human mind that devise method of turn wood into paper transform civilization by make it possible to store and exchange the write word in the united states just a few year ago when we think of sand we think of little more than desert and beach and today we use that sand to make the computer chip that guide satellite through space

 i be convinced that each of you stand at a great beginning the chinese people have skill ingenuity and a rich heritage and those of you who be privileged to come to this university will help lead your country to new prosperity if i could offer one piece of advice to remember in the year ahead i would suggest this it be not so much what be inside the earth that count but what be inside one 's heart and mind because that be the stuff that dream be make of and china 's future depend on your dream and your faith and determination to make your dream come true

 and now i thank you again for my be here and i would be very happy to entertain a few question in the limited time that we have if you have some

 q. respected mr. president just now you recall your life 50 year ago when you be young so now could you specify which aspect of your university life impress you most and which of these experience turn to be most helpful to your later political career

 the president all right well you know i go not to a large university like this i go to a small liberal art college similar to smith college and the funny thing be it be literally all of it i major in economic and so therefore my study certainly have play a part in what i be do now laughter i have two other great interest in addition one be athletic and i play football basketball run on the track team swam and when i get out of school in that great depression when even our own government be tell people on the radio not to go leave home look for work because there be none more than a fourth of our work force unemployed believe it or not it be the athletic that get i my first job in radio as a sport announcer

 and from there i go to hollywood because the other great interest that i have have besides go to the class in the college be in student theatrical act in play and drama so i wound up in hollywood and i have to say that today while not only the economic and the athletic still serve i in good stead in the job i be in you would be surprised how much be a good actor pay off laughter someone else

 q. mr. president in recent year fudan have be develop academic exchange with a number of american university and we be look forward to the further expansion of such exchange and collaboration so my question be what do you think be the prospect of the further promotion of such tie

 the president i think the prospect be very good indeed i have be talk to your national leader about that very thing we have more than 10,000 of your student in our university and college in america right now a less number of our be here but we discuss this whole thing of make this exchange even well and more even and definitely want to continue it and i have the opportunity just before leave to come here of meet with about a dozen of those 10,000 who come to the white house and we have an opportunity to visit and they be fine young people and you will be very proud of they when they come home

 q. mr. president just now you mention the role of young people in the progress of the world and i think the future of the world belong to the youth and we chinese young people be confront with the task of realize our modernization program and maintain a world peace so i would like to know how the american young people be prepare themselves for such a change world

 the president i think they be do it very much the same as you be right here there be a period when there be a kind of rebellious spirit in our land and many young people not a majority but enough of they to make quite a crowd be somewhat disillusioned and they want to throw away all the value of the past all the thing that we have learn to believe in and you know this be true of every generation we all think that the generation that go before we do not quite do thing right and we be go to make some change and all but be very careful do not throw away the value that have be test through time and that have prove over the century that they be basic value essential to civilization and to what we call civilization

 there be since that time and i see it here also there have be a change and our young people all over america be determined to make a place for themselves in the world of tomorrow they be work hard they be serious about it and i think there be be a return now to acceptance of the basic value that have always make for civilization and you have to remember this also every generation stand on the shoulder of the generation that go before and so you see far because you be stand tall than we do and can look far but at least give we the credit that you be see far because you be stand on our shoulder do not settle for the same level of view that we have realize that you be to look on and beyond and progress

 q. mr. president i be a student of international politic so i would like to know after your trip to china what measure be you go to take to far improve sino american relation

 the president well this too be the subject of the discussion that i have have with chairman deng and premier zhao president li other in your government

 we sign this morning some agreement that have to do with commerce and trade and broaden the ability for exchange and for partnership such as the one that i just visit here in shanghai when i arrive before i come here the foxboro company which be a partnership between the people 's republic and the foxboro company of massachusetts in our own country we talk of all these thing as to how we can broaden the base of friendship and understanding and knowledge of each other and this include that part with the exchange of student and all

 we have sign an agreement with regard to double taxation and eliminate the unfairness of double taxation so that there can be a well opportunity for the people of your country and our we be continue to negotiate on a number of issue that be of concern cultural exchange right now in beijing and then i understand it be go to go to other city be an art exhibit from one of our art museum in brooklyn new york you in turn be go to send your art treasure to our country for our people to understand well

 so i guess it come down to something that be a favorite saying of mine we only get in trouble when we be talk about each other not when we be talk to each other so we be go to be talk to each other a great deal

 q. mr. president what part do you think the american university have be play in the development of science and technology in united states and in face of the new technological revolution what be they do about it now

 the president i do not hear the last part of the question the last part

 q. in face of the new technological revolution what be they do about it now what be the university of the american be do about it now

 the president oh well our university have play a fantastic role in this development the research that be conduct in our university and there be someone right near to i right now who know a great deal about that because in addition to smith she also go to the massachusetts institute of technology one of our great technical engineering school

 madam xie thank you

 the president and i think could give you all the information that you would need about the research that be go on in our university they have be the center of research in our country and the future be unlimited

 well i be talk to the mayor on the way over here today about his generation and mine he be a few year young than i be but we be still of the same generation and our generation you be go to see marvelous thing i be not sure that you will see the great change or transition that we do in our single lifetime because when i be very young live in a small town in america you travel in horse and buggy

 i can remember my first automobile ride there be no airplane then there be no television there be no radio and there be certainly no travel in space but we have in one generation we have go from horse and buggy to the moon in a spaceship and all of that those be the building block that you have with which to go forward from here and do not be afraid to dream and make your dream come true someone else

 q. mr. president your china trip will soon come to its end could you tell we what impress you most during this visit and what impression you especially want to convey to american young people when you be back home

 the president what impress i most i be still sort it out it be a kaleidoscope

 one thing above all that impress i almost before we get to the guest house in beijing when we fly in the other day be the warmth and the friendliness of you the chinese people toward we it be a most and have be a most heartwarming experience ever since we have be here we shall remember it for a long long time

 but then be the vitality the change that be take place the program of modernization itself the courage that it take to embark on that and then the manner in which it be succeed and couple with that which help make it a kaleidoscope be then also the few glimpse that we have of the great heritage a civilization that begin here long before it have begin anyplace in the world you have go through so much of civilization before in the west the roman empire ever even come into being or fall

 and the first be the trip to the wall now i have see picture of it on television i have see motion picture and everything i be not quite prepared for the feeling that i have stand there and look at the almost impossibility of that structure and then to think that a people do it several thousand year ago and i be get a little bit weak in the knee from climb one of the steep slope and then i say to myself but a few thousand year ago people be climb this slope carry rock

 and then yesterday we go to xi'an and go down in the pit and stand there with the terra cotta warrior and to think in term of all this and you know well you probably know this already but there be no two of they alike you know you could think of 800 terra cotta warrior and they would all be the same no they all have different face they have different hair comb and i almost have an eerie feeling that they might speak to i

 but the mix of the great civilization and heritage that you have and today of the speed and drive of your modernization program and i just go home with a dream in my heart that we perhaps have start a friendship here between two great people not an alliance i admire the position of be nonaligne that you have but be friend and neighbor and that we will be friend and neighbor and we can be such a force for good in the world if we be

 q. thank you for your kind audience mr. president please take back good regard from we the student of fudan university to the american people especially to american student thank you

 the president thank you

 mr. liu well on behalf of the student and in my own name i should like to thank mr. president again for having come over to our classroom and talk to we and we all appreciate your beautiful speech the gracious thing you say about china and fudan university and your superb answer to our question

 thank you

 the president well thank you very much thank you all

 can i take just a second for something the press will get very annoyed with i they have hear i tell this so often but just a few week ago we have a visitor in our land the president of france and his wife madam mitterrand and in the white house at a state dinner nancy be accompany the president i be accompany mrs. mitterrand into the dining room everyone stand around the table and nancy and the president stay on this side of the room and mrs. mitterrand and i start at the other side of the room and i tell this just as an example of how close you can come to a diplomatic crisis

 suddenly madam mitterrand stop and we have the room to cross yet and i lean forward to tell she that we be to go on over there and the butler ahead of she be motion she on and she say something very quietly and calmly over her shoulder to i in french which i do not understand laughter and again i give the signal and again she repeat what she have say to i and then the interpreter catch up with we and tell i what she be say i be stand on her gown she could not move

 thank you very much



 my fellow americans memorial day be a day of ceremony and speech throughout america today we honor the dead of our war we recall their valor and their sacrifice we remember they give their life so that other might live

 we be also gather here for a special event the national funeral for an unknown soldier who will today join the hero of three other war

 when he speak at a ceremony at gettysburg in 1863 president lincoln remind we that through their deed the dead have speak more eloquently for themselves than any of the living ever could and that we live could only honor they by rededicate ourselves to the cause for which they so willingly give a last full measure of devotion

 well this be especially so today for in our mind and heart be the memory of vietnam and all that that conflict mean for those who sacrifice on the field of battle and for their love one who suffer here at home

 not long ago when a memorial be dedicate here in washington to our vietnam veteran the event surround that dedication be a stirring reminder of america 's resilience of how our nation could learn and grow and transcend the tragedy of the past

 during the dedication ceremony the roll of those who die and be still miss be read for 3 day in a candlelight ceremony at the national cathedral and the veteran of vietnam who be never welcome home with speech and band but who be never defeat in battle and be hero as surely as any who have ever fight in a noble cause stage their own parade on constitution avenue as america watch they some in wheelchair all of they proud there be a feeling that this nation that as a nation we be come together again and that we have at long last welcome the boy home

 a lot of healing go on say one combat veteran who helped organize support for the memorial and then there be this newspaper account that appear after the ceremony i would like to read it to you yesterday crowd return to the memorial among they be herbie petit a machinist and former marine from new orleans last night he say stand near the wall i go out to dinner with some other ex marine there be also a group of college student in the restaurant we start talk to each other and before we leave they stand up and cheer we the whole week petit say his eye red it be worth it just for that

 it have be worth it we americans have learn to listen to each other and to trust each other again we have learn that government owe the people an explanation and need their support for its action at home and abroad and we have learn and i pray this time for good the most valuable lesson of all the preciousness of human freedom

 it have be a lesson relearn not just by americans but by all the people of the world yet while the experience of vietnam have give we a stark lesson that ultimately must move the conscience of the world we must remember that we can not today as much as some might want to close this chapter in our history for the war in southeast asia still haunt a small but brave group of americans the family of those still miss in the vietnam conflict

 they live day and night with uncertainty with an emptiness with a void that we can not fathom today some sit among you their feeling be a mixture of pride and fear they be proud of their son or husband father or brother who bravely and nobly answer the call of their country but some of they fear that this ceremony write a final chapter leave those they love forget

 well today then one way to honor those who serve or may still be serve in vietnam be to gather here and rededicate ourselves to secure the answer for the family of those miss in action i ask the members of congress the leader of veteran group and the citizen of an entire nation present or listen to give these family your help and your support for they still sacrifice and suffer

 vietnam be not over for they they can not rest until they know the fate of those they love and watch march off to serve their country our dedication to their cause must be strengthen with these event today we write no last chapter we close no book we put away no final memory an end to america 's involvement in vietnam can not come before we have achieve the full possible accounting of those miss in action

 this can only happen when their family know with certainty that this nation discharge her duty to those who serve nobly and well today a united people call upon hanoi with one voice heal the sore wound of this conflict return our son to america end the grief of those who be innocent and undeserving of any retribution

 the unknown soldier who be return to we today and whom we lay to rest be symbolic of all our miss son and we will present he with the congressional medal of honor the high military decoration that we can bestow

 about he we may well wonder as other have as a child do he play on some street in a great american city or do he work beside his father on a farm out in america 's heartland do he marry do he have child do he look expectantly to return to a bride

 we will never know the answer to these question about his life we do know though why he die he see the horror of war but bravely face they certain his own cause and his country 's cause be a noble one that he be fight for human dignity for free man everywhere today we pause to embrace he and all who serve we so well in a war whose end offer no parade no flag and so little thank we can be worthy of the value and ideal for which our son sacrifice worthy of their courage in the face of a fear that few of we will ever experience by honor their commitment and devotion to duty and country

 many veteran of vietnam still serve in the armed forces work in our office on our farm and in our factory most have keep their experience private but most have be strengthen by their call to duty a grateful nation open her heart today in gratitude for their sacrifice for their courage and for their noble service let we if we must debate the lesson learn at some other time today we simply say with pride thank you dear son may god cradle you in his love arm

 we present to you our nation 's high award the congressional medal of honor for service above and beyond the call of duty in action with the enemy during the vietnam era

 thank you

 not long ago when a memorial be dedicate here in washington to our vietnam veteran the event surround that dedication be a stirring reminder of america 's resilience of how our nation could learn and grow and transcend the tragedy of the past

 during the dedication ceremony the roll of those who die and be still miss be read for three day in a candlelight ceremony at the national cathedral and the veteran of vietnam who be never welcome home with speech and band but who be never defeat in battle and be hero as surely as any who have ever fight in a noble cause stage their own parade on constitution avenue as america watch they some in wheelchair all of they proud there be a feeling that this nation that as a nation we be come together again and that we have at long last welcome the boy home

 a lot of healing go on say one combat veteran who helped organize support for the memorial and then there be this newspaper account that appear after the ceremony i would like to read it to you yesterday crowd return to the memorial among they be herbie petit a machinist and former marine from new orleans last night he say stand near the wall i go out to dinner with some other ex marine there be also a group of college student in the restaurant we start talk to each other and before we leave they stand up and cheer we the whole week petit say his eye red it be worth it just for that

 it have be worth it we americans have learn to listen to each other and to trust each other again we have learn that government owe the people an explanation and need their support for its action at home and abroad and we have learn and i pray this time for good the most valuable lesson of all the preciousness of human freedom

 it have be a lesson relearn not just by americans but by all the people of the world yet while the experience of vietnam have give we a stark lesson that ultimately must move the conscience of the world we must remember that we can not today as much as some might want to close this chapter in our history for the war in southeast asia still haunt a small but brave group of americans the family of those still miss in the vietnam conflict

 they live day and night with uncertainty with an emptiness with a void that we can not fathom today some sit among you their feeling be a mixture of pride and fear they be proud of their son or husband father or brother who bravely and nobly answer the call of their country but some of they fear that this ceremony write a final chapter leave those they love forget

 well today then one way to honor those who serve or may still be serve in vietnam be to gather here and rededicate ourselves to secure the answer for the family of those miss in action i ask the members of congress the leader of veteran group and the citizen of an entire nation present or listen to give these family your help and your support for they still sacrifice and suffer

 vietnam be not over for they they can not rest until they know the fate of those they love and watch march off to serve their country our dedication to their cause must be strengthen with these event today we write no last chapter we close no book we put away no final memory an end to america 's involvement in vietnam can not come before we have achieve the full possible accounting of those miss in action

 this can only happen when their family know with certainty that this nation discharge her duty to those who serve nobly and well today a united people call upon hanoi with one voice heal the sore wound of this conflict return our son to america end the grief of those who be innocent and undeserving of any retribution

 the unknown soldier who be return to we today and whom we lay to rest be symbolic of all our miss son and we will present he with the congressional medal of honor the high military decoration that we can bestow

 about he we may well wonder as other have as a child do he play on some street in a great american city or do he work beside his father on a farm out in america 's heartland do he marry do he have child do he look expectantly to return to a bride

 we will never know the answer to these question about his life we do know though why he die he see the horror of war but bravely face they certain his own cause and his country 's cause be a noble one that he be fight for human dignity for free man everywhere today we pause to embrace he and all who serve we so well in a war whose end offer no parade no flag and so little thank we can be worthy of the value and ideal for which our son sacrifice worthy of their courage in the face of a fear that few of we will ever experience by honor their commitment and devotion to duty and country

 many veteran of vietnam still serve in the armed forces work in our office on our farm and in our factory most have keep their experience private but most have be strengthen by their call to duty a grateful nation open her heart today in gratitude for their sacrifice for their courage and for their noble service let we if we must debate the lesson learn at some other time today we simply say with pride thank you dear son may god cradle you in his love arm

 we present to you our nation 's high award the congressional medal of honor for service above and beyond the call of duty in action with the enemy during the vietnam era

 thank you

we be here to mark that day in history when the allied army join in battle to reclaim this continent to liberty for 4 long year much of europe have be under a terrible shadow free nation have fall jews cry out in the camp million cry out for liberation europe be enslave and the world pray for its rescue here in normandy the rescue begin here the allies stand and fight against tyranny in a giant undertaking unparalleled in human history
 we stand on a lonely windswept point on the northern shore of france the air be soft but 40 year ago at this moment the air be dense with smoke and the cry of man and the air be fill with the crack of rifle fire and the roar of cannon at dawn on the morning of the 6th of june 1944 225 ranger jump off the british landing craft and run to the bottom of these cliff their mission be one of the most difficult and daring of the invasion to climb these sheer and desolate cliff and take out the enemy gun the allies have be tell that some of the mighty of these gun be here and they would be train on the beach to stop the allied advance
 the rangers look up and see the enemy soldier the edge of the cliff shoot down at they with machinegun and throw grenade and the american rangers begin to climb they shoot rope ladder over the face of these cliff and begin to pull themselves up when one ranger fall another would take his place when one rope be cut a ranger would grab another and begin his climb again they climb shoot back and hold their footing soon one by one the rangers pull themselves over the top and in seize the firm land at the top of these cliff they begin to seize back the continent of europe two hundred and twenty five come here after 2 day of fighting only 90 could still bear arm
 behind i be a memorial that symbolize the ranger dagger that be thrust into the top of these cliff and before i be the man who put they there
 these be the boy of pointe du hoc these be the man who take the cliff these be the champion who helped free a continent these be the hero who help end a war
 gentleman i look at you and i think of the word of stephen spender 's poem you be man who in your life fight for life and leave the vivid air sign with your honor
 i think i know what you may be think right now think we be just part of a big effort everyone be brave that day well everyone be do you remember the story of bill millin of the 51st highlander forty year ago today british troop be pin down near a bridge wait desperately for help suddenly they hear the sound of bagpipe and some think they be dream well they be not they look up and see bill millin with his bagpipe lead the reinforcement and ignore the smack of the bullet into the ground around he
 lord lovat be with he lord lovat of scotland who calmly announce when he get to the bridge sorry i be a few minute late as if he have be delay by a traffic jam when in truth he would just come from the bloody fighting on sword beach which he and his man have just take
 there be the impossible valor of the poles who throw themselves between the enemy and the rest of europe as the invasion take hold and the unsurpassed courage of the canadians who have already see the horror of war on this coast they know what await they there but they would not be deter and once they hit juno beach they never look back
 all of these man be part of a rollcall of honor with name that speak of a pride as bright as the color they bore the royal winnipeg rifles poland 's 24th lancers the royal scots fusiliers the screaming eagles the yeomen of england 's armored division the force of free france the coast guard 's matchbox fleet and you the american rangers
 forty summer have pass since the battle that you fight here you be young the day you take these cliff some of you be hardly more than boy with the deep joy of life before you yet you risk everything here why why do you do it what impel you to put aside the instinct for self preservation and risk your life to take these cliff what inspire all the man of the army that meet here we look at you and somehow we know the answer it be faith and belief it be loyalty and love
 the man of normandy have faith that what they be do be right faith that they fight for all humanity faith that a just god would grant they mercy on this beachhead or on the next it be the deep knowledge and pray god we have not lose it that there be a profound moral difference between the use of force for liberation and the use of force for conquest you be here to liberate not to conquer and so you and those other do not doubt your cause and you be right not to doubt
 you all know that some thing be worth die for one 's country be worth die for and democracy be worth die for because it be the most deeply honorable form of government ever devise by man all of you love liberty all of you be willing to fight tyranny and you know the people of your country be behind you
 the americans who fight here that morning know word of the invasion be spread through the darkness back home they fight or feel in their heart though they could not know in fact that in georgia they be fill the church at 4 a.m. in kansas they be kneel on their porch and pray and in philadelphia they be ring the liberty bell
 something else help the man of d day their rockhard belief that providence would have a great hand in the event that would unfold here that god be an ally in this great cause and so the night before the invasion when colonel wolverton ask his parachute troop to kneel with he in prayer he tell they do not bow your head but look up so you can see god and ask his
 blessing in what we be about to do also that night general matthew ridgway on his cot listen in the darkness for the promise god make to joshua i will not fail thee nor forsake thee
 these be the thing that impel they these be the thing that shape the unity of the allies
 when the war be over there be life to be rebuild and government to be return to the people there be nation to be reborn above all there be a new peace to be assure these be huge and daunting task but the allies summon strength from the faith belief loyalty and love of those who fall here they rebuild a new europe together
 there be first a great reconciliation among those who have be enemy all of whom have suffer so greatly the united states do its part create the marshall plan to help rebuild our ally and our former enemy the marshall plan lead to the atlantic alliance a great alliance that serve to this day as our shield for freedom for prosperity and for peace
 in spite of our great effort and success not all that follow the end of the war be happy or plan some liberated country be lose the great sadness of this loss echo down to our own time in the street of warsaw prague and east berlin soviet troop that come to the center of this continent do not leave when peace come they be still there uninvited unwanted unyielding almost 40 year after the war because of this ally force still stand on this continent today as 40 year ago our army be here for only one purpose to protect and defend democracy the only territory we hold be memorial like this one and graveyard where our hero rest
 we in america have learn bitter lesson from two world war it be well to be here ready to protect the peace than to take blind shelter across the sea rush to respond only after freedom be lose we have learn that isolationism never be and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical government with an expansionist intent
 but we try always to be prepare for peace prepare to deter aggression prepare to negotiate the reduction of arm and yes prepare to reach out again in the spirit of reconciliation in truth there be no reconciliation we would welcome more than a reconciliation with the soviet union so together we can lessen the risk of war now and forever
 it be fitting to remember here the great loss also suffer by the russian people during world war ii 20 million perish a terrible price that testify to all the world the necessity of end war i tell you from my heart that we in the united states do not want war we want to wipe from the face of the earth the terrible weapon that man now have in his hand and i tell you we be ready to seize that beachhead we look for some sign from the soviet union that they be willing to move forward that they share our desire and love for peace and that they will give up the way of conquest there must be a change there that will allow we to turn our hope into action
 we will pray forever that some day that change will come but for now particularly today it be good and fitting to renew our commitment to each other to our freedom and to the alliance that protect it
 we be bind today by what bind we 40 year ago the same loyalty tradition and belief we be bind by reality the strength of america 's ally be vital to the united states and the american security guarantee be essential to the continued freedom of europe 's democracy we be with you then we be with you now your hope be our hope and your destiny be our destiny
 here in this place where the west hold together let we make a vow to our dead let we show they by our action that we understand what they die for let our action say to they the word for which matthew ridgway listen i will not fail thee nor forsake thee strengthen by their courage hearten by their value valor and bear by their memory let we continue to stand for the ideal for which they live and die
 thank you very much and god bless you all

mr. chairman mr. vice president delegate to this convention and fellow citizen in 75 day i hope we enjoy a victory that be the size of the heart of texas nancy and i extend our deep thank to the lone star state and the big d"—the city of dallas for all their warmth and hospitality
 four year ago i do not know precisely every duty of this office and not too long ago i learn about some new one from the first grader of corpus christi school in chambersburg pennsylvania little leah kline be ask by her teacher to describe my duty she say the president go to meeting he help the animal the president get frustrate he talk to other president how do wisdom begin at such an early age
 tonight with a full heart and deep gratitude for your trust i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states i will campaign on behalf of the principle of our party which lift america confidently into the future
 america be present with the clear political choice of half a century the distinction between our two party and the different philosophy of our political opponent be at the heart of this campaign and america 's future
 i have be campaign long enough to know that a political party and its leadership can not change their color in four day we will not and no matter how hard they try our opponent do not in san francisco we do not discover our value in a poll take a week before the convention and we do not set a weathervane on top of the golden gate bridge before we start talk about the american family
 the choice this year be not just between two different personality or between two political party they be between two different vision of the future two fundamentally different way of governing their government of pessimism fear and limit or our of hope confidence and growth
 their government see people only as member of group our serve all the people of america as individual theirs live in the past seek to apply the old and fail policy to an era that have pass they by ours learn from the past and strive to change by boldly chart a new course for the future theirs live by promise the big the well we offer prove workable answer
 our opponent begin this campaign hope that america have a poor memory well let us take they on a little stroll down memory lane let us remind they of how a 4.8 percent inflation rate in 1976 become back to back year of double digit inflation the bad since world war i punish the poor and the elderly young couple strive to start their new life and work people struggle to make end meet
 inflation be not some plague bear on the wind it be a deliberate part of their official economic policy need they say to maintain prosperity they do not tell we that with it would come the high interest rate since the civil war as average monthly mortgage payment more than double home building nearly grind to a halt ten of thousand of carpenter and other be throw out of work and who control both houses of the congress and the executive branch at that time not we not we
 campaign across america in 1980 we see evidence everywhere of industrial decline and in rural america farmer cost be drive up by inflation they be devastate by a wrongheade grain embargo and be force to borrow money at exorbitant interest rate just to get by and many of they do not get by farmer have to fight insect weather and the marketplace they should not have to fight their own government
 the high interest rate of 1980 be not talk about in san francisco but how about taxis they be talk about in san francisco will rogers once say he never meet a man he do not like well if i could paraphrase will our friend in the other party have never meet a tax they do not like or hike
 under their policy tax rate have go up three time as much for family with child as they have for everyone else over these past three decade in just the five year before we come into office taxis roughly double
 some who speak so loudly in san francisco of fairness be among those who bring about the big single individual tax increase in our history in 1977 call for a series of increase in the social security payroll tax and in the amount of pay subject to that tax the bill they pass call for two additional increase between now and 1990 increase that bear down hard on those at the low income level
 the census bureau confirm that because of the tax law we inherit the number of household at or below the poverty level pay federal income tax more than double between 1980 and 1982 well they receive some relief in 1983 when our across the board tax cut be fully in place and they will get more help when indexing go into effect this january
 our opponent have repeatedly advocate eliminate indexing would that really hurt the rich no because the rich be already in the top bracket but those work man and woman who depend on a cost of live adjustment just to keep abreast of inflation would find themselves push into high tax bracket and would not even be able to keep even with inflation because they would be pay a high income tax that be bracket creep and our opponent be for it and we be against it
 it be up to we to see that all our fellow citizen understand that confiscatory taxis costly social experiment and economic tinkering be not just the policy of a single administration for the 26 year prior to january of 1981 the opposition party control both houses of congress every spending bill and every tax for more than a quarter of a century have be of their doing
 about a decade ago they say federal spending be out of control so they pass a budget control act and in the next five year run up deficit of $ 260 billion some control
 in 1981 we gain control of the senate and the executive branch with the help of some concerned democrats in the house we start a policy of tighten the federal budget instead of the family budget
 a task force chair by vice president george bush the fine vice president this country have ever have it eliminate unnecessary regulation that have be strangle business and industry
 and while we have our friend down memory lane maybe they would like to recall a gimmick they design for their 1976 campaign as president ford tell we the night before last add the unemployment and inflation rate they get what they call a misery index in 76 it come to 12 1/2 percent they declare the incumbent have no right to seek reelection with that kind of a misery index well four year ago in the 1980 election they do not mention the misery index possibly because it be then over 20 percent and do you know something they will not mention it in this election either it be down to 11.6 and dropping
 by nearly every measure the position of poor americans worsen under the leadership of our opponent teenage drug use out of wedlock birth and crime increase dramatically urban neighborhood and school deteriorate those whom government intend to help discover a cycle of dependency that could not be break government become a drug provide temporary relief but addiction as well
 and let us get some fact on the table that our opponent do not want to hear the big annual increase in poverty take place between 1978 and 1981 over 9 percent each year in the first two year of our administration well i should pardon i i do not put a period in there in the first two year of our administration that annual increase fall to 5.3 percent and 1983 be the first year since 1978 that there be no appreciable increase in poverty at all
 pour hundred of billion of dollar into program in order to make people bad off be irrational and unfair it be time we end this reliance on the government process and renew our faith in the human process
 in 1980 the people decide with we that the economic crisis be not cause by the fact that they live too well government live too well it be time for tax increase to be an act of last resort not of first resort
 the people tell the liberal leadership in washington try shrink the size of government before you shrink the size of our paycheck
 our government be also in serious trouble abroad we have aircraft that could not fly and ship that could not leave port many of our military be on food stamp because of meager earning and reenlistment be down ammunition be low and spare part be in short supply
 many of our ally mistrust we in the four year before we take office country after country fall under the soviet yoke since january 20 1981 not 1 inch of soil have fall to the communists
 all right
 but bad of all americans be lose the confidence and optimism about the future that have make we unique in the world parent be begin to doubt that their child would have the well life that have be the dream of every american generation
 we can all be proud that pessimism be end america be come back and be more confident than ever about the future tonight we thank the citizen of the united states whose faith and unwillingness to give up on themselves or this country save we all
 together we begin the task of control the size and activity of the government by reduce the growth of its spending while pass a tax program to provide incentive to increase productivity for both worker and industry today a work family earn $ 25,000 have about $ 2,900 more in purchase power than if tax and inflation rate be still at the 1980 level
 today of all the major industrial nation of the world america have the strong economic growth one of the low inflation rate the fast rate of job creation six and a half million job in the last year and a half a record 600,000 business incorporation in 1983 and the large increase in real after tax personal income since world war ii we be enjoy the high level of business investment in history and america have renew its leadership in develop the vast new opportunity in science and high technology america be on the move again and expand toward new era of opportunity for everyone
 now we be accuse of have a secret well if we have it be that we be go to keep the mighty engine of this nation rev up and that mean a future of sustained economic growth without inflation that be go to create for our child and grandchild a prosperity that finally will last
 today our troop have new and well equipment their morale be high the well armed they be the less likely it be they will have to use that equipment but if heaven forbid they be ever call upon to defend this nation nothing would be more immoral than ask they to do so with weapon inferior to those of any possible opponent
 we have also begin to repair our valuable alliance especially our historic nato alliance extensive discussion in asia have enable we to start a new round of diplomatic progress there
 in the middle east it remain difficult to bring an end to historic conflict but we be not discouraged and we shall always maintain our pledge never to sell out one of our close friend the state of israel
 close to home there remain a struggle for survival for free latin american states ally of our they valiantly struggle to prevent communist takeover fuel massively by the soviet union and cuba our policy be simple we be not go to betray our friend reward the enemy of freedom or permit fear and retreat to become american policy especially in this hemisphere
 none of the four war in my lifetime come about because we be too strong it be weakness that invite adventurous adversary to make mistaken judgment america be the most peaceful least warlike nation in modern history we be not the cause of all the ill of the world we be a patient and generous people but for the sake of our freedom and that of other we can not permit our reserve to be confuse with a lack of resolve
 ten month ago we display this resolve in a mission to rescue american student on the imprisoned island of grenada democratic candidate have suggest that this could be liken to the soviet invasion of afghanistan the crushing of human right in poland or the genocide in cambodia
 could you imagine harry truman john kennedy hubert humphrey or scoop jackson make such a shocking comparison
 nineteen of our fine young man lose their life on grenada and to even remotely compare their sacrifice to the murderous action take place in afghanistan be unconscionable
 there be some obvious and important difference first we be invite in by six east caribbean states do anyone seriously believe the people of eastern europe or afghanistan invite the russians
 second there be hundred of thousand of soviets occupy captive nation across the world today our combat troop have come home our student be safe and freedom be what we leave behind in grenada
 there be some who have forget why we have a military it be not to promote war it be to be prepare for peace there be a sign over the entrance to fairchild air force base in washington state and that sign say it all peace be our profession
 our next administration all right
 i hear you and that administration will be commit to complete the unfinished agenda that we have place before the congress and the nation it be an agenda which call upon the national democratic leadership to cease its obstructionist way
 we have hear a lot about deficit this year from those on the other side of the aisle well they should be expert on budget deficit they have spend most of their political career create deficit for 42 of the last 50 year they have control both houses of the congress
 and for almost all of those 50 year deficit spending have be their deliberate policy now however they call for an end to deficit they call they ours yet at the same time the leadership of their party resist our every effort to bring federal spending under control for three year straight they have prevent we from adopt a balanced budget amendment to the constitution we will continue to fight for that amendment mandate that government spend no more than government take in
 and we will fight as the vice president tell you for the right of a president to veto item in appropriation bill without have to veto the entire bill there be no well way than the line item veto now use by governor in 43 state to cut out waste in government i know as governor of california i successfully make such veto over 900 time
 now their candidate it would appear have only recently find deficit alarm nearly 10 year ago he insist that a $ 52 billion deficit should be allow to get much big in order to lower unemployment and he say that sometimes we need a deficit in order to stimulate the economy
 as a senator he vote to override president ford 's veto of billion of dollar in spend bill and then vote no on a proposal to cut the 1976 deficit in half
 be anyone surprise by his pledge to raise your taxis next year if give the chance
 in the senate he vote time and again for new taxis include a 10 percent income tax surcharge high taxis on certain consumer item he also vote against cut the excise tax on automobile and he be part and parcel of that big single individual tax increase in history the social security payroll tax of 1977 it triple the maximum tax and still do not make the system solvent
 if our opponent be as vigorous in support our voluntary prayer amendment as they be in raise taxis maybe we could get the lord back in the schoolroom and drug and violence out
 something else illustrate the nature of the choice americans must make while we have be hear a lot of tough talk on crime from our opponent the house democratic leadership continue to block a critical anticrime bill that pass the republican senate by a 91 to-1 vote their burial of this bill mean that you and your family will have to wait for even safe home and street
 there be no long any good reason to hold back passage of tuition tax credit legislation million of average parent pay their full share of taxis to support public school while choose to send their child to parochial or other independent school do not fairness dictate that they should have some help in carry a double burden
 when we talk of the plight of our city what would help more than our enterprise zone bill which provide tax incentive for private industry to help rebuild and restore decayed area in 75 site all across america if they really want a future of boundless new opportunity for our citizen why have they bury enterprise zone over the year in committee
 our opponent be openly commit to increase our tax burden
 we be committed to stop they and we will
 they call their policy the new realism but their new realism be just the old liberalism they will place high and high taxis on small business on family farm and on other work family so that government may once again grow at the people 's expense you know we could say they spend money like drunken sailor but that would be unfair to drunken sailors—[laughter
 all right i agree
 i be go to say it would be unfair because the sailor be spend their own money laughter
 our tax policy be and will remain prowork progrowth and profamily we intend to simplify the entire tax system to make taxis more fair easy to understand and most important to bring the tax rate of every american far down not up now if we bring they down far enough growth will continue strong the underground economy will shrink the world will beat a path to our door and no one will be able to hold america back and the future will be ours
 all right another part of our future the great challenge of all be to reduce the risk of nuclear war by reduce the level of nuclear arm i have address parliament have speak to parliament in europe and asia during these last three and a half year declare that a nuclear war can not be win and must never be fight and those word in those assembly be greet with spontaneous applause
 there be only two nation who by their agreement can rid the world of those doomsday weapon the united states of america and the soviet union for the sake of our child and the safety of this earth we ask the soviets who have walk out of our negotiation to join we in reduce and yes rid the earth of this awful threat
 when we leave this hall tonight we begin to place those clear choice before our fellow citizen we must not let they be confuse by those who still think that gnp stand for gross national promise laughter but after the debate the position paper the speech the convention the television commercial primary caucus and slogan after all this be there really any doubt at all about what will happen if we let they win this november
 be there any doubt that they will raise our taxis
 that they will send inflation into orbit again
 that they will make government big then ever
 and deficit even bad
 raise unemployment
 cut back our defense preparedness
 raise interest rate
 make unilaterial and unwise concession to the soviet union
 and they will do all that in the name of compassion
 it be what they have do to america in the past but if we do our job right they will not be able to do it again
 it be get late
 all right in 1980 we ask the people of america be you well off than you be four year ago well the people answer then by choose we to bring about a change we have every reason now four year later to ask that same question again for we have make a change
 the american people join we and help we let we ask for their help again to renew the mandate of 1980 to move we far forward on the road we presently travel the road of common sense of people in control of their own destiny the road lead to prosperity and economic expansion in a world at peace
 as we ask for their help we should also answer the central question of public service why be we here what do we believe in well for one thing we be here to see that government continue to serve the people and not the other way around yes government should do all that be necessary but only that which be necessary
 we do not lump people by group or special interest and let i add in the party of lincoln there be no room for intolerance and not even a small corner for anti semitism or bigotry of any kind many people be welcome in our house but not the bigot
 we believe in the uniqueness of each individual we believe in the sacredness of human life for some time now we have all fall into a pattern of describe our choice as left or right it be become standard rhetoric in discussion of political philosophy but be that really an accurate description of the choice before we
 go back a few year to the origin of the term and see where left or right would take we if we continue far enough in either direction stalin hitler one would take we to communist totalitarianism the other to the totalitarianism of hitler
 be not our choice really not one of left or right but of up or down down through the welfare state to statism to more and more government largesse accompany always by more government authority less individual liberty and ultimately totalitarianism always advance as for our own good the alternative be the dream conceive by our founding father up to the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with an orderly society
 we do not celebrate dependence day on the fourth of july we celebrate independence day
 we celebrate the right of each individual to be recognize as unique possess of dignity and the sacred right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness at the same time with our independence go a generosity of spirit more evident here than in almost any other part of the world recognize the equality of all man and woman we be willing and able to lift the weak cradle those who hurt and nurture the bond that tie we together as one nation under god
 finally we be here to shield our liberty not just for now or for a few year but forever
 could i share a personal thought with you tonight because tonight 's kind of special to i it be the last time of course that i will address you under these same circumstance i hope you will invite i back to future convention nancy and i will be forever grateful for the honor you have do we for the opportunity to serve and for your friendship and trust
 i begin political life as a democrat cast my first vote in 1932 for franklin delano roosevelt that year the democrats call for a 25 percent reduction in the cost of government by abolish useless commission and office and consolidate department and bureau and give more authority to state government as the year go by and those promise be forget do i leave the democratic party or do the leadership of that party leave not just i but million of patriotic democrats who believe in the principle and philosophy of that platform
 one of the first to declare this be a former democratic nominee for president al smith the happy warrior who go before the nation in 1936 to say on television or on radio that he could no long follow his party 's leadership and that he be take a walk as democratic leader have take their party far and far away from its first principle it be no surprise that so many responsible democrats feel that our platform be close to their view and we welcome they to our side
 four year ago we raise a banner of bold color no pale pastel we proclaim a dream of an america that would be a shine city on a hill
 we promise that we would reduce the growth of the federal government and we have we say we intend to reduce interest rate and inflation and we have we say we would reduce taxis to provide incentive for individual and business to get our economy move again and we have we say there must be job with a future for our people not government make work program and in the last 19 month as i have say six ad a half million new job in the private sector have be create we say we would once again be respect throughout the world and we be we say we would restore our ability to protect our freedom on land sea and in the air and we have
 we bring to the american citizen in this election year a record of accomplishment and the promise of continuation
 we come together in a national crusade to make america great again and to make a new beginning well now it be all come together with our beloved nation at peace we be in the midst of a springtime of hope for america greatness lie ahead of we
 hold the olympic game here in the united states begin define the promise of this season
 all through the spring and summer we marvel at the journey of the olympic torch as it make its passage east to west over 9,000 mile by some 4,000 runner that flame cross a portrait of our nation
 from our gotham city new york to the cradle of liberty boston across the appalachian springtime to the city of the big shoulders chicago move south toward atlanta over to st. louis past its gateway arch across wheatfields into the stark beauty of the southwest and then up into the still snowcapped rockie and after circle the greening northwest it come down to california across the golden gate and finally into los angeles and all along the way that torch become a celebration of america and we all become participant in the celebration
 each new story be typical of this land of ours there be ansel stubbs a youngster of 99 who pass the torch in kansas to 4 year old katie johnson in pineville kentucky it come at 1 a.m. so hundred of people line the street with candle at tupelo mississippi at 7 a.m. on a sunday morning a robe church choir sing god bless america as the torch go by
 that torch go through the cumberland gap past the martin luther king jr. memorial down the santa fe trail and alongside billy the kid 's grave
 in richardson texas it be carry by a 14 year old boy in a special wheelchair in west virginia the runner come across a line of deaf child and let each one pass the torch for a few foot and at the end these youngster hand talk excitedly in their sign language crowd spontaneously begin singe america the beautiful or the battle hymn of the republic
 and then in san francisco a vietnamese immigrant his little son hold on his shoulder dodged photographer and policeman to cheer a 19 year old black man push an 88 year old white woman in a wheelchair as she carry the torch
 my friend that be america
 we cheer in los angeles as the flame be carry in and the giant olympic torch burst into a billow fire in front of the team the youth of 140 nation assemble on the floor of the coliseum and in that moment maybe you be strike as i be with the uniqueness of what be take place before a hundred thousand people in the stadium most of they citizen of our country and over a billion worldwide watch on television there be athlete represent 140 country here to compete in the one country in all the world whose people carry the bloodline of all those 140 country and more only in the united states be there such a rich mixture of race creed and nationality only in our melting pot
 and that bring to mind another torch the one that greet so many of our parent and grandparent just this past fourth of july the torch atop the statue of liberty be hoist down for replacement we can be forgive for think that maybe it be just wear out from light the way to freedom for 17 million new americans so now we will put up a new one
 the poet call miss liberty 's torch the lamp beside the golden door well that be the entrance to america and it still be and now you really know why we be here tonight
 the glistening hope of that lamp be still ours every promise every opportunity be still golden in this land and through that golden door our child can walk into tomorrow with the knowledge that no one can be deny the promise that be america
 her heart be full her door be still golden her future bright she have arm big enough to comfort and strong enough to support for the strength in her arm be the strength of her people she will carry on in the 80 unafraid unashamed and unsurpasse
 in this springtime of hope some light seem eternal america 's be
 thank you god bless you and god bless america

ms. ridings i be dorothy ridings president of the league of women voters the sponsor of tonight 's first presidential debate between republican ronald reagan and democrat walter mondale

 tonight 's debate mark the third consecutive presidential election in which the league be present the candidate for the nation 's high office in face to face debate

 our panelist be james wieghart national political correspondent for scripps howard news service diane sawyer correspondent for the cbs program 60 minutes and fred barnes national political correspondent for the baltimore sun barbara walters of abc news who be appear in her fourth presidential debate be our moderator barbara

 ms. walters thank you dorothy

 a few word as we begin tonight 's debate about the format the position of the candidate that be who answer question first and who give the last statement be determine by a toss of a coin between the two candidate mr. mondale win and that mean that he choose to give the final closing statement it mean too that the president will answer the first question first i hope that be clear if it be not it will become clear as the debate go on

 far the candidate will be address as they each want and will therefore be call mr. president and mr. mondale

 since there will also be a second debate between the two presidential candidate tonight will focus primarily on the economy and other domestic issue the debate itself be build around question from the panel in each of its segment a reporter will ask the candidate the same general question then and this be important each candidate will have the chance to rebut what the other have say and the final segment of the debate will be the closing segment and the candidate will each have 4 minute for their closing statement and as i have say mr. mondale will be the last person on the program to speak

 and now i would like to add a personal note if i may as dorothy ridings point out i have be involve now in four presidential debate either as a moderator or as a panelist in the past there be no problem in select panelist tonight however there be to have be four panelist participate in this debate

 the candidate be give a list of almost 100 qualified journalist from all the medium and could agree on only these three fine journalist as moderator and on behalf of my fellow journalist i very much regret as do the league of women voters that this situation have occur

 and now let we begin the debate with the first question from james wieghart mr. wieghart

 the nation 's economy

 mr. wieghart mr. president in 1980 you promise the american people in your campaign a balanced budget by 1983 we have now have more and big deficit in the 4 year you have be in office mr. president do you have a secret plan to balance the budget sometime in a second term and if so would you lay out that plan for we tonight

 the president i have a plan not a secret plan as a matter of fact it be the economic recovery program that we present when i take office in 1981

 it be true that early work with some very prominent economist i have come up during the campaign with an economic program that i think could rectify the great problem confront we the double digit inflation the high tax rate that i think be hurt the economy the stagflation that we be undergo before even the election day something that none of those economist have even predict have happen that the economy be so worsen that i be openly say that what we have think on the basis of our plan could have bring a balanced budget no that be no long possible

 so the plan that we have have and that we be follow be a plan that be base on growth in the economy recovery without inflation and reduce the share that the government be take from the gross national product which have become a drag on the economy

 already we have a recovery that have be go on for about 21 month to the point that we can now call it an expansion under that this year we have see a $ 21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year base mainly on the increase revenue the government be get without raise tax rate

 our tax cut we think be very instrumental in bring about this economic recovery we have reduce inflation to about a third of what it be the interest rate have come down about 9 or 10 point and we think must come down far in the last 21 month more than 6 million people have get job there have be create new job for those people to where there be now 105 million civilian work where there be only 99 million before 107 if you count the military

 so we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending the increase rate of increase in government spending which have come down from 17 to 6 percent and at the same time as the growth in the economy increase the revenue the government get without raise taxis those two line will meet and when they meet that be a balanced budget

 mr. wieghart mr. president the congressional budget office have some bad news the line be not about to meet accord to their projection they project that the budget deficit will continue to climb in the year 1989 they project a budget deficit of $ 273 billion

 in view of that and in view of the economic recovery we be now enjoy would it make sense to propose a tax increase or take some other fiscal measure to reduce that deficit now when time be relatively good

 the president the deficit be the result of excessive government spending i do not very frankly take seriously the congressional budget office projection because they have be wrong on virtually all of they include the fact that our recovery be not go to take place to begin with but it have take place

 but as i say we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent if the rate of increase in government spending can be hold at 5 percent we're not far from there by 1989 that would have reduce the budget deficit down to a $ 30 or $ 40 billion level at the same time if we can have a 4 percent recovery continue through that same period of time that will mean without an increase in tax rate that will mean $ 400 billion more in government revenue and so i think that the line can meet

 actually in constant dollar in the domestic side of the budget there have be no spending increase in the 4 year that we have be here

 mr. wieghart mr. mondale the carter mondale administration do not come close to balance the budget in its 4 year in office either despite the fact that president carter do promise a balanced budget during his term

 you have propose a plan combine tax increase and budgetary cut and other change in the administration of the government that would reduce the project budget deficit by two third to approximately $ 87 billion in 1989 that still be an enormous deficit that will be run for these 4 year what other step do you think should be take to reduce this deficit and position the country for economic growth

 mr. mondale one of the key test of leadership be whether one see clearly the nature of the problem confront by our nation and perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our time be what do we do about these enormous deficit

 i respect the president i respect the presidency and i think he know that but the fact of it be every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit have be off by billion and billion of dollar as a matter of fact over 4 year they have miss the mark by nearly $ 600 billion we be tell we would have a balanced budget in 1983 it be $ 200 billion deficit instead and now we have a major question face the american people as to whether we will deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery

 virtually every economic analysis that i have hear of include the distinguished congressional budget office which be respect by i think almost everyone say that even with historically high level of economic growth we will suffer a $ 263 billion deficit in other word it do not converge as the president suggest it get large even with growth

 what that mean be that we will continue to have devastating problem with foreign trade this be the bad trade year in american history by far our rural and farm friend will have continue devastation real interest rate the real cost of interest will remain very very high and many economist be predict that we be move into a period of very slow growth because the economy be taper off and may be a recession i get it down to a level below 2 percent of gross national product with a policy that be fair i have stand up and tell the american people that i think it be a real problem that it can destroy long term economic growth and i have tell you what i think should be do

 i think this be a test of leadership and i think the american people know the difference

 mr. wieghart mr. mondale one other way to attack the deficit be further reduction in spending the president have submit a number of proposal to congress to do just that and in many instance the house control by the democrats have oppose they be not it one aspect of leadership for prominent democrats such as yourself to encourage responsible reduction in spending and thereby reduce the deficit

 mr. mondale absolutely and i propose over a hundred billion dollar in cut in federal spending over 4 year but i be not go to cut it out of social security and medicare and student assistance and things—[applause]—that people need these people depend upon all of we for the little security that they have and i be not go to do it that way

 the rate of defense spending increase can be slow certainly we can find a coffeepot that cost something less than $ 7,000 and there be other way of squeeze this budget without constantly pick on our senior citizen and the most vulnerable in american life and that be why the congress include the republicans have not go along with the president 's recommendation

 ms. walters i would like to ask the audience please to refrain from applaud either side it just take away from the time for your candidate

 and now it be time for the rebuttal mr. president 1 minute for rebuttal

 the president yes i do not believe that mr. mondale have a plan for balance the budget he have a plan for raise taxis and as a matter of fact the big single tax increase in our nation 's history take place 1977 and for the 5 year previous to our take office taxis double in the united states and the budget increase $ 318 billion so there be no ratio between tax and balance a budget whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people you be take the same amount of money out of the private sector unless and until you bring down government 's share of what it be take

 with regard to social security i hope there will be more time than just this minute to mention that but i will say this a president should never say never but i be go to violate that rule and say never i will never stand for a reduction of the social security benefit to the people that be now get they

 ms. walters mr. mondale

 mr. mondale well that be exactly the commitment that be make to the american people in 1980 he would never reduce benefit and of course what happen right after the election be they propose to cut social security benefit by 25 percent reduce the adjustment for inflation cut out minimum benefit for the poor on social security remove educational benefit for dependent whose widow be trying???with widow try to get they through college everybody remember that people know what happen

 there be a difference i have fight for social security and medicare and for thing to help people who be vulnerable all my life and i will do it as president of the united states

 ms. walters thank you very much we will now begin with segment number two with my colleague diane sawyer ms. sawyer

 leadership qualities

 ms. sawyer mr. president mr. mondale the public opinion poll do suggest that the american people be most concerned about the personal leadership characteristic of the two candidate and each of you have question the other 's leadership ability mr. president you have say that mr. mondale 's leadership would take the country down the path of defeatism and despair and vice president bush have call he whine and hope for bad news and mr. mondale you have say that president reagan offer showmanship not leadership that he have not master what he must know to command his government

 i would like to ask each of you to substantiate your claim mr. mondale first give we specific to support your claim that president reagan be a showman not a leader have not master what he must know to be president after 4 year and then second tell we what personal leadership characteristic you have that he do not

 mr. mondale well first of all i think the first answer this evening suggest exactly what i be say there be no question that we face this massive deficit and almost everybody agree unless we get it down the chance for long term healthy growth be nil and it be also unfair to dump these tremendous bill on our child

 the president say it will disappear overnight because of some reason no one else believe that be the case i do and i be stand up to the issue with an answer that be fair i think that be what leadership be all about there be a difference between be a quarterback and a cheerleader and when there be a real problem a president must confront it

 what i be refer to of course in the comment that you refer to be the situation in lebanon now for three occasion one after another our embassy be assault in the same way by a truck with demolition the first time and i do not criticize the president because these thing can happen once and sometimes twice the second time the barrack in lebanon be assault as we all remember there be two or three commission report recommendation by the cia the state department and the other and the third time there be even a warning from the terrorist themselves

 now i believe that a president must command that white house and those who work for he it be the tough job on earth and you must master the fact and insist that thing that must be do be do i believe that the way in which i will approach the presidency be what be need because all my life that have be the way in which i have seek to lead and that be why in this campaign i be tell you exactly what i want to do i be answer your question i be try to provide leadership now before the election so that the american people can participate in that decision

 ms. sawyer you have say mr. mondale that the poll have give you low rating on leadership than president reagan because your message have fail to get through give that you have be in public office for so many year what account for the failure of your message to get through

 mr mondale well i think we be get well all the time and i think tonight as we contrast for the first time our differ approach to government to value to the leadership in this country i think as this debate go forward the american people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of we against each other and i think as a part of that process what i be try to say will come across and that be that we must lead we must command we must direct and a president must see it like it be he must stand for the value of decency that the american people stand for and he must use the power of the white house to try to control these nuclear weapon and lead this world toward a safe world

 ms. sawyer mr. president the issue be leadership in personal term first do you think as vice president bush say that mr. mondale 's campaign be one of whine and hope for bad news and second what leadership characteristic do you possess that mr. mondale do not

 the president well whether he do or not let i suggest my own idea about the leadership factor since you have ask it and incidentally i might say that with regard to the 25 percent cut in social security before i get to the answer to your question the only 25 percent cut that i know of be accompany that huge 1977 tax increase be a cut of 25 percent in the benefit for every american who be bear after 1916

 now leadership first of all i think you must have some principle you believe in in mine i happen to believe in the people and believe that the people be suppose to be dominant in our society that they not government be to have control of their own affair to the great extent possible with an orderly society

 now have that i think also that in leadership well i believe that you find people position such as i be in who have the talent and ability to do the thing that be need in the various department of government i do not believe that a leader should be spend his time in the oval office decide who be go to play tennis on the white house court and you let those people go with the guideline of overall policy not look over their shoulder and nitpick the manner in which they go at the job you be ultimately responsible however for that job

 but i also believe something else about that i believe that and when i become governor of california i start this and i continue it in this office that any issue that come before i i have instruct cabinet member and staff they be not to bring up any of the political ramification that might surround the issue i do not want to hear they i want to hear only argument as to whether it be good or bad for the people be it morally right and on that basis and that basis alone we make a decision on every issue

 now with regard to my feeling about why i think that his record bespoke his possible take we back to the same thing that we know under the previous administration his record be that he speak in praise of deficit several time say they be not to be abhor that as a matter of fact he at one time say he wish the deficit could be double because they stimulate the economy and help reduce unemployment

 ms. sawyer as a followup let i draw in another specific if i could a specific that the democrats have claim about your campaign that it be essentially base on imagery and one specific that they allege be that for instance recently you show up at the opening ceremony of a buffalo old age housing project when in fact your policy be to cut federal housing subsidy for the elderly yet you be there to have your picture take with they

 the president our policy be not to cut subsidy we have believe in partnership and that be an example of a partnership between not only local government and the federal government but also between the private sector that build that particular structure and this be what we have be try to do be involve the federal government in such partnership

 we be today subsidize housing for more than 10 million people and we be go to continue along that line we have no thought of throw people out into the snow whether because of age or need we have preserve the safety net for the people with true need in this country and it have be pure demagoguery that we have in some way shut off all the charitable program or many of they for the people who have real need the safety net be there and we be take care of more people than have ever be take care of before by any administration in this country

 ms. walters mr. mondale an opportunity for you to rebut

 mr. mondale well i guess i be remind a little bit of what will rogers once say about hoover he say it be not what he do not know that bother i it be what he know for sure that just be not so laughter the fact of it be the president 's budget seek to cut social security by 25 percent it be not an opinion it be a fact and when the president be ask the other day what do you want to cut in the budget he say cut those thing i ask for but do not get that be social security and medicare

 the second fact be that the housing unit for senior citizen that the president dedicate in buffalo be only make possible through a federal assistance program for senior citizen that the president 's budget seek to terminate so if he have have his way there would not have be any housing project there at all this administration have take a meat cleaver out in term of federal assist housing and the record be there we have to see the fact before we can draw conclusion

 ms. walters mr. president

 the president well let i just respond with regard to social security when we take office we discover that the program that the carter mondale administration have say would solve the fiscal problem of social security for the next 50 year would not solve they for 5 social security be due to go bankrupt before 1983

 any proposal that i make at that time be at the request of the chairman a democrat of one of the lead committee who say we have to do something before the program go broke and the check bounce and so we make a proposal and then in 1982 they use that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign and 3 day after the election in 1982 they come to we and say social security we know be break indeed we have to borrow $ 17 billion to pay the check and then i ask for a bipartisan commission which i have ask for from the beginning to sit down and work out a solution

 and so the whole matter of what to do with social security have be resolve by bipartisan legislation and it be on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century

 ms. walters mr. president we begin segment number three with fred barnes

 religion

 mr. barnes mr. president would you describe your religious belief note particularly whether you consider yourself a bear again christian and explain how these belief affect your presidential decision

 the president well i be raise to have a faith and a belief and have be a member of a church since i be a small boy in our particular church we do not use that term bear again so i do not know whether i would fit that that particular term but i have thank to my mother god rest her soul the firm possible belief and faith in god and i do not believe i believe i should say as lincoln once say that i could not i would be the most stupid man in the world if i think i could confront the duty of the office i hold if i could not turn to someone who be strong and great than all other and i do resort to prayer

 at the same time however i have not believe that prayer should be introduce into an election or be a part of a political campaign or religion a part of that campaign as a matter of fact i think religion become a part of this campaign when mr. mondale 's running mate say i be not a good christian

 so it do play a part in my life i have no hesitancy in say so and as i say i do not believe that i could carry on unless i have a belief in a high authority and a belief that prayer be answer

 mr. barnes give those belief mr. president why do not you attend service regularly either by go to church or by invite a minister to the white house as president nixon use to do or someone to camp david as president carter use to do

 the president the answer to your question be very simple about why i do not go to church i have go to church regularly all my life and i start to here in washington and now in the position i hold and in the world in which we live where embassies do get blow up in beirut we're suppose to talk about that on the debate the 21st i understand but i pose a threat to several hundred people if i go to church

 i know the threat that be make against i we all know the possibility of terrorism we have see the barricade that have have to be build around the white house and therefore i do not feel and my minister know this and support i in this position i do not feel that i have a right to go to church know that my be there could cause something of the kind that we have see in other place in beirut for example and i miss go to church but i think the lord understand applause

 ms. walters may i ask you please—[applause]—may i ask the audience please to refrain from applause fred your second question

 mr. barnes mr. mondale would you describe your religious belief and mention whether you consider yourself a bear again christian and explain how those belief would affect your decision as president

 mr. mondale first of all i accept president reagan 's affirmation of faith i be sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith and we be strengthen all of we by that fact

 i be a son of a methodist minister my wife be the daughter of a presbyterian minister and i do not know if i have be bear again but i know i be bear into a christian family and i believe i have sing at more wedding and more funeral than anybody ever to seek the presidency whether that help or not i do not know

 i have a deep religious faith our family do it be fundamental it be probably the reason that i be in politic i think our faith tell we instruct we about the moral life that we should lead and i think we be all together on that

 what bother i be this grow tendency to try to use one 's own personal interpretation of faith politically to question other faith and to try to use the instrumentality of government to impose those view on other all history tell we that that be a mistake

 when the republican platform say that from here on out we be go to have a religious test for judge before they be select for the federal court and then jerry falwell announce that that mean they get at least two justices of the supreme court i think that be an abuse of faith in our country

 this nation be the most religious nation on earth more people go to church and synagogue than any other nation on earth and it be because we keep the politician and the state out of the personal exercise of our faith that be why faith in the united states be pure and unpollute by the intervention of politician and i think if we want to continue as i do to have a religious nation let keep that line and never cross it

 ms. walters thank you mr. barnes next question we have time for rebuttal now

 mr. barnes i think i have a followup

 ms. walters yes i ask you if you do i be sorry

 mr. barnes yes i do

 ms. walters i think you waive it

 mr. barnes yes mr. mondale you have complain just now about jerry falwell and you have complain other time about other fundamentalist in politic correct i if i be wrong but i do not recall your ever complain about minister who be involve in the civil right movement or in the anti vietnam war demonstration or about black preacher who have be so involved in american politic be it only conservative minister that you object to

 mr. mondale no what i object applause]—what i object to what i object to be someone seek to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on other

 a minister who be in civil right or in the conservative movement because he believe his faith instruct he to do that i admire the fact that the faith speak to we and that we be moral people hopefully i accept and rejoice in it be when you try to use that to undermine the integrity of private political or private religious faith and the use of the state be where for the most personal decision in american life that be where i draw the line

 ms. walters thank you now mr. president rebuttal

 the president yes it be very difficult to rebut because i find myself in so much agreement with mr. mondale i too want that wall that be in the constitution of separation of church and state to remain there the only attack i have make be on people who apparently would break away at that wall from the government side use the government use the power of the court and so forth to hinder that part of the constitution that say the government shall not only not establish a religion it shall not inhibit the practice of religion and they have be use these thing to have government through court order inhibit the practice of religion a child want to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rule that they can not do it because it be school property these be the type of thing that i think have be happen in a kind of a secular way that have be erode that separation and i be oppose to that

 with regard to a platform on the supreme court i can only say one thing about that i have appoint one member to the supreme court sandra day o'connor i will stand on my record on that and if i have the opportunity to appoint any more i will do it in the same manner that i do in select she

 ms. walters mr. mondale your rebuttal please

 mr. mondale the platform to which the president refer in fact call for a religious test in the selection of judge and jerry falwell say that mean we get two or three judge and it would involve a religious test for the first time in american life

 let us take the example that the president cite i believe in prayer my family pray we have never have any difficulty find time to pray but do we want a constitutional amendment adopt of the kind propose by the president that get the local politician into the business of select prayer that our child must either recite in school or be embarrassed and ask to excuse themselves who would write the prayer what would it say how would it be resolve when those dispute occur

 it seem to i that a moment 's reflection tell you why the united states senate turn that amendment down because it will undermine the practice of honest faith in our country by politicize it we do not want that

 ms. walters thank you mr. mondale our time be up for this round

 we go into the second round of our questioning begin again with jim wieghart jim

 political issues

 mr. wieghart after that discussion this may be like go from the sublime to the ridiculous but here go i have a political question for you mr. mondale laughter

 poll indicate a massive change in the electorate away from the coalition that have long make the democratic party a majority blue collar worker young professional their child and much of the middle class now regard themselves as independent or republican instead of democrats and the gap the edge the democrats have in party registration seem to be narrow

 i would like to ask you mr. mondale what be cause this be the democratic party out of sync with the majority of americans and will it soon be replace as the majority party by the republicans what do you think need to be do about it as a democrat

 mr. mondale my answer be that this campaign be not over yet and when people vote i think you be go to see a very strong verdict by the american people that they favor the approach that i be talk about

 the american people want arm control they do not want this arm race and they do not want this deadly new effort to bring weapon into the heaven and they want an american foreign policy that lead toward a safe world

 the american people see this debt and they know it be get to come down and if it will not come down the economy be go to slow down maybe go into a recession they see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign import in this country that have cost over 3 million job give farmer the bad year in american history and they know this debt must come down as well because it be unfair to our child

 the american people want this environment protect they know that these toxic waste dump should have be clean up a long time ago and they know that people 's life and health be be risk because we have have an administration that have be totally insensitive to the law and the demand for the protection of the environment

 the american people want their child educate they want to get our edge back in science and they want a policy head by the president that help close this gap that be widen between the united states and europe and japan

 the american people want to keep open door they want those civil right law enforce they want the equal right amendment ratify they want equal pay for comparable effort for woman and they want it because they have understand from the beginning that when we open door we be all strong just as we be at the olympics

 i think as you make the case the american people will increasingly come to our cause

 mr. wieghart mr. mondale be not it possible that the american people have hear your message and they be listen but they be reject it

 mr. mondale well tonight we have the first debate over the deficit the president say it will disappear automatically i have say it be go to take some work i think the american people will draw their own conclusion

 secondly i have say that i will not support the cut in social security and medicare and the rest that the president have propose the president answer that it do not happen or if it do it be resolve later in a commission as the record develop i think it be go to become increasingly clear that what i be say and where i want to take this country be exactly where the country want to go and the comparison of approach be such that i think will lead to further strength

 mr. wieghart mr. president you and your party be benefit from what appear to be an erosion of the old democratic coalition but you have not lay out a specific agenda to take this shift beyond november 6th what be your program for america for the next decade with some specificity

 the president well again i be run on the record i think sometimes mr. mondale 's run away from his but i be run on the record of what we have ask for we will continue to try to get thing that we do not get in a program that have already bring the rate of spending of government down from 17 percent to 6.1 percent a program of return authority and autonomy to the local and state government that have be unjustly seize by the federal government and you might find those word in a democratic platform of some year ago i know because i be a democrat at that time and i leave the party eventually because i could no long follow the turn in the democratic leadership that take we down an entirely different path a path of centralize authority in the federal government lack trust in the american people

 i promise when we take office that we would reduce inflation we have to one third of what it be i promise that we would reduce taxis we do 25 percent across the board that barely hold even with if it do that much with the gigantic tax increase impose in 1977 but at least it take that burden away from they

 i say that we would create job for our people and we did—6 million in the last 20 or 21 month i say that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament reduction of arm and hopefully an elimination of nuclear weapon we have do that

 all of the thing that i say we would do from inflation be down interest rate be down unemployment fall all of those thing we have do and i think this be something the american people see

 i think they also know that we have a commission that come in a year ago with a recommendation on education on excellence in education and today without the federal government be involve other than pass on to they the school district the word from that commission we find 35 states with task force now deal with their educational problem we find that school be extend the curriculum to now have force teaching of mathematic and science and so forth all of these thing have bring an improvement in the college entrance exam for the first time in some 20 year

 so i think that many democrats be see the same thing this democrat see the leadership be not take we where we want to go

 mr. wieghart mr. president much of what you say affect the quality of life of many americans their income the way they live and so forth but there be an aspect to quality of life that lie beyond the private sector which have to do with our neighborhood our city our street our park our environment in those area i have difficulty see what your program be and what you feel the federal responsibility be in these area of the quality of life in the public sector that affect everybody and even enormous wealth by one individual can not create the kind of environment that he might like

 the president there be task that government legitimately should enforce and task that government perform well and you have name some of they crime have come down the last 2 year for the first time in many many decade that it have come down or since we have keep records—2 consecutive year and last year it come down the big drop in crime that we have have i think that we have have something to do with that just as we have with the drug problem nationwide

 the environment yes i feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment when we take office we find that the national park be so dirty and contain so many hazard lack of safety feature that we stop buy additional park land until we have rectify this with what be to be a 5 year program but it be just about finish already a billion dollar and now we be go back to budgeting for additional land for our park we have add million of acre to the wilderness land to the game refuge i think that we be out in front of most and i see that the red light be blink so i can not continue but i have get more

 ms. walters well you will have a chance when your rebuttal time come up perhaps mr. president mr. mondale now it be your turn for rebuttal

 mr. mondale the president say that when the democratic party make its turn he leave it the year that he decide we have lose our way be the year that john f. kennedy be run against richard nixon i be chairman of minnesotans for kennedy president reagan be chairman of a thing call democrats for nixon now maybe we make a wrong turn with kennedy but i will be proud of support he all of my life and i be very happy that john kennedy be elect because john kennedy look at the future with courage see what need to be do and understand his own government

 the president just say that his government be shrink it be not it be now the large peacetime government ever in term of the take from the total economy and instead of retreat instead of be strong where we should be strong he want to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal question in american life that be where government should not be

 ms. walters mr. president

 the president before i campaign as a democrat for a republican candidate for president i have already vote for dwight eisenhower to be president of the united states and so my change have come early than that i have not get around to reregistere as yet i find that be rather difficult to do but i finally do it

 there be some other thing that have be say here back and you say that i might be able to dredge they up mr. mondale refer to the farmer bad year the farmer be not the victim of anything this administration have do the farmer be the victim of the double digit inflation and the 21 1/2 percent interest rate of the carter mondale administration and the grain embargo which destroy our reliability nationwide as a supplier all of these thing be presently be rectify and i think that we be go to salvage the farmer as a matter of fact there have be less than one quarter of i percent of foreclosure of the 270,000 loan from government that the farmer have

 ms. walters thank you mr. president we will now turn to diane sawyer for her round of question diane

 abortion

 ms. sawyer i would like to turn to an area that i think few people enjoy discuss but that we probably should tonight because the position of the two candidate be so clearly different and lead to very different policy consequence and that be abortion and right to life i be explore for your personal view of abortion and specifically how you would want they apply as public policy

 first mr. president do you consider abortion murder or a sin and second how hard would you work what kind of priority would you give in your second term legislation to make abortion illegal and specifically would you make certain as your party platform urge that federal justice that you appoint be pro life

 the president i have believe that in the appointment of judge that all that be specify in the party platform be that they respect the sanctity of human life now that i would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue have to do with human life but with regard to abortion and i have a feeling that this be there be be some reference without name it here in the remark of mr. mondale tie to inject religion into government with i abortion be not a problem of religion it be a problem of the constitution

 i believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child be not a live human being then that child be already protect by the constitution which guarantee life liberty and the pursuit of happiness to all of we and i think that this be what we should concentrate on be try i know there be week and week of testimony before a senate committee there be medical authority there be religious there be cleric there everyone talk about this matter of pro life and at the end of all of that not one shred of evidence be introduce that the unborn child be not alive we have see premature birth that be now grow up happy people go around

 also there be a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our court rule that abortion be not the taking of a human life in california sometime ago a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child be bear dead with a fractured skull and the california state legislature unanimously pass a law that be sign by the then democratic governor sign a law that say that any man who so abuse a pregnant woman that he cause the death of her unborn child shall be charge with murder now be not it strange that that same woman could have take the life of her unborn child and it be abortion and not murder but if somebody else do it that be murder and it use the term death of the unborn child

 so this have be my feeling about abortion that we have a problem now to determine and all the evidence so far come down on the side of the unborn child be a live human being

 ms. sawyer a two part followup do i take it from what you have say about the platform then that you do not regard the language and do not regard in your own appointment abortion position a test of any kind for justice that it should be and also if abortion be make illegal how would you want it enforce who would be the police unit that would investigate and would you want the woman who have abortion to be prosecute

 the president the law regard that always be state law it be only when the supreme court hand down a decision that the federal government intervene in what have always be a state policy our law against murder be state law so i would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this

 as i say i feel that we have a problem here to resolve and no one have approach it from that matter it do not happen that the church that i belong to have that as part of its dogma i know that some church do

 now it be a sin if you be take a human life at the same time in our judeo christian tradition we recognize the right of take a human life in self defense and therefore i have always believe that a mother if medically it be determined that her life be at risk if she go through with the pregnancy she have a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own

 ms. sawyer mr. mondale to turn to you do you consider abortion a murder or a sin and bridge from what president reagan say he have write that if society do not know whether life do human life in fact do begin at conception as long as there be a doubt that the unborn child should at least be give the benefit of the doubt and that there should be protection for that unborn child

 mr. mondale this be one of the most emotional and difficult issue that could possibly be debate i think your question however underscore the fact there be probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private life of the american people

 the constitutional amendment propose by president reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she have be rape or suffer from incest be it really the view of the american people however you feel on the question of abortion that government ought to be reach into your living room and make choice like this i think it can not work will not work and will lead to all kind of cynical evasion of the law those who can afford to have they will continue to have they the disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they use to do

 i think these question be inherently personal and moral and every individual instance be different every american should be aware of the seriousness of the step but there be some thing that government can do and some thing they can not do

 now the example that the president cite have nothing to do with abortion somebody go to a woman and nearly kill she that be always be a serious crime and always should be a serious crime but how do that compare with the problem of a woman who be rape do we really want those decision make by judge who have be pick because they will agree to find the person guilty i do not think so and i think it be go in exactly the wrong direction

 in america on basic moral question we have always let the people decide in their own personal life we have not feel so insecure that we have reach for the club of state to have our point of view it be be a good instinct and we be the most religious people on earth

 one final point president reagan as governor of california sign a bill which be perhaps the most liberal pro abortion bill of any state in the union

 ms. sawyer but if i can get you back for a moment on my point which be the question of when human life begin a two part followup first of all at what point do you believe that human life begin in the growth of a fetus and second of all you say that government should not be involve in the decision yet there be those who would say that government be involve and the consequence of the involvement be 1.5 million abortion in 1980 and how do you feel about that

 mr. mondale the basic decision of the supreme court be that each person have to make this judgment in her own life and that be the way it be be do and it be a personal and private moral judgment i do not know the answer to when life begin and it be not that simple either you have get another life involve and if it be rape how do you draw moral judgment on that if it be incest how do you draw moral judgment on that do every woman in america have to present herself before some judge pick by jerry falwell to clear her personal judgment it will not work applause

 ms. walters i be sorry to do this but i really must talk to the audience

 you be all invite guest i know i be waste time in talk to you but it really be very unfair of you to applaud sometimes louder less loud and i ask you as people who be invite here and polite people to refrain

 we have our time now for rebuttal mr. president

 the president yes well with regard to this be a personal choice be not that what a murderer be insist on his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justify that

 now i be not capable and i do not think you be any of we to make this determination that must be make with regard to human life i be simply say that i believe that that be where the effort should be direct to make that determination

 i do not think that any of we should be call upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other thing might come under the self defense tradition that too would have to be work out then when you once recognize that we be talk about a life but in this great society of ours would not it make a lot more sense in this gentle and kind society if we have a program that make it possible for when incident come along in which someone feel they must do away with that unborn child that instead we make it available for the adoption there be a million and a half people out there stand in line wait to adopt child who can not have they any other way

 ms. walters mr. mondale

 mr. mondale i agree with that and that be why i be a principal sponsor of a liberal adoption law so that more of these child could come to term so that the young mother be educate so we find an option an alternative i be all for that but the question be whether this other option propose by the president should be pursue and i do not agree with it

 since i have get about 20 second let i just say one thing the question of agriculture come up a minute ago net farm income be off 50 percent in the last 3 year and every farmer know it and the effect of these economic policy be like a massive grain embargo which have cause farm export to drop 20 percent it be be a big failure i oppose the grain embargo in my administration i be opposed to these policy as well

 ms. walters i be sit here like the great schoolteacher let you both get away with thing because one do it the other one do it may i ask in the future that the rebuttal stick to what the rebuttal be and also foreign policy will be the next debate stop drag it in by its ear into this one laughter

 now having admonish you i would like to say to the panel you be allow one question and one followup would you try as well you could not to ask two and three i know it be something we all want to do two and three question as part one and two and three as part two having say that fred it be your

 federal taxation

 mr. barnes thank you mr. mondale let i ask you about middle class americans and the taxis they pay now i be talk not about the rich or the poor i know your view on their taxis but about family earn $ 25,000 to $ 45,000 a year do you think that those family be overtax or undertaxe by the federal government

 mr. mondale in my opinion as we deal with this deficit people from about $ 70,000 a year on down have to be deal with very very carefully because they be the one who do not get any relief the first time around

 under the 1981 tax bill people make $ 200,000 a year get $ 60,000 in tax relief over 3 year while people make $ 30,000 a year all taxis consider get no relief at all or their taxis actually go up that be why my proposal protect everybody from $ 25,000 a year or less against any tax increase and treat those $ 70,000 and under in a way that be more beneficial than the way the president propose with a sale tax or a fiat tax

 what do this mean in real life well the other day vice president bush disclose his tax return to the american people he be one of the wealthy americans and he be our vice president in 1981 i think he pay about 40 percent in taxis in 1983 as a result of these tax preference he pay a little over 12 percent 12.8 percent in taxis that mean that he pay a low percent in taxis than the janitor who clean up his office or the chauffeur who drive he to work

 i believe we need some fairness and that be why i have propose what i think be a fair and a responsible proposal that help protect these people who have already get no relief or actually get a tax increase

 mr. barnes it sound as if you be say you think this group of taxpayer make $ 25,000 to $ 45,000 a year be already overtax yet your tax proposal would increase their taxis i think your aide have say those earn about $ 25,000 to $ 35,000 their tax rate would go up their tax bill would go up a hundred dollar and from $ 35,000 to $ 45,000 more than that several hundred dollar would not that stifle their incentive to work and invest and so on and also hurt the recovery

 mr. mondale the first thing be everybody $ 25,000 and under would have no tax increase

 mr. reagan after the election be go to have to propose a tax increase and you will have to compare what he propose and his secretary of the treasury say he be study a sale tax or a value add tax they be the same thing they hit middle- and moderate income americans and leave wealthy americans largely untouched

 up until about $ 70,000 as you go up the ladder my proposal will be far more beneficial as soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well i would like to see the total repeal of indexing i do not think we can do that for a few year but at some point we want to do that as well

 mr. barnes mr. president let i try this on you do you think middle income americans be overtax or undertaxed

 the president you know i be not go to say this at all but i can not help it there you go again laughter i do not have a plan to tax or increase taxis i be not go to increase taxis i can understand why you be mr. mondale because as a senator you vote 16 time to increase taxis

 now i believe that our problem have not be that anybody in our country be undertaxed it be that government be overfe and i think that most of our people this be why we have a 25 percent tax cut across the board which maintain the same progressivity of our tax structure in the bracket on up and as a matter of fact it just so happen that in the quirk of administer these taxis those above $ 50,000 actually do not get quite as big a tax cut percentage wise as do those from $ 50,000 down from $ 50,000 down those people pay two third of the taxis and those people get two third of the tax cut

 now the social security tax of 77 this indeed be a tax that hit people in the low bracket the hard it have two feature it have several tax increase phase in over a period of time there be two more yet to come between now and 1989 at the same time every year it increase the amount of money virtually every year there may have be one or two that be skip in there that be subject to that tax today it be up to about $ 38,000 of earning that be subject to the payroll tax for social security and that tax there be no deduction so a person make anywhere from 10 15 20 they're pay that tax on the full gross earning that they have after they have already pay an income tax on that same amount of money

 now i do not think that to try and say that we be tax the rich and not the other way around it just do not work out that way the system be still where it be with regard to the progressivity as i have say and that have not be change but if you take it in number of dollar instead of percentage yes you could say well that person get 10 time as much as this other person yes but he pay 10 time as much also but if you take it in percentage then you find out that it be fair and equitable across the board

 mr. barnes i think i catch mr. president a glimmer of a strong statement there in your answer than you have make before i think the operative position you have before be that you would only raise taxis in a second term as a last resort and i think you say flatly that i be not go to raise taxis be that what you mean to say that you will not that you will flatly not raise taxis in your second term as president

 the president yes i have used—"last resort would always be with i if you get the government down to the low level that you yourself could say it could not go any lower and still perform the service for the people and if the recovery be so complete that you know you be get the ultimate amount of revenue that you could get through that growth and there be still some slight difference there between those two line then i have say once that yes you would have to then look to see if taxis should not be adjust

 i do not foresee those thing happen so i say with great confidence i be not go to go for a tax

 with regard to assail mr. bush about his tax problem and the difference from the tax he once pay and then the later tax he pay i think if you look at the deduction there be great legal expense in there have to do possibly with the sale of his home and they have to do with his setting up of a blind trust all of those be legally deduction deductible in compute your tax and it be a 1 year thing with he

 ms. walters mr. mondale here we go again it be time for rebuttal

 mr. mondale well first of all i give he the benefit of the doubt on the house deal i be just talk about the 12.8 percent that he pay and that be what be happen all over this country with wealthy americans they have get so many loophole they do not have to pay much in taxis

 now mr. president you say there you go again right

 the president yes

 mr. mondale you remember the last time you say that

 the president mm hmm

 mr. mondale you say it when president carter say that you be go to cut medicare and you say oh no there you go again mr. president and what do you do right after the election you go out and try to cut $ 20 billion out of medicare and so when you say there you go again"—people remember this you know laughter and people will remember that you sign the big tax increase in the history of california and the big tax increase in the history of the united states and what be you go to do you have get a $ 260 billion deficit you can not wish it away you will not slow defense spending you refuse to do that

 ms. walters mr. mondale i be afraid your time be up

 mr. mondale sorry

 ms. walters mr. president

 the president yes with regard to medicare no but it be time for we to say that medicare be in pretty much the same condition that social security be and something be go to have to be do in the next several year to make it fiscally sound and no i never propose any $ 20 billion should come out of medicare i have propose that the program we must treat with that particular problem and maybe part of that problem be because during the 4 year of the carter mondale administration medical cost in this country go up 87 percent

 ms. walters all right fine

 the president i give you back some of that time laughter

 ms. walters we can not keep go back for other rebuttal there will be time later

 we now go to our final round the way thing stand now we have time for only two set of question and by lot it will be jim and diane and we will start with jim wieghart

 social welfare programs

 mr. wieghart mr. president the economic recovery be real but uneven the census bureau just a month ago report that there be more people live under poverty now a million more people live under it than when you take office

 there have be a number of study include study by the urban institute and other nonpolitical organization that say that the impact of the tax and budget cut and your economic policy have impact severely on certain class of americans work mother head of household minority group elderly poor in fact they be say the rich be get rich and the poor be get poor under your policy

 what relief can you offer to the work poor to the minority and to the woman head of household who have bear the brunt of these economic program what can you offer they in the future in your next term

 the president well some of those fact and figure just do not stand up yes there have be an increase in poverty but it be a low rate of increase than it be in the precede year before we get here it have begin to decline but it be still go up

 on the other hand woman head of household single woman head of household have for the first time there be be a turndown in the rate of poverty for they we have find also in our study that in this increase in poverty it all have to do with their private earning it have nothing to do with the transfer of payment from government by way of many program

 we be spend now 37 percent more on food for the hungry in all the various type of program than be spend in 1980 we be spend a third more on all of the well all of the program of human service we have more people receive food stamp than be ever receive they before—2,300,000 more be receive they even though we take 850,000 off the food stamp roll because they be make an income that be above anything that warrant their fellow citizen have to support they we find people make 185 percent of the poverty level be get government benefit we have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy

 some time ago mr. mondale say something about education and college student and help of that kind half one out of two of the full time college student in the united states be receive some form of federal aid but there again we find people that there under the previous administration family that have no limit to income be still eligible for low interest college loan we do not think that be right and so we have set a standard that those loan and those grant be direct to the people who otherwise could not go to college their family income be so low

 so there be a host of other figure that reveal that the grant program be great than they have ever be take care of more people than they ever have 7.7 million elderly citizen who be live in the low 20 percent of earnings—7.7 million have move up into another bracket since our administration take over leave only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there have be more than 13 million

 mr. wieghart mr. president in a visit to texas in brownsville i believe it be in the rio grande valley you do observe that the economic recovery be uneven

 the president yes

 mr. wieghart in that particular area of texas unemployment be over 14 percent whereas statewide it be the low in the country i believe—5.6 percent and you make the comment however that man do not live by bread alone what do you mean by that comment and if i interpret it correctly it would be a comment more address to the affluent who obviously can look beyond just the bread they need to sustain they with their wherewithal

 the president that have nothing to do with the other thing of talk about their need or anything i remember distinctly i be segue into another subject i be talk about the thing that have be accomplish and that be refer to the revival of patriotism and optimism the new spirit that we be find all over america and it be a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people so that be the only place that that be use

 i do avoid i be afraid in my previous answer also the idea of uneven yes there be no way that the recovery be even across the country just as in the depth of the recession there be some part of the country that be bad off but some that do not even feel the pain of the recession

 we be not go to rest and not go to be happy until every person in this country who want a job can have one until the recovery be complete across the country

 mr. wieghart mr. mondale as you can gather from the question to the president the celebrate war on poverty obviously do not end the problem of poverty although it may have dent it the poor and the homeless and the disadvantaged be still with we what should the federal government 's role be to turn back the growth in the number of people live below the poverty level which be now 35 million in the united states and to help deal with the structural unemployment problem that the president be refer to in an uneven recovery

 mr. mondale number one we have get to get the debt down to get the interest rate down so the economy will grow and people will be employ

 number two we have to work with city and other to help generate economic growth in those community through the urban development action grant program i do not mind those enterprise zone let us try they but not as a substitute for the other certainly education and training be crucial if these young americans do not have the skill that make they attractive to employee they be not go to get job

 the next thing be to try to get more entrepreneurship in business within the reach of minority so that these business be locate in the community in which they be find the other thing be we need the business community as well as government heavily involve in these community to try to get economic growth

 there be no question that the poor be bad off i think the president genuinely believe that they be well off but the figure show that about 8 million more people be below the poverty line than 4 year ago how you can cut school lunch how you can cut student assistance how you can cut housing how you can cut disability benefit how you can do all of these thing and then the people receive they for example the disabled who have no alternative how they be go to do well i do not know now we need a tight budget but there be no question that this administration have single out thing that affect the most vulnerable in american life and they be hurt

 one final point if i might there be another part of the lopsided economy that we be in today and that be that these heavy deficit have kill export and be swamp the nation with cheap import we be now $ 120 billion of import 3 million job lose and farmer be have their bad year that be another reason to get the deficit down

 mr. wieghart mr. mondale be it possible that the vast majority of americans who appear to be prosperous have lose interest in the kind of program you be discuss to help those less privileged than they be

 mr. mondale i think the american people want to make certain that that dollar be wisely spend i think they stand for civil right i know they be all for education in science and training which i strongly support they want these young people to have a chance to get job and the rest i think the business community want to get involve i think they be ask for new and creative way to try to reach it with everyone involve i think that be part of it i think also that the american people want a balanced program that give we long term growth so that they be not have to take money that be desperate to themselves and their family and give it to someone else i be oppose to that too

 ms. walters and now it be time for our rebuttal for this period mr. president

 the president yes the connection that be be make again between the deficit and the interest rate there be no connection between they there be a connection between interest rate and inflation but i would call to your attention that in 1981 while we be operate still on the carter mondale budget that we inherit that the interest rate come down from 21 1/2 down toward the 12 or 13 figure and while they be come down the deficit have start their great increase they be go up now if there be a connection i think that there would be a different parallel between deficit get large and interest rate go down

 the interest rate be base on inflation and right now i have to tell you i do not think there be any excuse for the interest rate be as high as they be because we have bring inflation down so low i think it can only be that they be anticipate or hope expect not hope that maybe we do not have a control of inflation and it be go to go back up again well it be not go to go back up we be go to see that it do not

 and i have not get time to answer with regard to the disabled

 ms. walters thank you mr. president mr. mondale

 mr. mondale mr. president if i hear you correctly you say that these deficit do not have anything to do with interest rate i will grant you that interest rate be too high in 1980 and we can have another debate as to why energy price and so on there be no way of gloss around that but when these huge deficit go in place in 1981 what be call the real interest rate the spread between inflation and what a loan cost you double and that be still the case today and the result be interest cost that have never be see before in term of real charge and it be attributable to the deficit

 everybody every economist every businessman believe that your own council of economic advisers mr. feldstein in his report tell you that every chairman of the finance and ways and means committee republican leader in the senate and the house be tell you that that deficit be ruin the long term hope for this economy it be cause high interest rate it be ruin we in trade it be give we the high small business failure in 50 year the economy be start downhill with housing failure

 ms. walters thank you mr. mondale you be both very obedient i have to give you credit for that

 we now start our final round of question we do want to have time for your rebuttal
 we start with diane diane sawyer

 presidential campaign

 ms. sawyer since we be reach the end of the question period and since in every presidential campaign the candidate tend to complain that the opposition candidate be not hold accountable for what he or she say let i give you the chance to do that

 mr. mondale begin with you what do you think the most outrageous thing be your opponent say in this debate tonight laughter

 mr. mondale do you want to give i some suggestion laughter i be go to use my time a little differently i be go to give the president some credit i think the president have do some thing to raise the sense of spirit morale good feeling in this country and he be entitle to credit for that what i think we need however be not just that but to move forward not just congratulate ourselves but challenge ourselves to get on with the business of deal with america 's problem

 i think in education when he lecture the country about the importance of discipline i do not like it at first but i think it help a little bit but now we need both that kind of discipline and the resource and the consistent leadership that allow this country to catch up in education and science and training

 i like president reagan and this be not personal there be deep difference about our future and that be the basis of my campaign

 ms. sawyer follow up in a similar vein then what remain question would you most like to see your opponent force to answer

 mr. mondale without any doubt i have stand up and tell the american people that that $ 263 billion deficit must come down and i have do what no candidate for president have ever do i tell you before the election what i would do

 mr. reagan as you see tonight president reagan take the position it will disappear by magic it be once call voodoo economic i wish the president would say yes the cbo be right yes we have a $ 263 billion deficit this be how i be go to get it do do not talk about growth because even though we need growth that be not help it be go to go in the other direction as they have estimate

 and give we a plan what will you cut whose taxis will you raise will you finally touch that defense budget be you go to go after social security and medicare and student assistance and the handicapped again as you do last time if you would just tell we what you be go to do then the american people could compare my plan for the future with your plan and that be the way it should be the american people would be in charge

 ms. sawyer mr. president the most outrageous thing your opponent have say in the debate tonight

 the president well now i have to start with a smile since his kind word to i

 i will tell you what i think have be the most outrageous thing in political dialog both in this campaign and the one in 82 and that be the continued discussion and claim that somehow i be the villain who be go to pull the social security check out from those people who be dependent on they

 and why i think it be outrageous first of all it be not true but why it be outrageous be because for political advantage every time they do that they scare million of senior citizen who be totally dependent on social security have no place else to turn and they have to live and go to bed at night thinking be this true be someone go to take our check away from we and leave we destitute and i do not think that that should be a part of political dialog

 now to i still i just have a minute here

 ms. walters you have more time

 the president oh i

 ms. walters you can keep go

 the president okay all right

 now social security let us lay it to rest once and for all i tell you never would i do such a thing but i tell you also now social security have nothing to do with the deficit social security be totally fund by the payroll tax levy on employer and employee if you reduce the out go of social security that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit it would go into the social security trust fund so social security have nothing to do with balance a budget or erase or lower the deficit

 now again to get to whether i be depend on magic i think i have talk in straight economic term about a program of recovery that i be tell would not work and then after it work i be tell that lower taxis would increase inflation and none of these thing happen it be work and we be go to continue on that same line

 as to what we might do and find in further saving cut no we be not go to starve the hungry but we have 2,478 specific recommendation from a commission of more than 2,000 business people in this country through the grace commission that we be study right now and we have already implement 17 percent of they that be recommendation as to how to make government more efficient more economic

 ms. sawyer and to keep it even what remain question would you most like to see your opponent force to answer

 the president why the deficit be so much of a problem for he now but that in 1976 when the deficit be $ 52 billion and everyone be panic about that he say no that he think it ought to be big because a big deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment in 1979 he make similar statement the same effect that the deficit there be nothing wrong with have deficit

 remember there be a trillion dollar in debt before we get here that be get to be pay by our child and grandchild too if we do not do it and i be hope we can start some payment on it before we get through here that be why i want another 4 year

 ms. walters well we have time now if you would like to answer the president 's question or whatever rebuttal

 mr. mondale well we have just finish almost the whole debate and the american people do not have the slight clue about what president reagan will do about these deficit laughter and yet that be the most important single issue of our time

 i do support the 76 measure that he tell about because we be in a deep recession and we need some stimulation but i will say as a democrat i be a real piker mr. president in 1979 we run a $ 29 billion deficit all year this administration seem to run that every morning and the result be exactly what we see this economy be start to run downhill housing be off last report on new purchase it be the low since 1982 growth be a little over 3 percent now many people be predict a recession and the flow of import into this country be swamp the american people

 we have get to deal with this problem and those of we who want to be your president should tell you now what we be go to do so you can make a judgment

 ms. walters thank you very much we must stop now i want to give you time for your closing statement it be indeed time for that from each of you we will begin with president reagan

 oh i be sorry mr. reagan you have your rebuttal and i just cut you off because our time be go you have a chance now for rebuttal before your closing statement be that correct

 the president no i might as well just go with-

 ms. walters do you want to go with your

 the president i do not think so i be all confused now

 ms. walters technically you do i have little voice that come in my ear laughter you do not get those same voice i be not hear it from here i'm hear it from here

 the president all right

 ms. walters you have waive your rebuttal you can go with your closing statement

 closing statement

 the president well we will include it in that

 ms. walters okay

 the president four year ago in similar circumstance to this i ask you the american people a question i ask be you well off than you be 4 year before the answer to that obviously be no and as the result i be elect to this office and promise a new beginning

 now maybe i be expect to ask that same question again i be not go to because i think that all of you or not everyone those people that be in those pocket of poverty and have not catch up they could not answer the way i would want they to but i think that most of the people in this country would say yes they be well off than they be 4 year ago

 the question i think should be enlarge be america well off than it be 4 year ago and i believe the answer to that have to also be yes i promise a new beginning so far it be only a beginning if the job be finish i might have think twice about seek reelection for this job

 but we now have an economy that for the first time well let us put it this way in the first half of 1980 gross national product be down a minus 3.7 percent the first half of 84 it be up 8 1/2 percent productivity in the first half of 1980 be down a minus 2 percent today it be up a plus 4 percent

 personal earning after taxis per capita have go up almost $ 3,000 in these 4 year in 1980 or 1979 a person with a fix income of $ 8,000 be $ 500 above the poverty line and this maybe explain why there be the number still in poverty by 1980 that same person be $ 500 below the poverty line

 we have restore much of our economy with regard to business investment it be high than it have be since 1949 so there seem to be no shortage of investment capital we have as i say cut the taxis but we have reduce inflation and for 2 year now it have stay down there not at double digit but in the range of 4 or below we believe that we have also promise that we would make our country more secure

 yes we have an increase in the defense budget but back then we have plane that could not fly for lack of spare part or pilot we have navy vessel that could not leave harbor because of lack of crew or again lack of spare part today we be well on our way to a 600 ship navy we have 543 at present

 we have our military the morale be high i think the people should understand that two third of the defense budget pay for pay and salary or pay and pension and then you add to that food and wardrobe and all the other thing and you only have a small portion go for weapon but i be determined that if ever our man be call on they should have the good that we can provide in the manner of tool and weapon there have be reference to expensive spare part hammer cost $ 500 well we be the one who find those

 i think we have give the american people back their spirit i think there be an optimism in the land and a patriotism and i think that we be in a position once again to heed the word of thomas paine who say we have it in our power to begin the world over again

 ms. walters thank you mr. reagan

 mr. mondale the closing word be now your

 mr. mondale i want to thank the league of women voters and the city of louisville for host this evening 's debate i want to thank president reagan for agree to debate he do not have to and he do and we all appreciate it

 the president 's favorite question be be you well off well if you be wealthy you be well off if you be middle income you be about where you be and if you be modest income you be bad off that be what the economist tell we

 but be that really the question that should be ask be not the real question be will we be well off will our child be well off be we build the future that this nation need i believe that if we ask those question that bear on our future not just congratulate ourselves but challenge we to solve those problem you will see that we need new leadership

 be we well of with this arm race will we be well off if we start this star war escalation into the heaven be we well off when we de emphasize our value in human right be we well off when we load our child with this fantastic debt would father and mother feel proud of themselves if they load their child with debt like this nation be now over a trillion dollar on the shoulder of our child can we say really say that we will be well off when we pull away from sort of that basic american instinct of decency and fairness

 i would rather lose a campaign about decency than win a campaign about self interest i do not think this nation be compose of people who care only for themselves and when we seek to assault social security and medicare as the record show we do i think that be mean spirited when we terminate 400,000 desperate hopeless defenseless americans who be on disability confused and unable to defend themselves and just lay they out on the street as we do for 4 year i do not think that be what america be all about

 america be a fair society and it be not right that vice president bush pay less in taxis than the janitor who help he i believe there be fundamental fairness cry out that need to be achieve in our tax system

 i believe that we will be well off if we protect this environment and contrary to what the president say i think their record on the environment be inexcusable and often shameful these law be not be enforce have not be enforce and the public health and the air and the water be pay the price that be not fair for our future

 i think our future require a president to lead we in an all out search to advance our education our learning and our science and training because this world be more complex and we be be press hard all the time

 i believe in open door we win the olympics in part because we have have civil right law and the law that prohibit discrimination against woman i have be for those effort all my life the president 's record be quite different

 the question be our future president kennedy once say in response to similar argument we be great but we can be great we can be well if we face our future rejoice in our strength face our problem and by solve they build a well society for our child

 thank you

 ms. walters thank you mr. mondale applause please we have not finish quite yet

 our panelist for tonight 's debate on defense and foreign policy issue be georgie anne geyer syndicate columnist for universal press syndicate marvin kalb chief diplomatic correspondent for nbc news morton kondracke executive editor of the new republic magazine and henry trewhitt diplomatic correspondent for the baltimore sun edwin newman formerly of nbc news and now a syndicate columnist for king features be our moderator ed

 mr newman dorothy ridings thank you a brief word about our procedure tonight the first question will go to mr. mondale he will have two and a half minute to reply then the panel member who put the question will ask a followup the answer to that will be limit to one minute after that the same question will be put to president reagan again there will be a followup and then each man will have one minute for rebuttal the second question will go to president reagan first after that the alternating will continue at the end there will be four minute summation with president reagan go last

 we have ask the questioner to be brief let us begin ms. geyer your question to mr. mondale



 central america

 ms geyer mr. mondale two relate question on the crucial issue of central america you and the democratic party have say that the only policy toward the horrendous civil war in central america should be on the economic development and negotiation with perhaps a quarantine of marxist nicaragua do you believe that these answer would in any way solve the bitter conflict there do you really believe that there be no need to resort to force at all be not the solution to central america 's gnawing problem simply again too weak and too late

 mr mondale i believe that the question oversimplify the difficulty of what we must do in central america our objective ought to be to strengthen the democracy to stop communist and other extremist influence and stabilize the community in that area to do that we need a three pronged attack one be military assistance to our friend who be be pressure secondly a strong and sophisticated economic aid program and human right program that offer a well life and a sharp alternative to the alternative offer by the totalitarian who oppose we and finally a strong diplomatic effort that pursue the possibility of peace in the area

 that be one of the big disagreement that we have with the president that they have not pursue the diplomatic opportunity either within el salvador or as between the country and have lose time during which we might have be able to achieve a peace

 this bring up the whole question of what presidential leadership be all about i think the lesson in central america this recent embarrassment in nicaragua where we be give instruction for hire assassin hire criminal and the rest all of this have strengthen our opponent

 a president must not only assure that we be tough but we must also be wise and smart in the exercise of that power we see the same thing in lebanon where we spend a good deal of america 's asset but because the leadership of this government do not pursue wise policy we have be humiliate and our opponent be strong

 the bottom line of national strength be that the president must be in command he must lead and when a president do not know that submarine missile be recallable say that 70 percent of our strategic force be conventional discover three year into his administration that our arm control effort have fail because he do not know that most soviet missile be on land these be thing a president must know to command

 a president be call the commander in chief and he be call that because he be suppose to be in charge of the fact and run our government and strengthen our nation

 ms geyer mr. mondale if i could broaden the question just a little bit since world war ii every conflict that we as americans have be involve with have be in nonconventional or irregular term and yet we keep fight in conventional or traditional military term

 the central american war be very much in the same pattern as china as lebanon as iran as cuba in their early day do you see any possibility that we be go to realize the change in warfare in our time or react to it in those term

 mr mondale we absolutely must which be why i respond to your first question the way i do it be much more complex you must understand the region you must understand the politic in the area you must provide a strong alternative and you must show strength and all at the same time

 that be why i object to the covert action in nicaragua that be a classic example of a strategy that be embarrassed we strengthen our opposition and undermine the moral authority of our people and our country in the region strength require knowledge command we have see in the nicaraguan example a policy that have actually hurt we strengthen our opposition and undermine the moral authority of our country in that region

 ms geyer mr. president in the last few month it have seem more and more that your policy in central america be begin to work yet just at this moment we be confront with the extraordinary story of a cia guerrilla manual for the anti sandinista contra whom we be back which advocate not only assassination of sandinistas but the hiring of criminal to assassinate the guerrilla we be support in order to create martyr be this not in effect our own state support terrorism

 president reagan no but i be glad you ask that question because i know it be on many people mind i have order an investigation i know that the cia be already go forward with one we have a gentleman down in nicaragua who be on contract to the cia advise supposedly on military tactic the contra and he draw up this manual it be turn over to the agency head of the cia in nicaragua to be print and a number of page be excise by that agency head there the man in charge and he send it on up here to cia where more page be excise before it be print but some way or other there be 12 of the original copy that get out down there and be not submit for this printing process by the cia

 now those be the detail as we have they and as soon as we have an investigation and find out where any blame lie for the few that do not get excise or change we certainly be go to do something about that we will take the proper action at the proper time

 i be very interested to hear about central america and our process down there and i think for a moment that instead of a debate i be go to find mr. mondale in complete agreement with what we be do because the plan that he have outline be the one we have be follow for quite some time include diplomatic process throughout central america and work closely with the contadora group

 so i can only tell you about the manual that we be not in the habit of assign guilt before there have be proper evidence produce and proof of that guilt but if guilt be establish whoever be guilty we will treat with that situation then and they will be remove

 ms geyer well mr. president you be imply then that the cia in nicaragua be direct the contra there i would also like to ask whether have the cia investigate its own manual in such a sensitive area be not sort of like send the fox into the chicken coop a second time

 president reagan i be afraid i misspoke when i say a cia head in nicaragua there be not someone there direct all of this activity there be as you know cia man station in other country in the world and certainly in central america and so it be a man down there in that area that this be deliver to and he recognize that what be in that manual be in direct contravention of my own executive order in december of 1981 that we would have nothing to do with regard to political assassination

 mr newman mr. mondale your rebuttal

 mr mondale what be a president charge with do when he take his oath of office he raise his right hand and take an oath of office to take care to faithfully execute the law of the land a president can not know everything but a president have to know those thing that be essential to his leadership and the enforcement of our law

 this manual several thousand of which be produce be distribute order political assassination hire of criminal and other form of terrorism some of it be excise but the part deal with political terrorism be continue how can this happen how can something this serious occur in an administration and have a president of the united states in a situation like this say he do not know a president must know these thing i do not know which be bad not know or know and not stop it

 and what about the mining of the harbor in nicaragua which violate international law this have hurt this country and a president 's suppose to command

 mr newman mr. president your rebuttal

 president reagan yes i have so many thing there to respond to i be go to pick out something you say early you have be all over the country repeat something that i will admit the press have also be repeat that i believe that nuclear missile could be fire and then call back i never ever conceive of such a thing i never say any such thing

 in a discussion of our strategic arm negotiation i say that submarine carry missile and airplane carry missile be more conventional type weapon not as destabilizing as the land base missile and that they be also weapon that or carrier that if they be send out and there be a change you could call they back before they have launch their missile

 but i hope that from here on you will no long be say that particular thing which be absolutely false how anyone could think that any sane person would believe you could call back a nuclear missile i think be as ridiculous as the whole concept have be so thank you for give i a chance to straighten the record i be sure that you appreciate that laughter

 mr newman mr. kalb your question to president reagan



 soviet union

 mr kalb mr. president you have often describe the soviet union as a powerful evil empire intent on world domination but this year you have say and i quote if they want to keep their mickey mouse system that be okay with i which be it mr. president do you want to contain they within their present border and perhaps try to reestablish detente or what go for detente or do you really want to roll back their empire

 president reagan i have say on a number of occasion exactly what i believe about the soviet union i retract nothing that i have say i believe that many of the thing they have do be evil in any concept of morality that we have but i also recognize that as the two great superpower in the world we have to live with each other and i tell mr. gromyko we do not like their system they do not like ours and we be not go to change their system and they sure well not try to change ours but between we we can either destroy the world or we can save it and i suggest that certainly it be to their common interest along with ours to avoid a conflict and to attempt to save the world and remove the nuclear weapon and i think that perhaps we establish a little well understanding

 i think that in deal with the soviet union one have to be realistic i know that mr. mondale in the past have make statement as if they be just people like ourselves and if we be kind and good and do something nice they would respond accordingly and the result be unilateral disarmament we cancel the b-1 under the previous administration what do we get for it nothing

 the soviet union have be engage in the big military buildup in the history of man at the same time that we try the policy of unilateral disarmament of weakness if you will and now we be put up a defense of our own and i have make it very plain to they we seek no superiority we simply be go to provide a deterrent so that it will be too costly for they if they be nurse any idea of aggression against we now they claim they be not and i make it plain to they we be not there be be no change in my attitude at all i just think when i come into office it be time that there be some realistic talk to and about the soviet union and we do get their attention



 region vital to u.s. interests

 mr kalb mr. president perhaps the other side of the coin a related question sir since world war ii the vital interest of the united states have always be define by treaty commitment and by presidential proclamation aside from what be obvious such as nato for example which country which region in the world do you regard as vital national interest of this country mean that you would send american troop to fight there if they be in danger

 president reagan ah well now you have add a hypothetical there at the end mr. kalb about where we would send troop in to fight i be not go to make the decision as to what the tactic could be but obviously there be a number of area in the world that be of importance to we one be the middle east and that be of interest to the whole western world and the industrialized nation because of the great supply of energy upon which so many depend there our neighbor here in america be vital to we we be work right now in try to be of help in southern africa with regard to the independence of namibia and the removal of the cuban surrogate the thousand of they from angola

 so i can say there be a great many interest i believe that we have a great interest in the pacific basin that be where i think the future of the world lie but i be not go to pick out one and in advance hypothetically say oh yes we would send troop there i do not want to send troop any place

 mr newman i be sorry mr. president sir your time be up

 president reagan all right



 soviet union

 mr kalb mr. mondale you have describe the soviet leader as and i be quote cynical ruthless and dangerous suggest an almost total lack of trust in they in that case what make you think that the annual summit meeting with they that you have propose will result in agreement that would satisfy the interest of this country

 mr mondale because the only type of agreement to reach with the soviet union be the type that be specifically define so we know exactly what they must do subject to full verification which mean we know every day whether they be live up to it and follow up wherever we find suggestion that they be violate it and the strong possible term

 i have no illusion about the soviet union leadership or the nature of that state they be a tough and a ruthless adversary and we must be prepare to meet that challenge and i would where i part with the president be that despite all of those difference we must as past president before this one have do meet on the common ground of survival and that be where the president have oppose practically every arm control agreement by every president of both political party since the bomb go off and he now complete this term with no progress toward arm control at all but with a very dangerous arm race underway instead there be now over 2,000 more warhead point at we today than there be when he be swear in and that do not strengthen we

 we must be very very realistic in the nature of that leadership but we must grind away and talk to find way of reduce these difference particularly where arm race be concerned and other dangerous exercise of soviet power

 there will be no unilateral disarmament under my administration i will keep this nation strong i understand exactly what the soviets be up to but that too be a part of national strength to do that a president must know what be essential to command and to leadership and to strength

 and that be where the president 's failure to master in my opinion the essential element of arm control have cost we dearly he be three year into this administration he say he just discover that most soviet missile be on land and that be why his proposal do not work

 i invite the american people tomorrow because i will issue the statement quote president reagan he say exactly what i say he say he say that these missile be less dangerous than ballistic missile because you could fire they and you could recall they if you decide there would be a miscalculation

 mr newman i be sorry sir

 mr mondale a president must know those thing



 eastern europe

 mr kalb a related question mr. mondale on eastern europe do you accept the conventional diplomatic wisdom that eastern europe be a soviet sphere of influence and if you do what could a mondale administration realistically do to help the people of eastern europe achieve the human right that be guarantee to they as a result of the helsinki accord

 mr mondale i think the essential strategy of the united states ought not accept any soviet control over eastern europe we ought to deal with each of these country separately we ought to pursue strategy with each of they economic and the rest that help they pull away from their dependence upon the soviet union

 where the soviet union have act irresponsibly as they have in many of those country especially recently in poland i believe we ought to insist that western credit extend to the soviet union bear the market rate make the soviets pay for their irresponsibility that be a very important objective to make certain that we continue to look forward to progress toward great independence by these nation and work with each of they separately

 mr newman mr. president your rebuttal

 president reagan yes i be not go to continue try to respond to these repetition of the falsehood that have already be state here but with regard to whether mr. mondale would be strong as he say he would be i know that he have a commercial out where he be appear on the deck of the nimitz and watch the f-14s take off and that be an image of strength except that if he have have his way when the nimitz be be plan he would have be deep in the water out there because there would not have be any nimitz to stand on he be against it laughter

 he be against the f-14 fighter he be against the m-1 tank he be against the bi bomber he want to cut the salary of all of the military he want to bring home half of the american force in europe and he have a record of weakness with regard to our national defense that be second to none

 audience member hear hear

 president reagan indeed he be on that side virtually throughout all his year in the senate and he oppose even president carter when toward the end of his term president carter want to increase the defense budget

 mr newman mr. mondale your rebuttal

 mr mondale mr. president i accept your commitment to peace but i want you to accept my commitment to a strong national defense applause i propose a budget i have propose a budget which would increase our nation 's strength in real term by double that of the soviet union

 i will tell you where we disagree it be true over 10 year ago i vote to delay production of the f-14 and i will tell you why the plane be not fly the way it be suppose to be it be a waste of money

 your definition of national strength be to throw money at the defense department my definition of national strength be to make certain that a dollar spend buy we a dollar 's worth of defense there be a big difference between the two of we a president must manage that budget i will keep we strong but you will not do that unless you command that budget and make certain we get the strength that we need you pay $ 500 for a $ 5 hammer you be not buy strength

 mr newman i would ask the audience not to applaud all it do be take up time that we would like to devote to the debate

 mr. kondracke your question to mr. mondale



 use of military force

 mr kondracke mr. mondale in an address early this year you say that before this country resort to military force and i be quote american interest should be sharply define publicly support congressionally sanction militarily feasible internationally defensible open to independent scrutiny and alert to regional history now be not you set up such a gauntlet of test here that adversary could easily suspect that as president you would never use force to protect american interest

 mr mondale no as a matter of fact i believe every one of those standard be essential to the exercise of power by this country and we can see that in both lebanon and in central america

 in lebanon this president exercise american power all right but the management of it be such that our marine be kill we have to leave in humiliation the soviet union become strong terrorist become emboldened and it be because they do not think through how power should be exercise do not have the american public with they on a plan that work that we end up the way we do

 similarly in central america what we be do in nicaragua with this covert war which the congress include many republicans have try to stop be finally end up with a public definition of american power that hurt we where we get associate with political assassin and the rest we have to decline for the first time in modern history jurisdiction in the world court because they will find we guilty of illegal action and our enemy be strengthen from all of this

 we need to be strong we need to be prepared to use that strength but we must understand that we be a democracy we be a government by the people and when we move it should be for very severe and extreme reason that serve our national interest and end up with a strong country behind we it be only in that way that we can persevere



 nicaragua

 mr kondracke you have be quote as say that you might quarantine nicaragua i would like to know what that mean would you stop soviet ship as president kennedy do in 1962 and would not that be more dangerous than president reagan 's covert war

 mr mondale what i be refer to there be the mutual self defense provision that exist in the inter american treaty the so call rio pact that permit the nation our friend in that region to combine to take step diplomatic and otherwise to prevent nicaragua when she act irresponsibly in assert power in other part outside of her border to take those step whatever they might be to stop it

 the nicaraguans must know that it be the policy of our government that that leadership must stay behind the boundary of their nation not interfere in other nation and by work with all of the nation in the region unlike the policy of this administration and unlike the president say they have not support negotiation in that region we will be much strong because we will have the moral authority that go with those effort



 lebanon

 mr kondracke president reagan you introduce u.s. force into lebanon as neutral peacekeeper but then you make they combatant on the side of the lebanese government eventually you be force to withdraw they under fire and now syria a soviet ally be dominant in the country do not lebanon represent a major failure on the part of your administration and raise serious question about your capacity as a foreign policy strategist and as commander in chief

 president reagan no morton i do not agree to all of those thing first of all when we and our ally the italians the french and the united kingdom go into lebanon we go in there at the request of what be leave of the lebanese government to be a stabilize force while they try to establish a government

 but the first pardon i the first time we go in we go in at their request because the war be go on right in beirut between israel and the plo terrorist israel could not be blame for that those terrorist have be violate their northern border consistently and israel chase they all the way to there

 then we go in with the multinational force to help remove and do remove more than 13,000 of those terrorist from lebanon we depart and then the government of lebanon ask we back in as a stabilize force while they establish a government and seek to get the foreign force all the way out of lebanon and that they could then take care of their own border

 and we be succeed we be there for the well part of a year our position happen to be at the airport oh there be occasional sniping and sometimes some artillery fire but we do not engage in conflict that be out of line with our mission i will never send troop anywhere on a mission of that kind without tell they that if somebody shoot at they they can darn well shoot back and this be what we do we never initiate any kind of action we defend ourselves there

 but we be succeed to the point that the lebanese government have be organize if you will remember there be the meeting in geneva in which they begin to meet with the hostile factional force and try to put together some kind of a peace plan we be succeed and that be why the terrorist act begin there be force there and that include syria in my mind who do not want we to succeed who do not want that kind of a peace with a dominant lebanon dominant over its own territory and so the terrorist act begin and lead to the one great tragedy when they be kill in that suicide bombing of the building then the multilateral force withdraw for only one reason we withdraw because we be no long able to carry out the mission for which we have be send in but we go in in the interest of peace and to keep israel and syria from get into the sixth war between they and i have no apology for our go on a peace mission

 mr kondracke mr. president four year ago you criticize president carter for ignore ample warning that our diplomat in iran might be take hostage have not you do exactly the same thing in lebanon not once but three time with 300 americans not hostage but dead and you vow swift retaliation against terrorist but do not our lack of response suggest that you be just bluff

 president reagan morton no i think there be a great difference between the government of iran threaten our diplomatic personnel and there be a government that you can see and can put your hand on in the terrorist situation there be terrorist faction all over in a recent 30 day period 37 terrorist act in 20 country have be commit the most recent have be the one in brighton in deal with terrorist yes we want to retaliate but only if we can put our finger on the people responsible and not endanger the life of innocent civilian there in the various community and in the city of beirut where these terrorist be operate

 i have just sign legislation to add to our ability to deal along with our ally with this terrorist problem and it be go to take all the nation together just as when we band together we pretty much resolve the whole problem of skyjacking sometime ago

 well the red light go on i could have go on forever

 mr newman mr. mondale your rebuttal

 mr mondale groucho marx say who do you believe?—me or your own eye and what we have in lebanon be something that the american people have see the joint chiefs urge the president not to put our troop in that barrack because they be indefensible they go to he five day before they be kill and say please take they out of there the secretary of state admit that this morning he do not do so the report follow the explosion of the barrack disclose that we have not take any of the step that we should have take that be the second time

 then the embassy be blow up a few week ago and once again none of the step that should have be take be take and we be warn five day before that explosive be on their way and they be not take the terrorist have win each time the president tell the terrorist he be go to retaliate he do not they call their bluff and the bottom line be that the united states leave in humiliation and our enemy be strong

 mr newman mr. president your rebuttal

 president reagan yes first of all mr. mondale should know that the president of the united states do not order the marine into that barrack that be a command decision make by the commander on the spot and base with what they think be good for the man there that be one

 on the other thing that you have just say about the terrorist i be tempt to ask you what you would do these be unidentified people and after the bomb go off they be blow to bit because they be suicidal individual who think they be go to go to paradise if they perpetrate such an act and lose their life in do it we be go to as i say we be busy try to find the center where these operation stem from and retaliation will be take but we be not go to simply kill some people to say oh look we get even we want to know when we retaliate that we be retaliate with those who be responsible for the terrorist act and terrorist act be such that our own united states capitol in washington have be bomb twice

 mr newman mr. trewhitt your question to president reagan



 the president 's age

 mr trewhitt mr. president i want to raise an issue that i think have be lurk out there for two or three week and cast it specifically in national security term you already be the old president in history and some of your staff say you be tired after your most recent encounter with mr. mondale i recall yet that president kennedy have to go for day on end with very little sleep during the cuban missile crisis be there any doubt in your mind that you would be able to function in such circumstance

 president reagan not at all mr. trewhitt and i want you to know that also i will not make age an issue of this campaign i be not go to exploit for political purpose my opponent 's youth and inexperience laughter and applause if i still have time i might add mr. trewhitt i might add that it be seneca or it be cicero i do not know which that say if it be not for the elder correct the mistake of the young there would be no state



 strategic missiles

 mr trewhitt mr. president i would like to head for the fence and try to catch that one before it go over but i will go on to another question

 you and mr. mondale have already disagree about what you have to say about recall submarine launch missile there be another a similar issue out there that relate to your it be say at least that you be unaware that the soviet retaliatory power be base on land base missile first be that correct secondly if it be correct have you inform yourself in the meantime and third be it even necessary for the president to be so intimately involve in strategic detail

 president reagan yes this have to do with our disarmament talk and the whole controversy about land missile come up because we think that the strategic nuclear weapon the most destabilizing be the land base you put your thumb on a button and somebody blow up 20 minute later so we think that it would be simple to negotiate first with those and then we make it plain a second phase take up the submarine launch or the airborne missile

 the soviet union to our surprise and not just mine make it plain when we bring this up that they place they think a great reliance on the landbased missile and therefore they want to take up all three and we agree we say all right if that be what you want to do but it be a surprise to we because they outnumber we 64 to 36 in submarine and 20 percent more bomber capable of carry nuclear missile than we have so why should we believe that they have place that much more reliance on landbase

 but even after we give in and say all right let us discuss it all they walk away from the table we do not



 the president 's age

 mr trewhitt mr. mondale i be go to hang in there should the president 's age and stamina be an issue in the political campaign

 mr mondale no and i have not make it an issue nor should it be what be at issue here be the president 's application of his authority to understand what a president must know to lead this nation secure our defense and make the decision and the judgment that be necessary

 a minute ago the president quote cicero i believe i want to quote somebody a little close to home harry truman he say the buck stop here we just hear the president 's answer for the problem at the barrack in lebanon where 241 marine be kill what happen first the joint chiefs of staff go to the president say do not put those troop there they do it and then five day before the troop be kill they go back to the president through the secretary of defense and say please mr. president take those troop out of there because we can not defend they they do not do it and we know what happen

 after that once again our embassy be explode this be the fourth time this have happen an identical attack in the same region despite warning even public warning from the terrorist who be in charge who be handle this matter that be my main point

 now on arm control we be complete four year this be the first administration since the bomb go off that make no progress we have an arm race underway instead

 a president have to lead his government or it will not be do different people with different view fight with each other for three and a half year this administration avoid arm control resist table arm control proposal that have any hope of agree rebuke their negotiator in 1981 when he come close to an agreement at least in principle on medium range weapon and we have this arm race underway and a recent book that just come out by perhaps the nation 's most respected author in this field strobe talbott call deadly gambits conclude that this president have fail to master the essential detail need to command and lead we both in term of security and term of arm control that be why they call the president the commander in chief

 good intention i grant but it take more than that you must be tough and smart



 the president 's leadership

 mr trewhitt this question of leadership keep arise in different form in this discussion already and the president mr. mondale have call you whine and vacillate among the more charitable phrase weak i believe it be a question of leadership and he have make the point that you have not repudiate some of the semidiplomatic activity of the reverend jackson particularly in central america do you approve of his diplomatic activity and be you prepared to repudiate he now

 mr mondale i read his statement the other day i do not admire fidel castro at all and i have say that che guevara be a contemptible figure in civilization 's history i know the cuban state as a police state and all my life i have work in a way that demonstrate that but jesse jackson be an independent person i do not control he

 and let us talk about people we do control in the last debate,1 the vice president of the united states say that i say the marines have die shamefully and die in shame in lebanon i demand an apology from vice president bush because i have instead honor these young man grieve for their family and think they be wonderful americans that honor we all what do the president have to say about take responsibility for a vice president who will not apologize for something like that

 mr. mondale be refer to an early debate between george bush and geraldine ferarro the vice presidential candidate

 mr newman mr. president your rebuttal

 president reagan yes i know it will come as a surprise to mr. mondale but i be in charge and as a matter of fact we have not avoid arm control talk with the soviet union very early in my administration i propose and i think something that have never be propose by any previous administration i propose a total elimination of intermediate range missile where the soviets have well than a 10 and still have well than a 10 to-1 advantage over the ally in europe when they protest that and suggest a small number perhaps i go along with that

 the so call negotiation that you say i walk out on be the so call walk in the wood between one of our representative and one of the soviet union and it be not i that turn it down the soviet union disavow it

 mr newman mr. mondale your rebuttal

 mr mondale there be two distinguished author on arm control in this country there be many other but two that i want to cite tonight one be strobe talbott in his classic book deadly gambits the other be john neuhaus who be one of the most distinguished arm control specialist in our country both say that this administration turn down the walk in the wood agreement first and that would have be a perfect agreement from the standpoint of the united states in europe and our security

 when mr. nitze a good negotiator return he be rebuke and his boss be fire this be the kind of leadership that we have have in this administration on the most deadly issue of our time now we have a runaway arm race all they have get to show for four year in u.s.-soviet relation be one meeting in the last week of an administration and nothing before

 they be tough negotiator but all previous president have make progress this one have not

 mr newman ms. geyer your question to mr. mondale



 illegal immigration

 ms geyer mr. mondale many analyst be now say that actually our number one foreign policy problem today be one that remain almost totally unrecognized massive illegal immigration from economically collapse country they be say that it be the only real territorial threat to the american nation state you yourself say in the 1970 that we have a hemorrhage on our border yet today you have back off any immigration reform such as the balanced and highly craft simpson mazzoli bill why what would you do instead today if anything

 mr mondale this be a very serious problem in our country and it have to be deal with i object to that part of the simpson mazzoli bill which i think be very unfair and would prove to be so that be the part that require employer to determine the citizenship of an employee before they be hire i be convinced that the result of this would be that people who be hispanic people who have different language or speak with an accent would find it difficult to be employ i think that be wrong we have never have citizenship test in our country before and i do not think we should have a citizenship card today that be counterproductive

 i do support the other aspect of the simpson mazzoli bill that strengthen enforcement at the border strengthen other way of deal with undocumented worker in this difficult area and deal with the problem of settle people who have live here for many many year and do not have an establish status

 i have far strongly recommend that this administration do something it have not do and that be to strengthen enforcement at the border strengthen the official in this government that deal with undocumented worker and to do so in a way that be responsible and within the constitution of the united states we need an answer to this problem but it must be an american answer that be consistent with justice and due process

 everyone in this room practically here tonight be an immigrant we come here love this nation serve it and it have serve all of our most bountiful dream and one of those dream be justice and we need a measure and i will support a measure that bring about those objective but avoid that one aspect that i think be very serious

 the second part be to maintain and improve relation with our friend to the south we can not solve this problem all on our own and that be why the failure of this administration to deal in an effective and a good faith way with mexico with costa rica with the other nation in try to find a peaceful settlement to the dispute in central america have undermine our capacity to effectively deal diplomatically in this area as well

 ms geyer sir people as well balanced and just as father theodore hesburgh at notre dame who head the select commission on immigration have point out repeatedly that there will be no immigration reform without employer sanction because it would be an unbalanced bill and there would be simply no way to enforce it however put that aside for the moment your critic have also say repeatedly that you have not go along with the bill or with any immigration reform because of the hispanic group or hispanic leadership group who actually do not represent what the hispanic americans want because poll show that they overwhelmingly want some kind of immigration reform can you say or how can you justify your position on this and how do you respond to the criticism that this be another or that this be an example of your flip flopping and give in to special interest group at the expense of the american nation

 mr mondale i think you be right that the poll show that the majority of hispanics want that bill so i be not do it for political reason i be do it because all my life i have fight for a system of justice in this country a system in which every american have a chance to achieve the fullness in life without discrimination this bill impose upon employer the responsibility of determine whether somebody who apply for a job be an american or not and just inevitably they be go to be reluctant to hire hispanics or people with a different accent

 if i be deal with politic here the poll show the american people want this i be for reform in this area for tough enforcement at the border and for many other aspect of the simpson mazzoli bill but all my life i have fight for a fair nation and despite the politic of it i stand where i stand and i think i be right and before this fight be over we be go to come up with a well bill a more effective bill that do not undermine the liberty of our people

 ms geyer mr. president you too have say that our border be out of control yet this fall you allow the simpson mazzoli bill which would at least have minimally protect our border and the right of citizenship because of a relatively unimportant issue of reimbursement to the state for legalized alien give that may i ask what priority can we expect you to give this forgotten national security element how sincere be you in your effort to control in effect the nation state that be the united states

 president reagan georgie anne we believe i support the simpson mazzoli bill strongly and the bill that come out of the senate however there be thing add in in the house side that we felt make it less of a good bill as a matter of fact make it a bad bill and in conference we stay with they in conference all the way to where even senator simpson do not want the bill in the manner in which it would come out of the conference committee there be a number of thing in there that weaken that bill i can not go into detail about they here

 but it be true our border be out of control it be also true that this have be a situation on our border back through a number of administration and i support this bill i believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down root and who have live here even though sometime back they may have enter illegally with regard to the employer sanction we must have that not only to ensure that we can identify the illegal alien but also while some keep protest about what it would do to employer there be another employer that we should not be so concerned about and these be employer down through the year who have encourage the illegal entry into this country because they then hire these individual and hire they at starvation wage and with none of the benefit that we think be normal and natural for worker in our country and the individual can not complain because of their illegal status we do not think that those people should be allow to continue operate free

 and this be why the provision that we have in with regard to sanction and so forth and i be go to do everything i can and all of we in the administration be to join in again when congress be back at it to get an immigration bill that will give we once again control of our border

 and with regard to friendship below the border and with the country down there yes no administration that i know have establish the relationship that we have with our latin friend but as long as they have an economy that leave so many people in dire poverty and unemployment they be go to seek that employment across our border and we work with those other country

 ms geyer mr. president the expert also say that the situation today be terribly different quantitatively qualitatively different from what it have be in the past because of the gigantic population growth for instance mexico 's population will go from about 60 million today to 120 million at the turn of the century many of these people will be come into the united states not as citizen but as illegal worker you have repeatedly say recently that you believe that armageddon the destruction of the world may be imminent in our time do you ever feel that we be in for an armageddon or a situation a time of anarchy regard the population explosion in the world

 president reagan no as a matter of fact the population explosion if you look at the actual figure have be vastly exaggerated over exaggerated as a matter of fact there be some pretty scientific and solid figure about how much space there still be in the world and how many more people we can have it be almost like go back to the malthusian theory when even then they be say that everyone would starve with the limited population they have then but the problem of population growth be one here with regard to our immigration and we have be the safety valve whether we want to or not with the illegal entry here in mexico where their population be increase and they do not have an economy that can absorb they and provide the job and this be what we be try to work out not only to protect our own border but to have some kind of fairness and recognition of that problem

 mr newman mr. mondale your rebuttal

 mr mondale one of the big problem today be that the country to our south be so desperately poor that these people who will almost lose their life if they do not come north come north despite all the risk and if we be go to find a permanent fundamental answer to this it go to american economic and trade policy that permit these nation to have a chance to get on their own two foot and to get prosperity so that they can have job for themselves and their people and that be why this enormous national debt engineer by this administration be harm these country in fuel this immigration these high interest rate real rate that have double under this administration have have the same effect on mexico and so on and the cost of repay those debt be so enormous that it result in massive unemployment hardship and heartache and that drive our friend to the south up into our region and we need to end those deficit as well

 mr newman mr. president your rebuttal

 president reagan well my rebuttal be i have hear the national debt blame for a lot of thing but not for illegal immigration across our border laughter and it have nothing to do with it

 but with regard to these high interest rate too at least give we the recognition of the fact that when you leave office mr. mondale they be 21 1/2 the prime rate it be now 12 1/4 and i predict it will be come down a little more shortly so we be try to undo some of the thing that your administration do applause

 mr newman no applause please

 mr. kalb your question to president reagan



 armageddon

 mr kalb mr. president i would like to pick up this armageddon theme you have be quote as say that you do believe deep down that we be head for some kind of biblical armageddon your pentagon and your secretary of defense have plan for the united states to fight and prevail in a nuclear war do you feel that we be now head perhaps for some kind of nuclear armageddon and do you feel that this country and the world could survive that kind of calamity

 president reagan mr. kalb i think what have be hail as something i be supposedly as president discuss as principle be the recall of just some philosophical discussion with people who be interested in the same thing and that be the prophecy down through the year the biblical prophecy of what would portend the coming of armageddon and so forth and the fact that a number of theologian for the last decade or more have believe that this be true that the prophecy be come together that portend that but no one know whether armageddon those prophecy mean that armageddon be a thousand year away or day after tomorrow so i have never seriously warn and say we must plan accord to armageddon

 now with regard to have to say whether we would try to survive in the event of a nuclear war of course we would but let i also point out that to several parliament around the world in europe and in asia i have make a statement to each one of they and i will repeat it here a nuclear war can not be win and must never be fight and that be why we be maintain a deterrent and try to achieve a deterrent capacity to where no one would believe that they could start such a war and escape with limited damage

 but the deterrent and that be what it be for be also what lead i to propose what be now be call the star wars concept but propose that we research to see if there be not a defensive weapon that could defend against incoming missile and if such a defense could be find would not it be far more humanitarian to say that now we can defend against a nuclear war by destroy missile instead of slaughter million of people



 strategic defense initiative

 mr kalb mr. president when you make that proposal the so call star wars proposal you say if i be not mistaken that you would share this very super sophisticated technology with the soviet union after all of the distrust over the year sir that you have express towards the soviet union do you really expect anyone to take seriously that offer that you would share the good of america 's technology in this weapon area with our principal adversary

 president reagan why not what if we do and i hope we can we be still research what if we come up with a weapon that render those missile obsolete there have never be a weapon invent in the history of man that have not lead to a defensive a counter weapon but suppose we come up with that

 now some people have say ah that would make war imminent because they would think that we could launch a first strike because we could defend against the enemy but why not do what i have offer to do and ask the soviet union to do say look here be what we can do we will even give it to you now will you sit down with we and once and for all get rid all of we of these nuclear weapon and free mankind from that threat i think that would be the great use of a defensive weapon

 mr kalb mr. mondale you have be very sharply critical of the president 's strategic defense initiative and yet what be wrong with a major effort by this country to try to use its good technology to knock out as many incoming nuclear warhead as possible

 mr mondale first of all let i sharply disagree with the president on share the most advanced the most dangerous the most important technology in america with the soviet union we have have for many year understandably a system of restraint on high technology because the soviets be behind we and any research or development along the star wars scheme would inevitably involve our most advanced computer our most advanced engineering and the thought that we would share this with the soviet union be in my opinion a total non starter i would not let the soviet union get their hand on it at all

 now what be wrong with star wars there be nothing wrong with the theory of it if we could develop a principle that would say both side could fire all their missile and no one would get hurt i suppose it be a good idea but the fact of it be we be so far away from research that even come close to that that the director of engineering research at the defense department say to get there we would have to solve eight problem each of which be more difficult than the atomic bomb and the manhattan project it would cost something like a trillion dollar to test and deploy weapon

 the second thing be this all assume that the soviets would not respond in kind and they always do we do not get behind they will not get behind and that be be the tragic story of the arm race we have more at stake in space satellite than they do if we could stop right now the testing and the deployment of these space weapon and the president 's proposal go clear beyond research if it be just research we would not have any argument because maybe someday somebody will think of something but to commit this nation to a buildup of antisatellite and space weapon at this time in their crude state would bring about an arm race that be very dangerous indeed

 one final point the most dangerous aspect of this proposal be for the first time we would delegate to computer the decision as to whether to start a war that be dead wrong there would not be time for a president to decide it would be decide by these remote computer it might be an oil fire it might be a jet exhaust the computer might decide it be a missile and off we go

 why do not we stop this madness now and draw a line and keep the heaven free from war applause



 nuclear freeze

 mr kalb mr. mondale in this general area sir of arm control president carter 's national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski say a nuclear freeze be a hoax yet the basis of your arm proposal as i understand they be a mutual and verifiable freeze on exist weapon system in your view which specific weapon system could be subject to a mutual and verifiable freeze and which could not

 mr mondale every system that be verifiable should be place on the table for negotiation for an agreement i would not agree to any negotiation or any agreement that involve conduct on the part of the soviet union that we could not verify every day i would not agree to any agreement in which the united states security interest be not fully recognize and support that be why we say mutual and verifiable freeze

 now why do i support the freeze because this ever rise arm race madness make both nation less secure it be more difficult to defend this nation it be put a hair trigger on nuclear war this administration by go into the star wars system be go to add a dangerous new escalation we have to be tough on the soviet union but i think the american people

 mr newman your time be up mr. mondale

 mr mondale and the people of the soviet union want it to stop

 mr newman president reagan your rebuttal

 president reagan yes my rebuttal once again be that this invention that have just be create here of how i would go about roll over for the soviet union no mr. mondale my idea would be with that defensive weapon that we would sit down with they and then say now be you willing to join we here be what we"—give they a demonstration and then say—"here be what we can do now if you be willing to join we in getting rid of all the nuclear weapon in the world then we will give you this one so that we would both know that no one can cheat that we be both get something that if anyone try to cheat

 but when you keep star warring it i never suggest where the weapon should be or what kind i be not a scientist i say and the joint chiefs of staff agree with i that it be time for we to turn our research ability to see if we could not find this kind of defensive weapon and suddenly somebody say oh it be get to be up there and it be star wars and so forth i do not know what it would be but if we can come up with one i think the world will be well off

 mr newman mr. mondale your rebuttal

 mr mondale well that be what a president 's suppose to know where those weapon be go to be if they be space weapon i assume they will be in space laughter if they be antisatellite weapon i assume they be go to be aim against satellite

 now this be the most dangerous technology that we possess the soviets try to spy on we steal this stuff and to give they technology of this kind i disagree with you have not just accept research mr. president you have set up a strategic defense initiative an agency you be begin to test you be talk about deploy you be ask for a budget of some $ 30 billion for this purpose this be an arm escalation and we will be well off far well off if we stop right now because we have more to lose in space then they do if someday somebody come along with an answer that be something else but that there would be an answer in our lifetime be unimaginable

 why do we start thing that we know the soviets will match and make we all less secure that be what a president 's for

 mr newman mr. kondracke your question to mr. mondale



 strategic weapons

 mr kondracke mr. mondale you say that with respect to the soviet union you want to negotiate a mutual nuclear freeze yet you would unilaterally give up the mx missile and the b-1 bomber before the talk have even begin and you have announce in advance that reach an agreement with the soviets be the most important thing in the world to you now be not you give away half the store before you even sit down to talk

 mr mondale no as a matter of fact we have a vast range of technology and weaponry right now that provide all the bargaining chip that we need and i support the air launch cruise missile the ground launch cruise missile the pershing missile the trident submarine the d-5 submarine stealth technology the midgetman we have a whole range of technology why i disagree with the mx be that it be a sit duck it will draw an attack it put a hair trigger and it be a dangerous destabilizing weapon and the b-1 be similarly to be oppose because for 15 year the soviet union have be prepare to meet the b-1 the secretary of defense himself say it would be a suicide mission if it be build

 instead i want to build the midgetman which be mobile and thus less vulnerable contribute to stability and a weapon that will give we security and contribute to an incentive for arm control that be why i be for stealth technology to build a stealth bomber which i have support for year that can penetrate the soviet air defense system without any hope that they can perceive where it be because their radar system be frustrate in other word a president have to make choice this make we strong

 the final point be that we can use this money that we save on these weapon to spend on thing that we really need our conventional strength in europe be under strength we need to strengthen that in order to assure our western ally of our presence there a strong defense but also to diminish and reduce the likelihood of a commencement of a war and the use of nuclear weapon it be in this way by make wise choice that we be strong we enhance the chance of arm control every president until this one have be able to do it and this nation or the world be more dangerous as a result



 nuclear freeze

 mr kondracke i want to follow up on mr. kalb 's question it seem to i on the question of verifiability that you do have some problem with the extent of the freeze it seem to i for example that testing would be very difficult to verify because the soviets encode their telemetry research would be impossible to verify number of warhead would be impossible to verify by satellite except for with on site inspection and production of any weapon would be impossible to verify now in view of that what be go to be freeze

 mr mondale i will not agree to any arm control agreement include a freeze that be not verifiable let us take your warhead principle the warhead principle there have be count rule for year whenever a weapon be test we count the number of warhead on it and whenever that warhead be use we count that number of warhead whether they have that number or less on it or not these be standard rule i will not agree to any production restriction or agreement unless we have the ability to verify those agreement i do not trust the russians i believe that every agreement we reach must be verifiable and i will not agree to anything that we can not tell every day in other word we have get to be tough but in order to stop this arm madness we have get to push ahead with tough negotiation that be verifiable so that we know the soviets be agree and live up to their agreement



 support for u.s. allies

 mr kondracke mr. president i want to ask you a question about negotiate with friend you severely criticize president carter for help to undermine two friendly dictator who get into trouble with their own people the shah of iran and president somoza of nicaragua now there be other such leader head for trouble include president pinochet of chile and president marcos of the philippines what should you do and what can you do to prevent the philippines from become another nicaragua

 president pinochet morton i do criticize the president because of our undercutting of what be a stalwart ally the shah of iran and i be not at all convince that he be that far out of line with his people or that they want that to happen the shah have do our bidding and carry our load in the middle east for quite some time and i do think that it be a blot on our record that we let he down have thing get well the shah whatever he might have do be build low cost housing have take land away from the mullahs and be distribute it to the peasant so they could be landowner thing of that kind but we turn it over to a maniacal fanatic who have slaughter thousand and thousand of people call it execution

 the matter of somoza no i never defend somoza and as a matter of fact the previous administration stand by and so do i not that i could have do anything in my position at that time but for this revolution to take place and the promise of the revolution be democracy human right free labor union free press and then just as castro have do in cuba the sandinistas oust the other party to the revolution many of they be now the contra they exile some they jail some they murder some and they instal a marxist leninist totalitarian government

 and what i have to say about this be many time and this have to do with the philippines also i know there be thing there in the philippines that do not look good to we from the standpoint right now of democratic right but what be the alternative it be a large communist movement to take over the philippines they have be our friend since their inception as a nation

 and i think that we have have enough of a record of let under the guise of revolution someone that we think be a little more right than we would be let that person go and then wind up with totalitarianism pure and simple as the alternative and i think that we be well off for example with the philippines of try to retain our friendship and help they right the wrong we see rather than throw they to the wolf and then face a communist power in the pacific

 mr kondracke mr. president since the united states have two strategically important basis in the philippines would the overthrow of president marcos constitute a threat to vital american interest and if so what would you do about it

 president reagan well as i say we have to look at what an overthrow there would mean and what the government would be that would follow and there be every evidence every indication that that government would be hostile to the united states and that would be a severe blow to our ability there in the pacific

 mr kondracke and what would you do about it

 mr newman sorry i be sorry you have ask the followup question

 mr. mondale your rebuttal

 mr mondale perhaps in no area do we disagree more than this administration 's policy on human right

 i go to the philippines as vice president press for human right call for the release of aquino and make progress that have be stall on both the subic and the clark airfield basis what explain this administration cozye up to the argentine dictator after they take over fortunately a democracy take over but this nation be embarrassed by this current administration 's adoption of their policy

 what happen in south africa where for example the nobel prize winner two day ago say this administration be see as work with the oppressive government of south africa that hurt this nation we need to stand for human right we need to make it clear we be for human liberty national security and human right must go together but this administration time and time again have lose its way in this field

 mr newman president reagan your rebuttal

 president reagan well the invasion of afghanistan do not take place on our watch i have describe what have happen in iran and we be not here then either i do not think that our record of human right can be assail i think that we have observe ourselves and have do our good to see that human right be extend throughout the world

 mr. mondale have recently announce a plan of his to get the democracy together and to work with the whole world to turn to democracy and i be glad to hear he say that because that be what we have be do ever since i announce to the british parliament that i think we should do this

 human right be not advanced when at the same time you then stand back and say whoops we do not know the gun be load and you have another totalitarian power on your hand

 mr newman in this segment because of the pressure of time there will be no rebuttal and there will be no followup question mr. trewhitt your question to president reagan

 mr trewhitt one question to each candidate

 mr newman one question to each candidate



 nuclear weapons

 mr trewhitt mr. president could i take you back to something you say early and if i be misquote you please correct i but i understand you to say that if the development of space military technology be successful you might give the soviets a demonstration and say here it be which sound to i as if you might be try to gain the sort of advantage that would enable you to dictate term and which i will then suggest to you might mean scrap a generation of nuclear strategy call mutual deterrence in which we in effect hold each other hostage be that your intention

 president reagan well i can not say that i have roundtable that and sit down with the chiefs of staff but i have say that it seem to i that this could be a logical step in what be my ultimate goal my ultimate dream and that be the elimination of nuclear weapon in the world and it seem to i that this could be an adjunct or certainly a great assist agent in get that do i be not go to roll over as mr. mondale suggest and give they something that could turn around and be use against we but i think it be a very interesting proposal to see if we can find first of all something that render those weapon obsolete incapable of their mission

 but mr. mondale seem to approve mad mad be mutual assure destruction meaning if you use nuclear weapon on we the only thing we have to keep you from do it be that we will kill as many people of your as you will kill of ours

 i think that to do everything we can to find as i say something that would destroy weapon and not human be a great step forward in human right

 mr trewhitt mr. mondale could i ask you to address the question of nuclear strategy then the formal doctrine be very arcane but i be go to ask you to deal with it anyway do you believe in mad mutual assure destruction mutual deterrence as it have be practice for the last generation

 mr mondale i believe in a sensible arm control approach that bring down these weapon to manageable level i would like to see their elimination and in the meantime we have to be strong enough to make certain that the soviet union never tempt us

 now here we have to decide between generalized objective and reality the president say he want to eliminate or reduce the number of nuclear weapon but in fact these last four year have see more weapon build a wide and more vigorous arm race than in human history he say he want a system that will make nuclear war safe so nobody be go to get hurt well maybe someday somebody can dream of that

 but why start an arm race now why destabilize our relationship why threaten our space satellite upon which we depend why pursue a strategy that would delegate to computer the question of start a war

 a president to defend this country and to get arm control must master what be go on i accept his objective and his dream we all do but the hard reality be that we must know what we be do and pursue those objective that be possible in our time he be oppose every effort of every president to do so and in the four year of his administration he be fail to do so and if you want a tough president who use that strength to get arm control and draw the line in the heaven vote for walter mondale applause

 mr newman please i must again ask the audience not to applaud not to cheer not to demonstrate its feeling in any way

 we have arrive at the point in the debate now where we call for closing statement you have the full four minute each of you mr. mondale will you go first



 closing statements

 mr mondale i want to thank the league of women voters the good citizen of kansas city and president reagan for agree to debate this evening

 this evening we talk about national strength i believe we need to be strong and i will keep we strong but i think strength must also require wisdom and smart in its exercise that be key to the strength of our nation

 a president must know the essential fact essential to command but a president must also have a vision of where this nation should go tonight as americans you have a choice and you be entitle to know where we would take this country if you decide to elect we

 as president i would press for long term vigorous economic growth that be why i want to get these debt down and these interest rate down restore america 's export help rural america which be suffer so much and bring the job back here for our child

 i want this next generation to be the well educate in american history to invest in the human mind and science again so we be out front i want this nation to protect its air its water its land and its public health america be not temporary we be forever and as americans our generation should protect this wonderful land for our child

 i want a nation of fairness where no one be deny the fullness of life or discriminate against and we deal compassionately with those in our midst who be in trouble

 and above all i want a nation that be strong since we debate two week ago the united states and the soviet union have build a hundred more warhead enough to kill million of americans and million of soviet citizen this do not strengthen we this weaken the chance of civilization to survive

 i remember the night before i become vice president i be give the briefing and tell that any time night or day i might be call upon to make the most fateful decision on earth whether to fire these atomic weapon that could destroy the human specie that lesson tell we two thing one pick a president that you know will know if that tragic moment ever come what he must know because there will be no time for staff committee or adviser a president must know right then but above all pick a president who will fight to avoid the day when that god awful decision ever need to be make

 and that be why this election be so terribly important america and americans decide not just what be happen in this country we be the strong and most powerful free society on earth when you make that judgment you be decide not only the future of our nation in a very profound respect you be decide the future of the world

 we need to move on it be time for america to find new leadership please join i in this cause to move confidently and with a sense of assurance and command to build the blessed future of our nation

 mr newman president reagan your summation please

 president reagan yes my thank to the league of women voters to the panelist the moderator and to the people of kansas city for their warm hospitality and greeting

 i think the american people tonight have much to be grateful for an economic recovery that have become expansion freedom and most of all we be at peace

 i be grateful for the chance to reaffirm my commitment to reduce nuclear weapon and one day to eliminate they entirely

 the question before you come down to this do you want to see america return to the policy of weakness of the last four year or do we want to go forward march together as a nation of strength and that be go to continue to be strong

 we should not be dwell on the past or even the present the meaning of this election be the future and whether we be go to grow and provide the job and the opportunity for all americans and that they need

 several year ago i be give an assignment to write a letter it be to go into a time capsule and would be read in 100 year when that time capsule be open i remember drive down the california coast one day my mind be full of what i be go to put in that letter about the problem and the issue that confront we in our time and what we do about they but i could not completely neglect the beauty around i the pacific out there on one side of the highway shine in the sunlight the mountain of the coast range rise on the other side and i find myself wonder what it would be like for someone wonder if someone 100 year from now would be drive down that highway and if they would see the same thing and with that thought i realize what a job i have with that letter

 i would be write a letter to people who know everything there be to know about we we know nothing about they they would know all about our problem they would know how we solve they and whether our solution be beneficial to they down through the year or whether it hurt they they would also know that we live in a world with terrible weapon nuclear weapon of terrible destructive power aim at each other capable of cross the ocean in a matter of minute and destroy civilization as we know it and then i think to myself what be they go to say about we what be those people 100 year from now go to think they will know whether we use those weapon or not

 well what they will say about we 100 year from now depend on how we keep our rendezvous with destiny will we do the thing that we know must be do and know that one day down in history 100 year or perhaps before someone will say thank god for those people back in the 1980 for preserve our freedom for save for we this bless planet call earth with all its grandeur and its beauty

 you know i be grateful to all of you for give i the opportunity to serve you for these four year and i seek reelection because i want more than anything else to try to complete the new beginning that we chart four year ago george bush who i think be one of the fine vice presidents this country have ever have george bush and i have crisscross the country and we have have in these last few month a wonderful experience we have meet young america we have meet your son and daughter

 mr newman mr. president i be oblige to cut you off there under the rule of the debate i be sorry

 president reagan all right i be just go to

 mr newman perhaps i should point out that the rule under which i do that be agree upon by the two campaign

 president reagan i know

 mr newman with the league as you know sir

 president reagan i know yes

 mr newman thank you mr. president thank you mr. mondale our thank also to the panel finally to our audience we thank you and the league of women voters ask i to say to you do not forget to vote on november 6

senator mathias chief justice burger vice president bush speaker o'neill senator dole reverend clergy and member of my family and friend and my fellow citizen
 this day have be make bright with the presence here of one who for a time have be absent senator john stennis god bless you and welcome back
 there be however one who be not with we today representative gillis long of louisiana leave we last night and i wonder if we could all join in a moment of silent prayer
 the president resume speak after a moment of silence
 amen
 there be no word adequate to express my thank for the great honor that you have bestow on i i will do my utmost to be deserve of your trust
 this be as senator mathias tell we the 50th time that we the people have celebrate this historic occasion when the first president george washington place his hand upon the bible he stand less than a single day 's journey by horseback from raw untamed wilderness there be 4 million americans in a union of 13 state today we be 60 time as many in a union of 50 states we have light the world with our invention go to the aid of mankind wherever in the world there be a cry for help journey to the moon and safely return so much have change and yet we stand together as we do two century ago
 when i take this oath 4 year ago i do so in a time of economic stress voice be raise say that we have to look to our past for the greatness and glory but we the present day americans be not give to look backward in this blessed land there be always a well tomorrow
 four year ago i speak to you of a new beginning and we have accomplish that but in another sense our new beginning be a continuation of that beginning create two century ago when for the first time in history government the people say be not our master it be our servant its only power that which we the people allow it to have
 that system have never fail we but for a time we fail the system we ask thing of government that government be not equip to give we yield authority to the national government that properly belong to states or to local government or to the people themselves we allow taxis and inflation to rob we of our earning and saving and watch the great industrial machine that have make we the most productive people on earth slow down and the number of unemployed increase
 by 1980 we know it be time to renew our faith to strive with all our strength toward the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with an orderly society
 we believe then and now there be no limit to growth and human progress when man and woman be free to follow their dream and we be right to believe that tax rate have be reduce inflation cut dramatically and more people be employ than ever before in our history
 we be create a nation once again vibrant robust and alive but there be many mountain yet to climb we will not rest until every american enjoy the fullness of freedom dignity and opportunity as our birthright it be our birthright as citizen of this great republic
 and if we meet this challenge these will be year when americans have restore their confidence and tradition of progress when our value of faith family work and neighborhood be restate for a modern age when our economy be finally free from government 's grip when we make sincere effort at meaningful arm reduction and by rebuild our defense our economy and develop new technology helped preserve peace in a troubled world when america courageously support the struggle for individual liberty self government and free enterprise throughout the world and turn the tide of history away from totalitarian darkness and into the warm sunlight of human freedom
 my fellow citizen our nation be poise for greatness we must do what we know be right and do it with all our might let history say of we these be golden year when the american revolution be reborn when freedom gain new life and america reach for her good
 our two party system have solve we serve we i should say well over the year but never well than in those time of great challenge when we come together not as democrats or republicans but as americans unite in a common cause
 two of our founding fathers a boston lawyer name adams and a virginia planter name jefferson member of that remarkable group who meet in independence hall and dare to think they could start the world over again leave we an important lesson they have become in the year then in government bitter political rival in the presidential election of 1800 then year later when both be retire and age have soften their anger they begin to speak to each other again through letter a bond be reestablish between those two who have help create this government of our
 in 1826 the 50th anniversary of the declaration of independence they both die they die on the same day within a few hour of each other and that day be the fourth of july
 in one of those letter exchange in the sunset of their life jefferson write it carry i back to the time when beset with difficulty and danger we be fellow laborer in the same cause struggle for what be most valuable to man his right of self government labor always at the same oar with some wave ever ahead threaten to overwhelm we and yet pass harmless we ride through the storm with heart and hand
 well with heart and hand let we stand as one today one people under god determine that our future shall be worthy of our past as we do we must not repeat the well intentione error of our past we must never again abuse the trust of work man and woman by send their earning on a futile chase after the spiral demand of a bloated federal establishment you elect we in 1980 to end this prescription for disaster and i do not believe you reelect we in 1984 to reverse course
 at the heart of our effort be one idea vindicate by 25 straight month of economic growth freedom and incentive unleash the drive and entrepreneurial genius that be the core of human progress we have begin to increase the reward for work saving and investment reduce the increase in the cost and size of government and its interference in people 's life
 we must simplify our tax system make it more fair and bring the rate down for all who work and earn we must think anew and move with a new boldness so every american who seek work can find work so the least among we shall have an equal chance to achieve the great thing to be hero who heal our sick feed the hungry protect peace among nation and leave this world a well place
 the time have come for a new american emancipation a great national drive to tear down economic barrier and liberate the spirit of enterprise in the most distressed area of our country my friend together we can do this and do it we must so help i god
 from new freedom will spring new opportunity for growth a more productive fulfil and united people and a strong america an america that will lead the technological revolution and also open its mind and heart and soul to the treasure of literature music and poetry and the value of faith courage and love
 a dynamic economy with more citizen work and pay taxis will be our strong tool to bring down budget deficit but an almost unbroken 50 year of deficit spending have finally bring we to a time of reckoning we have come to a turning point a moment for hard decision i have ask the cabinet and my staff a question and now i put the same question to all of you if not we who and if not now when it must be do by all of we go forward with a program aim at reach a balanced budget we can then begin reduce the national debt
 i will shortly submit a budget to the congress aim at freeze government program spending for the next year beyond this we must take further step to permanently control government 's power to tax and spend we must act now to protect future generation from government 's desire to spend its citizen money and tax they into servitude when the bill come due let we make it unconstitutional for the federal government to spend more than the federal government take in
 we have already start return to the people and to state and local government responsibility well handle by they now there be a place for the federal government in matter of social compassion but our fundamental goal must be to reduce dependency and upgrade the dignity of those who be infirm or disadvantaged and here a grow economy and support from family and community offer our good chance for a society where compassion be a way of life where the old and infirm be care for the young and yes the unborn protect and the unfortunate look after and make self sufficient
 now there be another area where the federal government can play a part as an old american i remember a time when people of different race creed or ethnic origin in our land find hatred and prejudice instal in social custom and yes in law there be no story more heartening in our history than the progress that we have make toward the brotherhood of man that god intend for we let we resolve there will be no turning back or hesitation on the road to an america rich in dignity and abundant with opportunity for all our citizen
 let we resolve that we the people will build an american opportunity society in which all of we white and black rich and poor young and old will go forward together arm in arm again let we remember that though our heritage be one of blood line from every corner of the earth we be all americans pledge to carry on this last good hope of man on earth
 i have speak of our domestic goal and the limitation we should put on our national government now let i turn to a task that be the primary responsibility of national government the safety and security of our people
 today we utter no prayer more fervently than the ancient prayer for peace on earth yet history have show that peace do not come nor will our freedom be preserve by good will alone there be those in the world who scorn our vision of human dignity and freedom one nation the soviet union have conduct the great military buildup in the history of man build arsenal of awesome offensive weapon
 we have make progress in restore our defense capability but much remain to be do there must be no wavering by we nor any doubt by other that america will meet her responsibility to remain free secure and at peace
 there be only one way safely and legitimately to reduce the cost of national security and that be to reduce the need for it and this we be try to do in negotiation with the soviet union we be not just discuss limit on a further increase of nuclear weapon we seek instead to reduce their number we seek the total elimination one day of nuclear weapon from the face of the earth
 now for decade we and the soviets have live under the threat of mutual assure destruction if either resort to the use of nuclear weapon the other could retaliate and destroy the one who have start it be there either logic or morality in believe that if one side threaten to kill ten of million of our people our only recourse be to threaten kill ten of million of theirs
 i have approve a research program to find if we can a security shield that will destroy nuclear missile before they reach their target it would not kill people it would destroy weapon it would not militarize space it would help demilitarize the arsenal of earth it would render nuclear weapon obsolete we will meet with the soviets hope that we can agree on a way to rid the world of the threat of nuclear destruction
 we strive for peace and security hearten by the change all around we since the turn of the century the number of democracy in the world have grow fourfold human freedom be on the march and nowhere more so than in our own hemisphere freedom be one of the deep and noblest aspiration of the human spirit people worldwide hunger for the right of self determination for those inalienable right that make for human dignity and progress
 america must remain freedom 's staunch friend for freedom be our good ally and it be the world 's only hope to conquer poverty and preserve peace every blow we inflict against poverty will be a blow against its dark ally of oppression and war every victory for human freedom will be a victory for world peace
 so we go forward today a nation still mighty in its youth and powerful in its purpose with our alliance strengthen with our economy lead the world to a new age of economic expansion we look to a future rich in possibility and all of this be because we work and act together not as member of political party but as americans
 my friend we live in a world that be light by lightning so much be change and will change but so much endure and transcend time
 history be a ribbon always unfurling history be a journey and as we continue our journey we think of those who travel before we we stand again at the step of this symbol of our democracy well we would have be stand at the step if it have not get so cold laughter now we be stand inside this symbol of our democracy and we see and hear again the echo of our past a general fall to his knee in the hard snow of valley forge a lonely president pace the darken hall and ponder his struggle to preserve the union the man of the alamo call out encouragement to each other a settler push west and sing a song and the song echo out forever and fill the unknowe air
 it be the american sound it be hopeful big hearted idealistic daring decent and fair that be our heritage that be our song we sing it still for all our problem our difference we be together as of old we raise our voice to the god who be the author of this most tender music and may he continue to hold we close as we fill the world with our sound in unity affection and love one people under god dedicate to the dream of freedom that he have place in the human heart call upon now to pass that dream on to a waiting and hopeful world
 god bless you and god bless america

 in the late 1950 's worker at the at&amp;t semiconductor plant in pennsylvania produce five transistor a day for $ 7.50 apiece they now produce over a million for less than a penny apiece

 new laser technique could revolutionize heart bypass surgery cut diagnosis time for virus link to cancer from week to minute reduce hospital cost dramatically and hold out new promise for save human life

 our automobile industry have overhaul assembly line increase worker productivity and be competitive once again

 we stand on the threshold of a great ability to produce more do more be more our economy be not get old and weak it be get young and strong it do not need rest and supervision it need new challenge great freedom and that word freedom be the key to the second american revolution that we need to bring about

 let we move together with an historic reform of tax simplification for fairness and growth last year i ask treasury secretary then regan to develop a plan to simplify the tax code so all taxpayer would be treat more fairly and personal tax rate could come far down

 we have cut tax rate by almost 25 percent yet the tax system remain unfair and limit our potential for growth exclusion and exemption cause similar income to be tax at different level low income family face steep tax barrier that make hard life even hard the treasury department have produce an excellent reform plan whose principle will guide the final proposal that we will ask you to enact

 one thing that tax reform will not be be a tax increase in disguise we will not jeopardize the mortgage interest deduction that family need we will reduce personal tax rate as low as possible by remove many tax preference we will propose a top rate of no more than 35 percent and possibly low and we will propose reduce corporate rate while maintain incentive for capital formation

 to encourage opportunity and job rather than dependency and welfare we will propose that individual live at or near the poverty line be totally exempt from federal income tax to restore fairness to family we will propose increase significantly the personal exemption

 and tonight i be instruct treasury secretary james baker i have to get use to say that to begin work with congressional author and committee for bipartisan legislation conform to these principle we will call upon the american people for support and upon every man and woman in this chamber together we can pass this year a tax bill for fairness simplicity and growth make this economy the engine of our dream and america the investment capital of the world so let we begin

 tax simplification will be a giant step toward unleash the tremendous pen up power of our economy but a second american revolution must carry the promise of opportunity for all it be time to liberate the spirit of enterprise in the most distressed area of our country

 this government will meet its responsibility to help those in need but policy that increase dependency break up family and destroy self respect be not progressive they be reactionary despite our stride in civil right black hispanics and all minority will not have full and equal power until they have full economic power

 we have repeatedly seek passage of enterprise zone to help those in the abandon corner of our land find job learn skill and build well life this legislation be support by a majority of you

 mr. speaker i know we agree that there must be no forgotten americans let we place new dream in a million heart and create a new generation of entrepreneur by pass enterprise zone this year and tip you could make that a birthday present

 nor must we lose the chance to pass our youth employment opportunity wage proposal we can help teenager who have the high unemployment rate find summer job so they can know the pride of work and have confidence in their future

 we will continue to support the job training partnership act which have a nearly two third job placement rate credit in education and health care voucher will help work family shop for service that they need

 our administration be already encourage certain low income public housing resident to own and manage their own dwelling it be time that all public housing resident have that opportunity of ownership

 the federal government can help create a new atmosphere of freedom but states and locality many of which enjoy surplus from the recovery must not permit their tax and regulatory policy to stand as barrier to growth

 let we resolve that we will stop spread dependency and start spread opportunity that we will stop spread bondage and start spread freedom

 there be some who say that growth initiative must await final action on deficit reduction well the good way to reduce deficit be through economic growth more business will be start more investment make more job create and more people will be on payroll pay taxis the good way to reduce government spending be to reduce the need for spending by increase prosperity each add percentage point per year of real gnp growth will lead to cumulative reduction in deficit of nearly $ 200 billion over 5 year

 to move steadily toward a balanced budget we must also lighten government 's claim on our total economy we will not do this by raise taxis we must make sure that our economy grow fast than the growth in spending by the federal government in our fiscal year 1986 budget overall government program spending will be freeze at the current level it must not be one dime high than fiscal year 1985 and three point be key

 first the social safety net for the elderly the needy the disabled and unemployed will be leave intact growth of our major health care program medicare and medicaid will be slow but protection for the elderly and needy will be preserve

 second we must not relax our effort to restore military strength just as we near our goal of a fully equip train and ready professional corps national security be government 's first responsibility so in past year defense spending take about half the federal budget today it take less than a third we have already reduce our plan defense expenditure by nearly a hundred billion dollar over the past 4 year and reduce project spending again this year

 you know we only have a military industrial complex until a time of danger and then it become the arsenal of democracy spending for defense be invest in thing that be priceless peace and freedom

 third we must reduce or eliminate costly government subsidy for example deregulation of the airline industry have lead to cheap airfare but on amtrak taxpayer pay about $ 35 per passenger every time an amtrak train leave the station it be time we end this huge federal subsidy

 our farm program cost have quadruple in recent year yet i know from visit farmer many in great financial distress that we need an orderly transition to a market orient farm economy we can help farmer good not by expand federal payment but by make fundamental reform keep interest rate head down and knock down foreign trade barrier to american farm export

 we be move ahead with grace commission reform to eliminate waste and improve government 's management practice in the long run we must protect the taxpayer from government and i ask again that you pass as 32 states have now call for an amendment mandate the federal government spend no more than it take in and i ask for the authority use responsibly by 43 governor to veto individual item in appropriation bill senator mattingly have introduce a bill permit a 2 year trial run of the line item veto i hope you will pass and send that legislation to my desk

 nearly 50 year of government live beyond its mean have bring we to a time of reckoning our be but a moment in history but one moment of courage idealism and bipartisan unity can change american history forever

 sound monetary policy be key to long run economic strength and stability we will continue to cooperate with the federal reserve board seek a steady policy that ensure price stability without keep interest rate artificially high or needlessly hold down growth

 reduce unneeded red tape and regulation and deregulate the energy transportation and financial industry have unleash new competition give consumer more choice well service and low price in just one set of grant program we have reduce 905 page of regulation to 31 we seek to fully deregulate natural gas to bring on new supply and bring we close to energy independence consistent with safety standard we will continue remove restraint on the bus and railroad industry we will soon end up legislation or send up legislation i should say to return conrail to the private sector where it belong and we will support further deregulation of the trucking industry

 every dollar the federal government do not take from we every decision it do not make for we will make our economy strong our life more abundant our future more free

 our second american revolution will push on to new possibility not only on earth but in the next frontier of space despite budget restraint we will seek record funding for research and development

 we have see the success of the space shuttle now we be go to develop a permanently manned space station and new opportunity for free enterprise because in the next decade americans and our friend around the world will be live and work together in space

 in the zero gravity of space we could manufacture in 30 day lifesave medicine it would take 30 year to make on earth we can make crystal of exceptional purity to produce super computer create job technology and medical breakthrough beyond anything we ever dream possible

 as we do all this we will continue to protect our natural resource we will seek reauthorization and expand funding for the superfund program to continue clean up hazardous waste site which threaten human health and the environment

 now there be another great heritage to speak of this evening of all the change that have sweep america the past 4 year none bring great promise than our rediscovery of the value of faith freedom family work and neighborhood

 we see sign of renewal in increase attendance in place of worship renew optimism and faith in our future love of country rediscover by our young who be lead the way we have rediscover that work be good in and of itself that it ennoble we to create and contribute no matter how seemingly humble our job we have see a powerful new current from an old and honorable tradition american generosity

 from thousand answer peace corps appeal to help boost food production in africa to million volunteering time corporation adopt school and community pull together to help the neediest among we at home we have refound our value private sector initiative be crucial to our future

 i thank the congress for pass equal access legislation give religious group the same right to use classroom after school that other group enjoy but no citizen need tremble nor the world shudder if a child stand in a classroom and breathe a prayer we ask you again give child back a right they have for a century and a half or more in this country

 the question of abortion grip our nation abortion be either the taking of a human life or it be not and if it be and medical technology be increasingly show it be it must be stop it be a terrible irony that while some turn to abortion so many other who can not become parent cry out for child to adopt we have room for these child we can fill the cradle of those who want a child to love and tonight i ask you in the congress to move this year on legislation to protect the unborn

 in the area of education we be return to excellence and again the hero be our people not government we be stress basic of discipline rigorous testing and homework while help child become computer smart as well for 20 year scholastic aptitude test score of our high school student go down but now they have go up 2 of the last 3 year we must go forward in our commitment to the new basic give parent great authority and make sure good teacher be reward for hard work and achievement through merit pay

 of all the change in the past 20 year none have more threaten our sense of national well being than the explosion of violent crime one do not have to be attack to be a victim the woman who must run to her car after shop at night be a victim the couple drape their door with lock and chain be victim as be the tired decent clean woman who can not ride a subway home without be afraid

 we do not seek to violate the right of defendant but should not we feel more compassion for the victim of crime than for those who commit crime for the first time in 20 year the crime index have fall 2 year in a row we have convict over 7,400 drug offender and put they as well as leader of organized crime behind bar in record number

 but we must do more i urge the house to follow the senate and enact proposal permit use of all reliable evidence that police officer acquire in good faith these proposal would also reform the habeas corpus law and allow in keep with the will of the overwhelming majority of americans the use of the death penalty where necessary

 there can be no economic revival in ghetto when the most violent among we be allow to roam free it be time we restore domestic tranquility and we mean to do just that

 just as we be position as never before to secure justice in our economy we be poise as never before to create a safe free more peaceful world our alliance be strong than ever our economy be strong than ever we have resume our historic role as a leader of the free world and all of these together be a great force for peace

 since 1981 we have be commit to seek fair and verifiable arm agreement that would lower the risk of war and reduce the size of nuclear arsenal now our determination to maintain a strong defense have influence the soviet union to return to the bargaining table our negotiator must be able to go to that table with the united support of the american people all of we have no great dream than to see the day when nuclear weapon be ban from this earth forever

 each member of the congress have a role to play in modernize our defense thus support our chance for a meaningful arm agreement your vote this spring on the peacekeeper missile will be a critical test of our resolve to maintain the strength we need and move toward mutual and verifiable arm reduction

 for the past 20 year we have believe that no war will be launch as long as each side know it can retaliate with a deadly counterstrike well i believe there be a well way of eliminate the threat of nuclear war it be a strategic defense initiative aim ultimately at find a nonnuclear defense against ballistic missile it be the most hopeful possibility of the nuclear age but it be not very well understand

 some say it will bring war to the heaven but its purpose be to deter war in the heaven and on earth now some say the research would be expensive perhaps but it could save million of life indeed humanity itself and some say if we build such a system the soviets will build a defense system of their own well they already have strategic defense that surpass our a civil defense system where we have almost none and a research program cover roughly the same area of technology that we be now explore and finally some say the research will take a long time well the answer to that be let us get start

 harry truman once say that ultimately our security and the world 's hope for peace and human progress lie not in measure of defense or in the control of weapon but in the growth and expansion of freedom and self government

 and tonight we declare anew to our fellow citizen of the world freedom be not the sole prerogative of a choose few it be the universal right of all god 's child look to where peace and prosperity flourish today it be in home that freedom build victory against poverty be great and peace most secure where people live by law that ensure free press free speech and freedom to worship vote and create wealth

 our mission be to nourish and defend freedom and democracy and to communicate these ideal everywhere we can america 's economic success be freedom 's success it can be repeat a hundred time in a hundred different nation many country in east asia and the pacific have few resource other than the enterprise of their own people but through low tax rate and free market they have soar ahead of centralized economy and now china be open up its economy to meet its need

 we need a strong and simple approach to the process of make and implement trade policy and we will be study potential change in that process in the next few week we have see the benefit of free trade and live through the disaster of protectionism tonight i ask all our trading partner develop and develop alike to join we in a new round of trade negotiation to expand trade and competition and strengthen the global economy and to begin it in this next year

 there be more than 3 billion human being live in third world country with an average per capita income of $ 650 a year many be victim of dictatorship that impoverish they with taxation and corruption let we ask our ally to join we in a practical program of trade and assistance that foster economic development through personal incentive to help these people climb from poverty on their own

 we can not play innocent abroad in a world that be not innocent nor can we be passive when freedom be under siege without resource diplomacy can not succeed our security assistance program help friendly government defend themselves and give they confidence to work for peace and i hope that you in the congress will understand that dollar for dollar security assistance contribute as much to global security as our own defense budget

 we must stand by all our democratic ally and we must not break faith with those who be risk their life on every continent from afghanistan to nicaragua to defy soviet support aggression and secure right which have be our from birth

 the sandinista dictatorship of nicaragua with full cuban soviet bloc support not only persecute its people the church and deny a free press but arm and provide basis for communist terrorist attack neighboring state support for freedom fighter be self defense and totally consistent with the oas and u.n. charters it be essential that the congress continue all facet of our assistance to central america i want to work with you to support the democratic force whose struggle be tie to our own security

 and tonight i have speak of great plan and great dream they be dream we can make come true two hundred year of american history should have teach we that nothing be impossible

 ten year ago a young girl leave vietnam with her family part of the exodus that follow the fall of saigon they come to the united states with no possession and not know a word of english ten year ago the young girl study hard learn english and finish high school in the top of her class and this may may 22d to be exact be a big date on her calendar just 10 year from the time she leave vietnam she will graduate from the united states military academy at west point i think you might like to meet an american hero name jean nguyen

 now there be someone else here tonight bear 79 year ago she live in the inner city where she care for infant bear of mother who be heroin addict the child bear in withdrawal be sometimes even drop on her doorstep she help they with love go to her house some night and maybe you will see her silhouette against the window as she walk the floor talk softly soothe a child in her arm mother hale of harlem and she too be an american hero

 jean mother hale your life tell we that the old american saying be new again anything be possible in america if we have the faith the will and the heart history be ask we once again to be a force for good in the world let we begin in unity with justice and love

 thank you and god bless you

chancellor kohl and honor guest this painful walk into the past have do much more than remind we of the war that consume the european continent what we have see make unforgettably clear that no one of the rest of we can fully understand the enormity of the feeling carry by the victim of these camp the survivor carry a memory beyond anything that we can comprehend the awful evil start by one man an evil that victimize all the world with its destruction be uniquely destructive of the million force into the grim abyss of these camp
 here lie people jews whose death be inflict for no reason other than their very existence their pain be bear only because of who they be and because of the god in their prayer alongside they lie many christians catholics and protestants
 for year after year until that man and his evil be destroy hell yawn forth its awful content people be bring here for no other purpose but to suffer and die to go unfed when hungry uncared for when sick torture when the whim strike and leave to have misery consume they when all there be around they be misery
 i be sure we all share similar first thought and that be what of the youngster who die at this dark stalag all be go for they forever not to feel again the warmth of life 's sunshine and promise not the laughter and the splendid ache of grow up nor the consoling embrace of a family try to think of be young and never have a day without sear emotional and physical pain desolate unrelieved pain
 today we have be grimly remind why the commandant of this camp be name the beast of belsen above all we be strike by the horror of it all the monstrous incomprehensible horror and that be what we have see but be what we can never understand as the victim do nor with all our compassion can we feel what the survivor feel to this day and what they will feel as long as they live what we have feel and be express with word can not convey the suffering that they endure that be why history will forever brand what happen as the holocaust
 here death rule but we have learn something as well because of what happen we find that death can not rule forever and that be why we be here today we be here because humanity refuse to accept that freedom of the spirit of man can ever be extinguish we be here to commemorate that life triumph over the tragedy and the death of the holocaust overcome the suffering the sickness the testing and yes the gassing we be here today to confirm that the horror can not outlast hope and that even from the bad of all thing the good may come forth therefore even out of this overwhelming sadness there must be some purpose and there be it come to we through the transform love of god
 we learn from the talmud that it be only through suffer that the child of israel obtain three priceless and coveted gift the torah the land of israel and the world to come yes out of this sickness as crush and cruel as it be there be hope for the world as well as for the world to come out of the ashe hope and from all the pain promise
 so much of this be symbolize today by the fact that most of the leadership of free germany be represent here today chancellor kohl you and your countryman have make real the renewal that have to happen your nation and the german people have be strong and resolute in your willingness to confront and condemn the act of a hate regime of the past this reflect the courage of your people and their devotion to freedom and justice since the war think how far we have come from that time when despair make these tragic victim wonder if anything could survive
 as we fly here from hanover low over the green farm and the emerge springtime of the lovely german countryside i reflect and there must have be a time when the prisoner at bergen belsen and those of every other camp must have feel the springtime be go forever from their life surely we can understand that when we see what be around we all these child of god under bleak and lifeless mound the plainness of which do not even hint at the unspeakable act that create they here they lie never to hope never to pray never to love never to heal never to laugh never to cry
 and too many of they know that this be their fate but that be not the end through it all be their faith and a spirit that move their faith
 nothing illustrate this well than the story of a young girl who die here at bergen belsen for more than 2 year anne frank and her family have hide from the nazis in a confine annex in holland where she keep a remarkably profound diary betray by an informant anne and her family be send by freight car first to auschwitz and finally here to bergen belsen
 just 3 week before her capture young anne write these word it be really a wonder that i have not drop all my ideal because they seem so absurd and impossible to carry out yet i keep they because in spite of everything i still believe that people be good at heart i simply can not build up my hope on a foundation consist of confusion misery and death i see the world gradually be turn into a wilderness i hear the ever approach thunder which will destroy we too i can feel the suffering of million and yet if i look up into the heaven i think that it will all come right that this cruelty too will end and that peace and tranquility will return again eight
 month later this sparkle young life end here at bergen belsen somewhere here lie anne frank
 everywhere here be memory pull we touch we make we understand that they can never be erase such memory take we where god intend his child to go toward learning toward healing and above all toward redemption they beckon we through the endless stretch of our heart to the knowing commitment that the life of each individual can change the world and make it well
 we be all witness we share the glistening hope that rest in every human soul hope lead we if we be prepared to trust it toward what our president lincoln call the well angel of our nature and then rise above all this cruelty out of this tragic and nightmarish time beyond the anguish the pain and the suffering for all time we can and must pledge never again

mr. speaker mr. president members of the congress distinguished guest and my fellow americans
 it be great to be home and nancy and i thank you for this wonderful homecoming and before i go on i want to say a personal thank you to nancy she be an outstanding ambassador of good will for all of we she do not know i be go to say that mr. speaker senator dole i want you to know that your statement of support here be greatly appreciate you can not imagine how much it mean in deal with the soviets to have the congress the ally and the american people firmly behind you
 i guess you know that i have just come from geneva and talk with general secretary gorbachev in the past few day the past 2 day we spend over 15 hour in various meeting with the general secretary and the member of his official party and approximately 5 of those hour be talk between mr. gorbachev and myself just one on one that be the good part our fireside summit there will be i know a great deal of commentary and opinion as to what the meeting produce and what they be like there be over 3,000 reporter in geneva so it be possible there will be 3,000 opinion on what happen so maybe it be the old broadcaster in i but i decide to file my own report directly to you
 we meet as we have to meet i call for a fresh start and we make that start i can not claim that we have a meeting of the mind on such fundamental as ideology or national purpose but we understand each other well and that be a key to peace i gain a well perspective i feel he do too it be a constructive meeting so constructive in fact that i look forward to welcome mr. gorbachev to the united states next year and i have accept his invitation to go to moscow the follow year we arrange that out in the parking lot i find mr. gorbachev to be an energetic defender of soviet policy he be an eloquent speaker and a good listener
 our subject matter be shape by the fact of this century these past 40 year have not be an easy time for the west or for the world you know the fact there be no need to recite the historical record suffice it to say that the united states can not afford illusion about the nature of the u.s.s.r. we can not assume that their ideology and purpose will change this imply endure competition our task be to assure that this competition remain peaceful with all that divide we we can not afford to let confusion complicate thing far we must be clear with each other and direct we must pay each other the tribute of candor
 when i take the oath of office for the first time we begin deal with the soviet union in a way that be more realistic than in say the recent past and so in a very real sense preparation for the summit start not month ago but 5 year ago when with the help of congress we begin strengthen our economy restore our national will and rebuild our defense and alliance america be once again strong and our strength have give we the ability to speak with confidence and see that no true opportunity to advance freedom and peace be lose we must not now abandon policy that work i need your continued support to keep america strong
 that be the history behind the geneva summit and that be the context in which it occur and may i add that we be especially eager that our meeting give a push to important talk already underway on reduce nuclear weapon on this subject it would be foolish not to go the extra mile or in this case the extra 4,000 mile we discuss the great issue of our time i make clear before the first meeting that no question would be sweep aside no issue bury just because either side find it uncomfortable or inconvenient i bring these question to the summit and put they before mr. gorbachev
 we discuss nuclear arm and how to reduce they i explain our proposal for equitable verifiable and deep reduction i outline my conviction that our proposal would make not just for a world that feel safe but one that really be safe i be pleased to report tonight that general secretary gorbachev and i do make a measure of progress here we have a long way to go but we be still head in the right direction we move arm control forward from where we be last january when the soviets return to the table we be both instruct our negotiator to hasten their vital work the world be wait for result
 specifically we agree in geneva that each side should move to cut offensive nuclear arm by 50 percent in appropriate category in our joint statement we call for early progress on this turn the talk toward our chief goal offensive reduction we call for an interim accord on intermediate range nuclear force lead i hope to the complete elimination of this class of missile and all of this with tough verification we also make progress in combat together the spread of nuclear weapon an arm control area in which we have cooperate effectively over the year
 we be also open a dialog on combat the spread and use of chemical weapon while move to ban they altogether other arm control dialog in vienna on conventional force and in stockholm on lessen the chance for surprise attack in europe also receive a boost and finally we agree to begin work on risk reduction center a decision that should give special satisfaction to senators nunn and warner who so ably promote this idea
 i describe our strategic defense initiative our research effort that envision the possibility of defensive system which could ultimately protect all nation against the danger of nuclear war this discussion produce a very direct exchange of view mr. gorbachev insist that we might use a strategic defense system to put offensive weapon into space and establish nuclear superiority i make it clear that sdi have nothing to do with offensive weapon that instead we be investigate nonnuclear defense system that would only threaten offensive missile not people if our research succeed it will bring much close the safe more stable world that we seek nation could defend themselves against missile attack and mankind at long last escape the prison of mutual terror and this be my dream
 so i welcome the chance to tell mr. gorbachev that we be a nation that defend rather than attack that our alliance be defensive not offensive we do not seek nuclear superiority we do not seek a first strike advantage over the soviet union indeed one of my fundamental arm control objective be to get rid of first strike weapon altogether this be why we have propose a 50 percent reduction in the most threatening nuclear weapon especially those that could carry out a first strike
 i go far in express our peaceful intention i describe our proposal in the geneva negotiation for a reciprocal program of open laboratory in strategic defense research we be offer to permit soviet expert to see firsthand that sdi do not involve offensive weapon american scientist would be allow to visit comparable facility of the soviet strategic defense program which in fact have involve much more than research for many year finally i reassure mr. gorbachev on another point i promise that if our research reveal that a defense against nuclear missile be possible we would sit down with our ally and the soviet union to see how together we could replace all strategic ballistic missile with such a defense which threaten no one
 we discuss threat to the peace in several region of the world i explain my proposal for a peace process to stop the war in afghanistan nicaragua ethiopia angola and cambodia those place where insurgency that speak for the people be pit against regime which obviously do not represent the will or the approval of the people i try to be very clear about where our sympathy lie i believe i succeed we discuss human right we americans believe that history teach no clear lesson than this those country which respect the right of their own people tend inevitably to respect the right of their neighbor human right therefore be not an abstract moral issue it be a peace issue finally we discuss the barrier to communication between our society and i elaborate on my proposal for real people to people contact on a wide scale americans should know the people of the soviet union their hope and fear and the fact of their life and citizen of the soviet union need to know of america 's deep desire for peace and our unwavering attachment to freedom
 as you can see our talk be wide range and let i at this point tell you what we agree upon and what we do not we remain far apart on a number of issue as have to be expect however we reach agreement on a number of matter and as i mention we agree to continue meeting and this be important and very good there be always room for movement action and progress when people be talk to each other instead of about each other
 we have conclude a new agreement design to bring the good of america 's artist and academic to the soviet union the exhibit that will be include in this exchange be one of the most effective way for the average soviet citizen to learn about our way of life this agreement will also expand the opportunity for americans to experience the soviet people 's rich cultural heritage because their artist and academic will be come here we have also decide to go forward with a number of people to people initiative that will go beyond great contact not only between the political leader of our two country but our respective student teacher and other as well we have emphasize youth exchange and this will help break down stereotype build friendship and frankly provide an alternative to propaganda
 we have agree to establish a new soviet consulate in new york and a new american consulate in kiev and this will bring a permanent u.s. presence to the ukraine for the first time in decade and we have also together with the government of japan conclude a pacific air safety agreement with the soviet union this be design to set up cooperative measure to improve civil air safety in that region of the pacific what happen before must never to be allow to happen there again and as a potential way of deal with the energy need of the world of the future we have also advocate international cooperation to explore the feasibility of develop fusion energy
 all of these step be part of a long term effort to build a more stable relationship with the soviet union no one ever say it could be easy but we have come a long way as for soviet expansionism in a number of region of the world while there be little chance of immediate change we will continue to support the heroic effort of those who fight for freedom but we have also agree to continue and to intensify our meeting with the soviets on this and other regional conflict and to work toward political solution
 we know the limit as well as the promise of summit meeting this be after all the 11th summit of the postwar era and still the difference endure but we believe continue meeting between the leader of the united states and the soviet union can help bridge those difference the fact be every new day begin with possibility it be up to we to fill it with the thing that move we toward progress and peace hope therefore be a realistic attitude and despair an uninteresting little vice
 and so be our journey worthwhile well 30 year ago when ike president eisenhower have just return from a summit in geneva he say the wide gulf that separate so far east and west be wide and deep well today three decade later that be still true but yes this meeting be worthwhile for both side a new realism spawn the summit the summit itself be a good start and now our byword must be steady as we go i be as you be impatient for result but good will and good hope do not always yield last result and quick fix do not fix big problem just as we must avoid illusion on our side so we must dispel they on the soviet side i have make it clear to mr. gorbachev that we must reduce the mistrust and suspicion between we if we be to do such thing as reduce arm and this will take deed not word alone and i believe he be in agreement
 where do we go from here well our desire for improved relation be strong we be ready and eager for step by step progress we know that peace be not just the absence of war we do not want a phony peace or a frail peace we do not go in pursuit of some kind of illusory detente we can not be satisfied with cosmetic improvement that will not stand the test of time we want real peace
 as i fly back this evening i have many thought in just a few day family across america will gather to celebrate thanksgiving and again as our forefather who voyage to america we travel to geneva with peace as our goal and freedom as our guide for there can be no greater good than the quest for peace and no fine purpose than the preservation of freedom it be 350 year since the first thanksgiving when pilgrims and indians huddle together on the edge of an unknown continent and now here we be gather together on the edge of an unknown future but like our forefather really not so much afraid but full of hope and trust in god as ever
 thank you for allow i to talk to you this evening and god bless you all

lady and gentleman i would plan to speak to you tonight to report on the state of the union but the event of early today have lead i to change those plan today be a day for mourning and remembering nancy and i be pain to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle challenger we know we share this pain with all of the people of our country this be truly a national loss

 mr. speaker before i begin my prepared remark may i point out that tonight mark the 10th and last state of the union message that you have preside over and on behalf of the american people i want to salute you for your service to congress and country here be to you applause

 i have come to review with you the progress of our nation to speak of unfinished work and to set our sight on the future i be pleased to report the state of our union be strong than a year ago and grow strong each day tonight we look out on a rise america firm of heart unite in spirit powerful in pride and patriotism america be on the move but it be not long ago that we look out on a different land lock factory gate long gasoline line intolerable price and interest rate turn the great country on earth into a land of broken dream government grow beyond our consent have become a lumber giant slamming shut the gate of opportunity threaten to crush the very root of our freedom what bring america back the american people bring we back with quiet courage and common sense with undying faith that in this nation under god the future will be ours for the future belong to the free

 tonight the american people deserve our thank for 37 straight month of economic growth for sunrise firm and modernized industry create 9 million new job in 3 year interest rate cut in half inflation fall over from 12 percent in 1980 to under 4 today and a mighty river of good work a record $ 74 billion in voluntary giving just last year alone and despite the pressure of our modern world family and community remain the moral core of our society guardian of our value and hope for the future family and community be the costar of this great american comeback they be why we say tonight private value must be at the heart of public policy

 what be true for family in america be true for america in the family of free nation history be no captive of some inevitable force history be make by man and woman of vision and courage tonight freedom be on the march the united states be the economic miracle the model to which the world once again turn we stand for an idea whose time be now only by lift the weight from the shoulder of all can people truly prosper and can peace among all nation be secure teddy roosevelt say that a nation that do great work live forever we have do well but we can not stop at the foothill when everest beckon it be time for america to be all that we can be

 we speak tonight of an agenda for the future an agenda for a safe more secure world and we speak about the necessity for action to steel we for the challenge of growth trade and security in the next decade and the year 2000 and we will do it not by break faith with bedrock principle but by break free from fail policy let we begin where storm cloud loom dark right here in washington dc this week i will send you our detailed proposal tonight let we speak of our responsibility to redefine government 's role not to control not to demand or command not to contain we but to help in time of need and above all to create a ladder of opportunity to full employment so that all americans can climb toward economic power and justice on their own

 but we can not win the race to the future shackle to a system that can not even pass a federal budget we can not win that race hold back by horse and buggy program that waste tax dollar and squander human potential we can not win that race if we be swamp in a sea of red ink now mr. speaker you know i know and the american people know the federal budget system be break it do not work before we leave this city let us you and i work together to fix it and then we can finally give the american people a balanced budget

 members of congress passage of gramm rudman hollings give we an historic opportunity to achieve what have elude our national leadership for decade force the federal government to live within its mean your schedule now require that the budget resolution be pass by april 15th the very day america 's family have to foot the bill for the budget that you produce how often we read of a husband and wife both work struggle from paycheck to paycheck to raise a family meet a mortgage pay their taxis and bill and yet some in congress say taxis must be raise well i be sorry they be ask the wrong people to tighten their belt it be time we reduce the federal budget and leave the family budget alone we do not face large deficit because american family be undertaxed we face those deficit because the federal government overspend

 the detailed budget that we will submit will meet the gramm rudman hollings target for deficit reduction meet our commitment to ensure a strong national defense meet our commitment to protect social security and the truly less fortunate and yes meet our commitment to not raise taxis how should we accomplish this well not by take from those in need as family take care of their own government must provide shelter and nourishment for those who can not provide for themselves but we must revise or replace program enact in the name of compassion that degrade the moral worth of work encourage family breakup and drive entire community into a bleak and heartless dependency gramm rudman hollings can mark a dramatic improvement but experience show that simply set deficit target do not assure they will be meet we must proceed with grace commission reform against waste

 and tonight i ask you to give i what 43 governor have give i a line item veto this year give i the authority to veto waste and i will take the responsibility i will make the cut i will take the heat this authority would not give i any monopoly power but simply prevent spending measure from sneak through that could not pass on their own merit and you can sustain or override my veto that be the way the system should work once we have make the hard choice we should lock in our gain with a balanced budget amendment to the constitution

 i mention that we will meet our commitment to national defense we must meet it defense be not just another budget expense keep america strong free and at peace be solely the responsibility of the federal government it be government 's prime responsibility we have devote 5 year try to narrow a dangerous gap bear of illusion and neglect and we have make important gain yet the threat from soviet force conventional and strategic from the soviet drive for domination from the increase in espionage and state terror remain great this be reality close our eye will not make reality disappear we pledge together to hold real growth in defense spending to the bare minimum my budget honor that pledge and i be now ask you the congress to keep its end of the bargain the soviets must know that if america reduce her defense it will be because of a reduce threat not a reduce resolve

 keep america strong be as vital to the national security as control federal spending be to our economic security but as i have say before the most powerful force we can enlist against the federal deficit be an ever expand american economy unfettered and free the magic of opportunity unreserve unfailing unrestraine isn't this the calling that unite we i believe our tax rate cut for the people have do more to spur a spirit of risk taking and help america 's economy break free than any program since john kennedy 's tax cut almost a quarter century ago

 now history call we to press on to complete effort for an historic tax reform provide new opportunity for all and ensure that all pay their fair share but no more we have come this far will you join i now and we will walk this last mile together you know my view on this we can not and we will not accept tax reform that be a tax increase in disguise true reform must be an engine of productivity and growth and that mean a top personal rate no high than 35 percent true reform must be truly fair and that mean raise personal exemption to $ 2,000 true reform mean a tax system that at long last be profamily projob profuture and pro america

 as we knock down the barrier to growth we must redouble our effort for free and fairer trade we have already take action to counter unfair trading practice and to pry open close foreign market we will continue to do so we will also oppose legislation tout as provide protection that in reality pit one american worker against another one industry against another one community against another and that raise price for we all if the united states can trade with other nation on a level playing field we can outproduce outcompete and outsell anybody anywhere in the world

 the constant expansion of our economy and export require a sound and stable dollar at home and reliable exchange rate around the world we must never again permit wild currency swing to cripple our farmer and other exporter farmer in particular have suffer from past unwise government policy they must not be abandon with problem they do not create and can not control we have begin coordinate economic and monetary policy among our major trading partner but there be more to do and tonight i be direct treasury secretary jim baker to determine if the nation of the world should convene to discuss the role and relationship of our currency

 confident in our future and secure in our value americans be strive forward to embrace the future we see it not only in our recovery but in 3 straight year of fall crime rate as family and community band together to fight pornography drug and lawlessness and to give back to their child the safe and yes innocent childhood they deserve we see it in the renaissance in education the rise sat score for three year last year 's increase the great since 1963 it be not government and washington lobby that turn education around it be the american people who in reach for excellence know to reach back to basic we must continue the advance by support discipline in our school voucher that give parent freedom of choice and we must give back to our child their lose right to acknowledge god in their classroom

 we be a nation of idealist yet today there be a wound in our national conscience america will never be whole as long as the right to life grant by our creator be deny to the unborn for the rest of my time i shall do what i can to see that this wound be one day heal

 as we work to make the american dream real for all we must also look to the condition of america 's family struggle parent today worry how they will provide their child the advantage that their parent give they in the welfare culture the breakdown of the family the most basic support system have reach crisis proportion female and child poverty child abandonment horrible crime and deteriorate school after hundred of billion of dollar in poverty program the plight of the poor grow more painful but the waste in dollar and cent pale before the most tragic loss the sinful waste of human spirit and potential we can ignore this terrible truth no long as franklin roosevelt warn 51 year ago stand before this chamber he say welfare be a narcotic a subtle destroyer of the human spirit and we must now escape the spider 's web of dependency

 tonight i be charge the white house domestic council to present i by december 1 1986 an evaluation of program and a strategy for immediate action to meet the financial educational social and safety concern of poor family i be talk about real and lasting emancipation because the success of welfare should be judge by how many of its recipient become independent of welfare far after see how devastating illness can destroy the financial security of the family i be direct the secretary of health and human services dr. otis bowen to report to i by year end with recommendation on how the private sector and government can work together to address the problem of affordable insurance for those whose life saving would otherwise be threaten when catastrophic illness strike

 and tonight i want to speak directly to america 's young generation because you hold the destiny of our nation in your hand with all the temptation young people face it sometimes seem the allure of the permissive society require superhuman feat of self control but the call of the future be too strong the challenge too great to get lose in the blind alleyway of dissolution drug and despair never have there be a more exciting time to be alive a time of rouse wonder and heroic achievement as they say in the film back to the future where we be go we do not need road

 well today physicist peer into the infinitely small realm of subatomic particle find reaffirmation of religious faith astronomer build a space telescope that can see to the edge of the universe and possibly back to the moment of creation so yes this nation remain fully committed to america 's space program we be go forward with our shuttle flight we be go forward to build our space station and we be go forward with research on a new orient express that could by the end of the next decade take off from dulles airport accelerate up to 25 time the speed of sound attain low earth orbit or fly to tokyo within 2 hour and the same technology transform our life can solve the great problem of the 20th century a security shield can one day render nuclear weapon obsolete and free mankind from the prison of nuclear terror america meet one historic challenge and go to the moon now america must meet another to make our strategic defense real for all the citizen of planet earth

 let we speak of our deep longing for the future to leave our child a land that be free and just and a world at peace it be my hope that our fireside summit in geneva and mr. gorbachev 's upcoming visit to america can lead to a more stable relationship surely no people on earth hate war or love peace more than we americans but we can not stroll into the future with childlike faith our difference with a system that openly proclaim and practice an allege right to command people 's life and to export its ideology by force be deep and abide logic and history compel we to accept that our relationship be guide by realism rock hard cleareyed steady and sure our negotiator in geneva have propose a radical cut in offensive force by each side with no cheating they have make clear that soviet compliance with the letter and spirit of agreement be essential if the soviet government want an agreement that truly reduce nuclear arm there will be such an agreement

 but arm control be no substitute for peace we know that peace follow in freedom 's path and conflict erupt when the will of the people be deny so we must prepare for peace not only by reduce weapon but by bolster prosperity liberty and democracy however and wherever we can we advance the promise of opportunity every time we speak out on behalf of low tax rate free market sound currency around the world we strengthen the family of freedom every time we work with ally and come to the aid of friend under siege and we can enlarge the family of free nation if we will defend the unalienable right of all god 's child to follow their dream

 to those imprison in regime hold captive to those beat for dare to fight for freedom and democracy for their right to worship to speak to live and to prosper in the family of free nation we say to you tonight you be not alone freedom fighter america will support with moral and material assistance your right not just to fight and die for freedom but to fight and win freedom to win freedom in afghanistan in angola in cambodia and in nicaragua this be a great moral challenge for the entire free world

 surely no issue be more important for peace in our own hemisphere for the security of our frontier for the protection of our vital interest than to achieve democracy in nicaragua and to protect nicaragua 's democratic neighbor this year i will be ask congress for the mean to do what must be do for that great and good cause as former senator henry m. scoop jackson the inspiration for our bipartisan commission on central america once say in matter of national security the good politic be no politic

 what we accomplish this year in each challenge we face will set our course for the balance of the decade indeed for the remainder of the century after all we have do so far let no one say that this nation can not reach the destiny of our dream america believe america be ready america can win the race to the future and we shall the american dream be a song of hope that ring through night winter air vivid tender music that warm our heart when the least among we aspire to the great thing to venture a daring enterprise to unearth new beauty in music literature and art to discover a new universe inside a tiny silicon chip or a single human cell

 we see the dream come true in the spirit of discovery of richard cavoli all his life he be be enthral by the mystery of medicine and richard we know that the experiment that you begin in high school be launch and lose last week yet your dream live and as long as it be real work of noble note will yet be do work that could reduce the harmful effect of x ray on patient and enable astronomer to view the golden gateway of the farth star

 we see the dream glow in the tower talent of a 12 year old tyrone ford a child prodigy of gospel music he have surmount personal adversity to become an accomplished pianist and singer he also direct the choir of three church and have perform at the kennedy center with god as your composer tyrone your music will be the music of angel

 we see the dream be save by the courage of the 13 year old shelby butler honor student and member of her school 's safety patrol see another girl freeze in terror before an out of control school bus she risk her life and pull she to safety with bravery like your shelby america need never fear for our future

 and we see the dream bear again in the joyful compassion of a 13 year old trevor ferrell two year ago age 11 watch man and woman bed down in abandon doorway on television he be watch trevor leave his suburban philadelphia home to bring blanket and food to the helpless and homeless and now 250 people help he fulfill his nightly vigil trevor yours be the live spirit of brotherly love

 would you four stand up for a moment thank you thank you you be hero of our heart we look at you and know it be true in this land of dream fulfil where great dream may be imagine nothing be impossible no victory be beyond our reach no glory will ever be too great

 so now it be up to we all of we to prepare america for that day when our work will pale before the greatness of america 's champion in the 21st century the world 's hope rest with america 's future america 's hope rest with we so let we go forward to create our world of tomorrow in faith in unity and in love

 god bless you and god bless america

my fellow americans

 at 7 o'clock this evening eastern time air and naval force of the united states launch a series of strike against the headquarters terrorist facility and military asset that support mu'ammar qadhafi 's subversive activity the attack be concentrate and carefully target to minimize casualty among the libyan people with whom we have no quarrel from initial report our force have succeed in their mission

 several week ago in new orleans i warn colonel qadhafi we would hold his regime accountable for any new terrorist attack launch against american citizen more recently i make it clear we would respond as soon as we determine conclusively who be responsible for such attack on april 5th in west berlin a terrorist bomb explode in a nightclub frequent by american servicemen sergeant kenneth ford and a young turkish woman be kill and 230 other be wound among they some 50 american military personnel this monstrous brutality be but the late act in colonel qadhafi 's reign of terror the evidence be now conclusive that the terrorist bombing of la belle discotheque be plan and execute under the direct order of the libyan regime on march 25th more than a week before the attack order be send from tripoli to the libyan people 's bureau in east berlin to conduct a terrorist attack against americans to cause maximum and indiscriminate casualty libya 's agent then plant the bomb on april 4th the people 's bureau alert tripoli that the attack would be carry out the follow morning the next day they report back to tripoli on the great success of their mission

 our evidence be direct it be precise it be irrefutable we have solid evidence about other attack qadhafi have plan against the united states installation and diplomat and even american tourist thank to close cooperation with our friend some of these have be prevent with the help of french authority we recently abort one such attack a plan massacre use grenade and small arm of civilian wait in line for visa at an american embassy

 colonel qadhafi be not only an enemy of the united states his record of subversion and aggression against the neighboring state in africa be well document and well know he have order the murder of fellow libyans in countless country he have sanction act of terror in africa europe and the middle east as well as the western hemisphere today we have do what we have to do if necessary we shall do it again it give i no pleasure to say that and i wish it be otherwise before qadhafi seize power in 1969 the people of libya have be friend of the united states and i be sure that today most libyans be ashamed and disgust that this man have make their country a synonym for barbarism around the world the libyan people be a decent people catch in the grip of a tyrant

 to our friend and ally in europe who cooperate in today 's mission i would only say you have the permanent gratitude of the american people europeans who remember history understand well than most that there be no security no safety in the appeasement of evil it must be the core of western policy that there be no sanctuary for terror and to sustain such a policy free man and free nation must unite and work together sometimes it be say that by impose sanction against colonel qadhafi or by strike at his terrorist installation we only magnify the man 's importance that the proper way to deal with he be to ignore he i do not agree

 long before i come into this office colonel qadhafi have engage in act of international terror act that put he outside the company of civilized man for year however he suffer no economic or political or military sanction and the atrocity mount in number as do the innocent dead and wound and for we to ignore by inaction the slaughter of american civilian and american soldier whether in nightclub or airline terminal be simply not in the american tradition when our citizen be abuse or attack anywhere in the world on the direct order of a hostile regime we will respond so long as i be in this oval office self defense be not only our right it be our duty it be the purpose behind the mission undertake tonight a mission fully consistent with article 51 of the united nations charter

 we believe that this preemptive action against his terrorist installation will not only diminish colonel qadhafi 's capacity to export terror it will provide he with incentive and reason to alter his criminal behavior i have no illusion that tonight 's action will ring down the curtain on qadhafi 's reign of terror but this mission violent though it be can bring close a safe and more secure world for decent man and woman we will persevere this afternoon we consult with the leader of congress regard what we be about to do and why tonight i salute the skill and professionalism of the man and woman of our armed forces who carry out this mission it be an honor to be your commander in chief

 we americans be slow to anger we always seek peaceful avenue before resort to the use of force and we do we try quiet diplomacy public condemnation economic sanction and demonstration of military force none succeed despite our repeat warning qadhafi continue his reckless policy of intimidation his relentless pursuit of terror he count on america to be passive he count wrong i warn that there should be no place on earth where terrorist can rest and train and practice their deadly skill i mean it i say that we would act with other if possible and alone if necessary to ensure that terrorist have no sanctuary anywhere tonight we have

 thank you and god bless you





the president good evening usually i talk with you from my office in the west wing of the white house but tonight there be something special to talk about and i have ask someone very special to join i nancy and i be here in the west hall of the white house and around we be the room in which we live it be the home you have provide for we of which we merely have temporary custody

 nancy 's join i because the message this evening be not my message but our and we speak to you not simply as fellow citizen but as fellow parent and grandparent and as concerned neighbor it be back to school time for america 's child and while drug and alcohol abuse cut across all generation it be especially damaging to the young people on whom our future depend so tonight from our family to your from our home to yours thank you for join we

 america have accomplish so much in these last few year whether it be be rebuild our economy or serve the cause of freedom in the world what we have be able to achieve have be do with your help with we work together as a nation unite now we need your support again drug be menace our society they be threaten our value and undercut our institution they be kill our child

 from the beginning of our administration we have take strong step to do something about this horror tonight i can report to you that we have make much progress thirty seven federal agency be work together in a vigorous national effort and by next year our spending for drug law enforcement will have more than triple from its 1981 level we have increase seizure of illegal drug shortage of marijuana be now be report last year alone over 10,000 drug criminal be convict and nearly $ 250 million of their asset be seize by the dea the drug enforcement administration

 and in the most important area individual use we see progress in 4 year the number of high school senior use marijuana on a daily basis have drop from 1 in 14 to 1 in 20 the u.s. military have cut the use of illegal drug among its personnel by 67 percent since 1980 these be a measure of our commitment and emerge sign that we can defeat this enemy but we still have much to do

 despite our good effort illegal cocaine be come into our country at alarming level and 4 to 5 million people regularly use it five hundred thousand americans be hook on heroin one in twelve person smoke marijuana regularly regular drug use be even high among the age group 18 to 25 most likely just enter the workforce today there be a new epidemic smokable cocaine otherwise know as crack it be an explosively destructive and often lethal substance which be crush its user it be an uncontrolled fire

 and drug abuse be not a so call victimless crime everyone 's safety be at stake when drug and excessive alcohol be use by people on the highway or by those transport our citizen or operate industrial equipment drug abuse cost you and your fellow americans at least $ 60 billion a year

 from the early day of our administration nancy have be intensely involve in the effort to fight drug abuse she have since travel over 100,000 mile to 55 city in 28 states and 6 foreign country to fight school age drug and alcohol abuse she be give dozen of speech and score of interview and have participate in 24 special radio and tv taping to create great awareness of this crisis her personal observation and effort have give she such dramatic insight that i want she to share they with you this evening
 nancy

 mrs. reagan thank you as a mother i have always think of september as a special month a time when we bundle our child off to school to the warmth of an environment in which they could fulfill the promise and hope in those restless mind but so much have happen over these last year so much to shake the foundation of all that we know and all that we believe in today there be a drug and alcohol abuse epidemic in this country and no one be safe from it not you not i and certainly not our child because this epidemic have their name write on it many of you may be think well drug do not concern i but it do concern you it concern we all because of the way it tear at our life and because it be aim at destroy the brightness and life of the son and daughter of the united states

 for 5 year i have be travel across the country learn and listening and one of the most hopeful sign i have see be the building of an essential new awareness of how terrible and threaten drug abuse be to our society this be one of the main purpose when i start so of course it make i happy that that be be accomplish but each time i meet with someone new or receive another letter from a troubled person on drug i yearn to find a way to help share the message that cry out from they as a parent i be especially concerned about what drug be do to young mother and their newborn child listen to this news account from a hospital in florida of a child bear to a mother with a cocaine habit nearby a baby name paul lie motionless in an incubator feed tube riddle his tiny body he need a respirator to breathe and a daily spinal tap to relieve fluid buildup on his brain only 1 month old he be already suffer 2 stroke

 now you can see why drug abuse concern every one of we all the american family drug steal away so much they take and take until finally every time a drug go into a child something else be force out like love and hope and trust and confidence drug take away the dream from every child 's heart and replace it with a nightmare and it be time we in america stand up and replace those dream each of we have to put our principle and conscience on the line whether in social setting or in the workplace to set forth solid standard and stick to they there be no moral middle ground indifference be not an option we want you to help we create an outspoken intolerance for drug use for the sake of our child i implore each of you to be unyielde and inflexible in your opposition to drug

 our young people be help we lead the way not long ago in oakland california i be ask by a group of child what to do if they be offer drug and i answer just say no soon after that those child in oakland form a just say no club and now there be over 10,000 such club all over the country well their participation and their courage in say no need our encouragement we can help by use every opportunity to force the issue of not use drug to the point of make other uncomfortable even if it mean make ourselves unpopular

 our job be never easy because drug criminal be ingenious they work everyday to plot a new and well way to steal our child 's life just as they have do by develop this new drug crack for every door that we close they open a new door to death they prosper on our unwillingness to act so we must be smart and strong and tough than they be it be up to we to change attitude and just simply dry up their market

 and finally to young people watch or listen i have a very personal message for you there be a big wonderful world out there for you it belong to you it be exciting and stimulating and rewarding do not cheat yourself out of this promise our country need you but it need you to be clear eyed and clear minded i recently read one teenager 's story she be now determined to stay clean but be once string out on several drug what she remember most clearly about her recovery be that during the time she be on drug everything appear to she in shade of black and gray and after her treatment she be able to see color again

 so to my young friend out there life can be great but not when you can not see it so open your eye to life to see it in the vivid color that god give we as a precious gift to his child to enjoy life to the full and to make it count say yes to your life and when it come to drug and alcohol just say no

 the president i think you can see why nancy have be such a positive influence on all that we be try to do the job ahead of we be very clear nancy 's personal crusade like that of so many other wonderful individual should become our national crusade it must include a combination of government and private effort which complement one another last month i announce six initiative which we believe will do just that

 first we seek a drug free workplace at all level of government and in the private sector second we will work toward drug free school third we want to ensure that the public be protect and that treatment be available to substance abuser and the chemically dependent our fourth goal be to expand international cooperation while treat drug trafficking as a threat to our national security in october 1 will be meet with key u.s. ambassadors to discuss what can be do to support our friend abroad fifth we must move to strengthen law enforcement activity such as those initiate by vice president bush and attorney general meese and finally we seek to expand public awareness and prevention

 in order to far implement these six goal i will announce tomorrow a series of new proposal for a drug free america take as a whole these proposal will toughen our law against drug criminal encourage more research and treatment and ensure that illegal drug will not be tolerate in our school or in our workplace together with our ongoing effort these proposal will bring the federal commitment to fight drug to $ 3 billion as much financing as we commit however we would be fool ourselves if we think that massive new amount of money alone will provide the solution let we not forget that in america people solve problem and no national crusade have ever succeed without human investment win the crusade against drug will not be achieve by just throw money at the problem

 your government will continue to act aggressively but nothing would be more effective than for americans simply to quit use illegal drug we seek to create a massive change in national attitude which ultimately will separate the drug from the customer to take the user away from the supply i believe quite simply that we can help they quit and that be where you come in

 my generation will remember how america swing into action when we be attack in world war ii the war be not just fight by the fellow fly the plane or drive the tank it be fight at home by a mobilized nation man and woman alike build plane and ship clothing sailor and soldier feed marine and airman and it be fight by child plant victory garden and collect can well now we be in another war for our freedom and it be time for all of we to pull together again so for example if your friend or neighbor or a family member have a drug or alcohol problem do not turn the other way go to his help or to hers get other involve with you club service group and community organization and provide support and strength and of course many of you have be cure through treatment and self help well you be the combat veteran and you have a critical role to play you can help other by tell your story and provide a willing hand to those in need be friend to other be the good way of be friend to ourselves it be time as nancy say for america to just say no to drug

 those of you in union hall and workplace everywhere please make this challenge a part of your job every day help we preserve the health and dignity of all worker to business large and small we need the creativity of your enterprise apply directly to this national problem help we and those of you who be educator your wisdom and leadership be indispensable to this cause from the pulpit of this spirit fill land we would welcome your reassuring message of redemption and forgiveness and of help one another on the athletic field you man and woman be among the most beloved citizen of our country a child 's eye fill with your heroic achievement few of we can give youngster something as special and strong to look up to as you please do not let they down

 the president god bless you and good night

good evening as most of you know i have just return from meeting in iceland with the leader of the soviet union general secretary gorbachev as i do last year when i return from the summit conference in geneva i want to take a few moment tonight to share with you what take place in these discussion the implication of these talk be enormous and only just begin to be understand we propose the most sweeping and generous arm control proposal in history we offer the complete elimination of all ballistic missile soviet and american from the face of the earth by 1996 while we part company with this american offer still on the table we be close than ever before to agreement that could lead to a safe world without nuclear weapon

 but first let i tell you that from the start of my meeting with mr. gorbachev i have always regard you the american people as full participant believe i without your support none of these talk could have be hold nor could the ultimate aim of american foreign policy world peace and freedom be pursue and it be for these aim i go the extra mile to iceland before i report on our talk though allow i to set the stage by explain two thing that be very much a part of our talk one a treaty and the other a defense against nuclear missile which we be try to develop now you have hear their title a thousand time the abm treaty and sdi well those letter stand for abm antiballistic missile sdi strategic defense initiative

 some year ago the united states and the soviet union agree to limit any defense against nuclear missile attack to the emplacement in one location in each country of a small number of missile capable of intercept and shoot down incoming nuclear missile thus leave our real defense a policy call mutual assure destruction mean if one side launch a nuclear attack the other side could retaliate and this mutual threat of destruction be believe to be a deterrent against either side strike first so here we sit with thousand of nuclear warhead target on each other and capable of wipe out both our country the soviets deploy the few antiballistic missile around moscow as the treaty permit our country do not bother deploy because the threat of nationwide annihilation make such a limited defense seem useless

 for some year now we have be aware that the soviets may be develop a nationwide defense they have instal a large modern radar at krasnoyarsk which we believe be a critical part of a radar system design to provide radar guidance for antiballistic missile protect the entire nation now this be a violation of the abm treaty believe that a policy of mutual destruction and slaughter of their citizen and our be uncivilized i ask our military a few year ago to study and see if there be a practical way to destroy nuclear missile after their launch but before they can reach their target rather than to just destroy people well this be the goal for what we call sdi and our scientist research such a system be convince it be practical and that several year down the road we can have such a system ready to deploy now incidentally we be not violate the abm treaty which permit such research if and when we deploy the treaty also allow withdrawal from the treaty upon 6 month notice sdi let i make it clear be a nonnuclear defense

 so here we be at iceland for our second such meeting in the first and in the month in between we have discuss way to reduce and in fact eliminate nuclear weapon entirely we and the soviets have have team of negotiator in geneva try to work out a mutual agreement on how we could reduce or eliminate nuclear weapon and so far no success on saturday and sunday general secretary gorbachev and his foreign minister shevardnadze and secretary of state george shultz and i meet for nearly 10 hour we do not limit ourselves to just arm reduction we discuss what we call violation of human right on the part of the soviets refusal to let people emigrate from russia so they can practice their religion without be persecute let people go to rejoin their family husband and wife separate by national border be allow to reunite

 in much of this the soviet union be violate another agreement the helsinki accord they have sign in 1975 yuriy orlov whose freedom we just obtain be imprison for point out to his government its violation of that pact its refusal to let citizen leave their country or return we also discuss regional matter such as afghanistan angola nicaragua and cambodia but by their choice the main subject be arm control we discuss the emplacement of intermediate range missile in europe and asia and seem to be in agreement they could be drastically reduce both side seem willing to find a way to reduce even to zero the strategic ballistic missile we have aim at each other this then bring up the subject of sdi

 i offer a proposal that we continue our present research and if and when we reach the stage of testing we would sign now a treaty that would permit soviet observation of such test and if the program be practical we would both eliminate our offensive missile and then we would share the benefit of advanced defense i explain that even though we would have do away with our offensive ballistic missile have the defense would protect against cheating or the possibility of a madman sometime decide to create nuclear missile after all the world now know how to make they i liken it to our keep our gas mask even though the nation of the world have outlaw poison gas after world war i. we seem to be make progress on reduce weaponry although the general secretary be register opposition to sdi and propose a pledge to observe abm for a number of year as the day be end

 secretary shultz suggest we turn over the note our note taker have be make of everything we have say to our respective team and let they work through the night to put they together and find just where we be in agreement and what difference separate we with respect and gratitude i can inform you those team work through the night till 6:30 a.m. yesterday sunday morning mr. gorbachev and i with our foreign minister come together again and take up the report of our two team it be most promising

 the soviets have ask for a 10 year delay in the deployment of sdi program in an effort to see how we could satisfy their concern while protect our principle and security we propose a 10 year period in which we begin with the reduction of all strategic nuclear arm bomber airlaunche cruise missile intercontinental ballistic missile submarine launch ballistic missile and the weapon they carry they would be reduce 50 percent in the first five year during the next five year we would continue by eliminate all remain offensive ballistic missile of all range and during that time we would proceed with research development and testing of sdi all do in conformity with abm provision at the 10 year point with all ballistic missile eliminate we could proceed to deploy advanced defense at the same time permit the soviets to do likewise

 and here the debate begin the general secretary want word that in effect would have keep we from develop the sdi for the entire 10 year in effect he be kill sdi and unless i agree all that work toward eliminate nuclear weapon would go down the drain cancel i tell he i have pledge to the american people that i would not trade away sdi there be no way i could tell our people their government would not protect they against nuclear destruction i go to reykjavik determine that everything be negotiable except two thing our freedom and our future i be still optimistic that a way will be find the door be open and the opportunity to begin eliminate the nuclear threat be within reach

 so you can see we make progress in iceland and we will continue to make progress if we pursue a prudent deliberate and above all realistic approach with the soviets from the early day of our administration this have be our policy we make it clear we have no illusion about the soviets or their ultimate intention we be publicly candid about the critical moral distinction between totalitarianism and democracy we declare the principal objective of american foreign policy to be not just the prevention of war but the extension of freedom and we stress our commitment to the growth of democratic government and democratic institution around the world and that be why we assist freedom fighter who be resist the imposition of totalitarian rule in afghanistan nicaragua angola cambodia and elsewhere and finally we begin work on what i believe most spur the soviets to negotiate seriously rebuild our military strength reconstruct our strategic deterrence and above all begin work on the strategic defense initiative

 and yet at the same time we set out these foreign policy goal and begin work toward they we pursue another of our major objective that of seek mean to lessen tension with the soviets and way to prevent war and keep the peace now this policy be now pay dividend one sign of this in iceland be the progress on the issue of arm control for the first time in a long while soviet american negotiation in the area of arm reduction be move and move in the right direction not just toward arm control but toward arm reduction

 but for all the progress we make on arm reduction we must remember there be other issue on the table in iceland issue that be fundamental as i mention one such issue be human right as president kennedy once say and be not peace in the last analysis basically a matter of human right i make it plain that the united states would not seek to exploit improvement in these matter for purpose of propaganda but i also make it plain once again that an improvement of the human condition within the soviet union be indispensable for an improvement in bilateral relation with the united states for a government that will break faith with its own people can not be trust to keep faith with foreign power so i tell mr. gorbachev again in reykjavik as i have in geneva we americans place far less weight upon the word that be speak at meeting such as these than upon the deed that follow when it come to human right and judge soviet intention we be all from missouri you got to show we

 another subject area we take up in iceland also lie at the heart of the difference between the soviet union and america this be the issue of regional conflict summit meeting can not make the american people forget what soviet action have mean for the people of afghanistan central america africa and southeast asia until soviet policy change we will make sure that our friend in these area those who fight for freedom and independence will have the support they need

 finally there be a fourth item and this area be that of bilateral relation people to people contact in geneva last year we welcome several cultural exchange accord in iceland we see indication of more movement in these area but let i say now the united states remain committed to people to people program that could lead to exchange between not just a few elite but thousand of everyday citizen from both our country

 so i think then that you can see that we do make progress in iceland on a broad range of topic we reaffirm our fourpoint agenda we discover major new ground of agreement we probe again some old area of disagreement

 and let i return again to the sdi issue i realize some americans may be ask tonight why not accept mr. gorbachev 's demand why not give up sdi for this agreement well the answer my friend be simple sdi be america 's insurance policy that the soviet union would keep the commitment make at reykjavik sdi be america 's security guarantee if the soviets should as they have do too often in the past fail to comply with their solemn commitment sdi be what bring the soviets back to arm control talk at geneva and iceland sdi be the key to a world without nuclear weapon the soviets understand this they have devote far more resource for a lot long time than we to their own sdi the world 's only operational missile defense today surround moscow the capital of the soviet union

 what mr. gorbachev be demand at reykjavik be that the united states agree to a new version of a 14 year old abm treaty that the soviet union have already violate i tell he we do not make those kind of deal in the united states and the american people should reflect on these critical question how do a defense of the united states threaten the soviet union or anyone else why be the soviets so adamant that america remain forever vulnerable to soviet rocket attack as of today all free nation be utterly defenseless against soviet missile fire either by accident or design why do the soviet union insist that we remain so forever

 so my fellow americans i can not promise nor can any president promise that the talk in iceland or any future discussion with mr. gorbachev will lead inevitably to great breakthrough or momentous treaty signing we will not abandon the guide principle we take to reykjavik we prefer no agreement than to bring home a bad agreement to the united states and on this point i know you be also interested in the question of whether there will be another summit there be no indication by mr. gorbachev as to when or whether he plan to travel to the united states as we agree he would last year in geneva i repeat tonight that our invitation stand and that we continue to believe additional meeting would be useful but that be a decision the soviets must make

 but whatever the immediate prospect i can tell you that i be ultimately hopeful about the prospect for progress at the summit and for world peace and freedom you see the current summit process be very different from that of previous decade it be different because the world be different and the world be different because of the hard work and sacrifice of the american people during the past five and a half year your energy have restore and expand our economic might your support have restore our military strength your courage and sense of national unity in time of crisis have give pause to our adversary hearten our friend and inspire the world the western democracy and the nato alliance be revitalize and all across the world nation be turn to democratic idea and the principle of the free market so because the american people stand guard at the critical hour freedom have gather its force regain its strength and be on the march

 so if there be one impression i carry away with i from these october talk it be that unlike the past we be deal now from a position of strength and for that reason we have it within our grasp to move speedily with the soviets toward even more breakthrough our idea be out there on the table they will not go away we be ready to pick up where we leave off our negotiator be head back to geneva and we be prepared to go forward whenever and wherever the soviet be ready so there ' reason good reason for hope i see evidence of this be in the progress we make in the talk with mr. gorbachev and i see evidence of it when we leave iceland yesterday and i speak to our young man and woman at our naval installation at keflavik a critically important base far close to soviet naval basis than to our own coastline

 as always i be proud to spend a few moment with they and thank they for their sacrifice and devotion to country they represent america at her fine commit to defend not only our own freedom but the freedom of other who would be live in a far more frightening world be it not for the strength and resolve of the united states whenever the standard of freedom and independence have be unfurl there will be america 's heart her benediction and her prayer john quincy adams once say he speak well of our destiny as a nation my fellow americans we be honor by history entrust by destiny with the old dream of humanity the dream of last peace and human freedom

 another president harry truman note that our century have see two of the most frightful war in history and that the supreme need of our time be for man to learn to live together in peace and harmony it be in pursuit of that ideal i go to geneva a year ago and to iceland last week and it be in pursuit of that ideal that i thank you now for all the support you have give i and i again ask for your help and your prayer as we continue our journey toward a world where peace reign and freedom be enshrine

 thank you and god bless you





thank you all please be seat well thank you and welcome to the white house in a moment i will be sit at that desk take up a pen and sign the most sweeping overhaul of our tax code in our nation 's history to all of you here today who have work so long and hard to see this day come my thank and the thank of a nation go out to you

 the journey be be long and many say we would never make it to the end but as usual the pessimist leave one thing out of their calculation the american people they have not make this the free country and the mighty economic force on this planet by shrink from challenge they never give up and after almost 3 year of commitment and hard work one headline in the washington post tell the whole story the impossible become the inevitable and the dream of america 's fair share tax plan become a reality

 when i sign this bill into law america will have the low marginal tax rate and the most modern tax code among major industrialize nation one that encourage risk taking innovation and that old american spirit of enterprise we will be refuel the american growth economy with the kind of incentive that help create record new business and nearly 11.7 million job in just 46 month fair and simple for most americans this be a tax code design to take we into a future of technological invention and economic achievement one that will keep america competitive and grow into the 21st century

 but for all tax reform 's economic benefit i believe that history will record this moment as something more as the return to the first principle this country be found on faith in the individual not group or class but faith in the resource and bounty of each and every separate human soul our founding fathers design a democratic form of government to enlist the individual 's energy and fashion a bill of rights to protect its freedom and in so do they tap a wellspring of hope and creativity that be to completely transform history

 the history of these united states of america be indeed a history of individual achievement it be their hard work that build our city and farm our prairie their genius that continually push we beyond the boundary of exist knowledge reshape our world with the steam engine polio vaccine and the silicon chip it be their faith in freedom and love of country that sustain we through trial and hardship and through war and it be their courage and selflessness that enable we to always prevail

 but when our founding fathers design this government of by and for the people they never imagine what we have come to know as the progressive income tax when the income tax be first levy in 1913 the top rate be only 7 percent on people with income over $ 500,000 now that be the equivalent of multimillionaire today but in our lifetime we have see marginal tax rate skyrocket as high as 90 percent and not even the poor have be spare as tax rate escalate the tax code grow ever more tangled and complex a haven for special interest and tax manipulator but an impossible frustration for everybody else blatantly unfair our tax code become a source of bitterness and discouragement for the average taxpayer it be not too much to call it un american

 meanwhile the steeply progressive nature of the tax strike at the heart of the economic life of the individual punish that special effort and extra hard work that have always be the drive force of our economy as government 's hunger for ever more revenue expand family see tax cut or taxis i should say cut deeply and deep into their paycheck and taxation fall most cruelly on the poor make a difficult climb up from poverty even hard throughout history the oppressive hand of government have fall most heavily on the economic life of the individual and more often than not it be inflation and taxis that have undermine livelihood and constrain their freedom we should not forget that this nation of our begin in a revolt against oppressive taxation our founding fathers fight not only for our political right but also to secure the economic freedom without which these political freedom be no more than a shadow

 in the last 20 year we have witness an expansion and strengthening of many of our civil liberty but our economic liberty have too often be neglect and even abuse we protect the freedom of expression of the author as we should but what of the freedom of expression of the entrepreneur whose pen and paper be capital and profit whose book may be a new invention or small business what of the creator of our economic life whose contribution may not only delight the mind but improve the condition of man by feed the poor with new grain bring hope to the sick with new cure vanish ignorance with wondrous new information technology

 and what about fairness for family it be in our family that america 's most important work get do raise our next generation but over the last 40 year as inflation have shrink the personal exemption family with child have have to shoulder more and more of the tax burden with inflation and bracket creep also erode income many spouse who would rather stay home with their child have be force to go look for job and what of america 's promise of hope and opportunity that with hard work even the poor among we can gain the security and happiness that be the due of all americans you can not put a price tag on the american dream that dream be the heart and soul of america it be the promise that keep our nation forever good and generous a model and hope to the world

 for all these reason this tax bill be less a freedom or a reform i should say than a revolution million of work poor will be drop from the tax roll altogether and family will get a long overdue break with low rate and an almost double personal exemption we be go to make it economical to raise child again flatter rate will mean more reward for that extra effort and vanish loophole and a minimum tax will mean that everybody and every corporation pay their fair share and that be why i be certain that the bill i be sign today be not only an historic overhaul of our tax code and a sweeping victory for fairness it be also the good antipoverty bill the good profamily measure and the good job creation program ever to come out of the congress of the united states

 and now that we have come this far we can not and we will not allow tax reform to be undo with tax rate hike we must restore certainty to our tax code and our economy and i will oppose with all my might any attempt to raise tax rate on the american people and i hope that all here will join with i to make permanent the historic progress of tax reform i think all of we here today know what a herculean effort it take to get this landmark bill to my desk that effort do not start here in washington but begin with the many thinker who have struggle to return economic to its classical root to an understanding that ultimately the economy be not make up of aggregate like government spending and consumer demand but of individual man and woman each strive to provide for his family and well his or her lot in life

 but we must also salute those courageous leader in the congress who have make this day possible to bob packwood dan rostenkowski russell long john duncan and majority leader bob dole to jack kemp bob kasten bill bradley and dick gephardt who pioneer with their own version of tax reform i salute all of you and all the other members of the senate and house whose effort pay off and whose vote finally win the day and last but not least the many member of the administration who must often have feel that they be fight a lonely battle against overwhelming odd particularly my two incomparable secretaries of the treasury don regan and jim baker and i thank they from the bottom of my heart i feel like we just play the world series of tax reform laughter and the american people win





mr. speaker mr. president distinguished members of congress honored guest and fellow citizen

 may i congratulate all of you who be member of this historic 100th congress of the united states of america in this 200th anniversary year of our constitution you and i stand on the shoulder of giant man whose word and deed put wind in the sail of freedom however we must always remember that our constitution be to be celebrate not for be old but for be young young with the same energy spirit and promise that fill each eventful day in philadelphia 's statehouse we will be guide tonight by their act and we will be guide forever by their word

 now there be a new face at this place of honor tonight and please join i in warm congratulation to the speaker of the house jim wright mr. speaker you might recall a similar situation in your very first session of congress 32 year ago then as now the speakership have change hand and another great son of texas sam rayburn—"mr sam"—sat in your chair i can not find well word than those use by president eisenhower that evening he say we shall have much to do together i be sure that we will get it do and that we shall do it in harmony and good will tonight i renew that pledge to you mr. speaker and to senate majority leader robert byrd who bring 34 year of distinguished service to the congress may i say though there be change in the congress america 's interest remain the same and i be confident that along with republican leader bob michel and bob dole this congress can make history

 six year ago i be here to ask the congress to join i in america 's new beginning well the result be something of which we can all be proud our inflation rate be now the low in a quarter of a century the prime interest rate have fall from the 21 1/2 percent the month before we take office to 7 1/2 percent today and those rate have trigger the most housing start in 8 year the unemployment rate still too high be the low in nearly 7 year and our people have create nearly 13 million new job over 61 percent of everyone over the age of 16 male and female be employ the high percentage on record let us roll up our sleeve and go to work and put america 's economic engine at full throttle we can also be hearten by our progress across the world most important america be at peace tonight and freedom be on the march and we have do much these past year to restore our defense our alliance and our leadership in the world our son and daughter in the service once again wear their uniform with pride

 but though we have make much progress i have one major regret i take a risk with regard to our action in iran it do not work and for that i assume full responsibility the goal be worthy i do not believe it be wrong to try to establish contact with a country of strategic importance or to try to save life and certainly it be not wrong to try to secure freedom for our citizen hold in barbaric captivity but we do not achieve what we wish and serious mistake be make in try to do so we will get to the bottom of this and i will take whatever action be call for but in debate the past we must not deny ourselves the success of the future let it never be say of this generation of americans that we become so obsessed with failure that we refuse to take risk that could further the cause of peace and freedom in the world much be at stake here and the nation and the world be watch to see if we go forward together in the national interest or if we let partisanship weaken we and let there be no mistake about american policy we will not sit idly by if our interest or our friend in the middle east be threaten nor will we yield to terrorist blackmail

 and now lady and gentleman of the congress why do not we get to work i be pleased to report that because of our effort to rebuild the strength of america the world be a safe place early this month i submit a budget to defend america and maintain our momentum to make up for neglect in the last decade well i ask you to vote out a defense and foreign affair budget that say yes to protect our country while the world be safe it be not safe

 since 1970 the soviets have invest $ 500 billion more on their military force than we have even today though nearly 1 in 3 soviet family be without run hot water and the average family spend 2 hour a day shop for the basic necessity of life their government still find the resource to transfer $ 75 billion in weapon to client state in the past 5 year client like syria vietnam cuba libya angola ethiopia afghanistan and nicaragua with 120,000 soviet combat and military personnel and 15,000 military adviser in asia africa and latin america can anyone still doubt their single minded determination to expand their power despite this the congress cut my request for critical u.s. security assistance to free nation by 21 percent this year and cut defense request by $ 85 billion in the last 3 year

 these assistance program serve our national interest as well as mutual interest and when the program be devastate american interest be harm my friend it be my duty as president to say to you again tonight that there be no surer way to lose freedom than to lose our resolve today the brave people of afghanistan be show that resolve the soviet union say it want a peaceful settlement in afghanistan yet it continue a brutal war and prop up a regime whose day be clearly number we be ready to support a political solution that guarantee the rapid withdrawal of all soviet troop and genuine self determination for the afghan people

 in central america too the cause of freedom be be test and our resolve be be test there as well here especially the world be watch to see how this nation respond today over 90 percent of the people of latin america live in democracy democracy be on the march in central and south america communist nicaragua be the odd man out suppress the church the press and democratic dissent and promote subversion in the region we support diplomatic effort but these effort can never succeed if the sandinista win their war against the nicaraguan people

 our commitment to a western hemisphere safe from aggression do not occur by spontaneous generation on the day that we take office it begin with the monroe doctrine in 1823 and continue our historic bipartisan american policy franklin roosevelt say we be determined to do everything possible to maintain peace on this hemisphere president truman be very blunt international communism seek to crush and undermine and destroy the independence of the americas we can not let that happen here and john f. kennedy make clear that communist domination in this hemisphere can never be negotiate some in this congress may choose to depart from this historic commitment but i will not

 this year we celebrate the second century of our constitution the sandinistas just sign theirs two week ago and then suspend it we will not know how my word tonight will be report there for one simple reason there be no free press in nicaragua nicaraguan freedom fighter have never ask we to wage their battle but i will fight any effort to shut off their lifeblood and consign they to death defeat or a life without freedom there must be no soviet beachhead in central america

 you know we americans have always prefer dialog to conflict and so we always remain open to more constructive relation with the soviet union but more responsible soviet conduct around the world be a key element of the u.s.-soviet agenda progress be also require on the other item of our agenda as well real respect for human right and more open contact between our society and of course arm reduction

 in iceland last october we have one moment of opportunity that the soviets dash because they seek to cripple our strategic defense initiative sdi i would not let they do it then i will not let they do it now or in the future this be the most positive and promising defense program we have undertake it be the path for both side to a safe future a system that defend human life instead of threaten it sdi will go forward the united states have make serious fair and far reach proposal to the soviet union and this be a moment of rare opportunity for arm reduction but i will need and american negotiator in geneva will need congress support enact the soviet negotiating position into american law would not be the way to win a good agreement so i must tell you in this congress i will veto any effort that undercut our national security and our negotiate leverage

 now today we also find ourselves engage in expand peaceful commerce across the world we will work to expand our opportunity in international market through the uruguay round of trade negotiation and to complete an historic free trade arrangement between the world 's two large trading partner canada and the united states our basic trade policy remain the same we remain opposed as ever to protectionism because america 's growth and future depend on trade but we would insist on trade that be fair and free we be always willing to be trade partner but never trade patsy

 now from foreign border let we return to our own because america in the world be only as strong as america at home this 100th congress have high responsibility i begin with a gentle reminder that many of these be simply the incomplete obligation of the past the american people deserve to be impatient because we do not yet have the public house in order we have have great success in restore our economic integrity and we have rescue our nation from the bad economic mess since the depression but there be more to do for starter the federal deficit be outrageous for year i have ask that we stop push onto our child the excess of our government and what the congress finally need to do be pass a constitutional amendment that mandate a balanced budget and force government to live within its mean state city and the family of america balance their budget why can not we

 next the budget process be a sorry spectacle the missing of deadline and the nightmare of monstrous continue resolution pack hundred of billion of dollar of spending into one bill must be stop we ask the congress once again give we the same tool that 43 governor have a lineitem veto so we can carve out the boondoggle and pork those item that would never survive on their own i will send the congress broad recommendation on the budget but first i would like to see your let us go to work and get this do together

 but now let us talk about this year 's budget even though i have submit it within the gramm rudman hollings deficit reduction target i have see suggestion that we might postpone that timetable well i think the american people be tired of hear the same old excuse together we make a commitment to balance the budget now let us keep it as for those suggestion that the answer be high taxis the american people have repeatedly reject that shop wear advice they know that we do not have deficit because people be tax too little we have deficit because big government spend too much

 now next month i will place two additional reform before the congress we have create a welfare monster that be a shocking indictment of our sense of priority our national welfare system consist of some 59 major program and over 6,000 page of federal law and regulation on which more than $ 132 billion be spend in 1985 i will propose a new national welfare strategy a program of welfare reform through state sponsor community base demonstration project this be the time to reform this outmoded social dinosaur and finally break the poverty trap now we will never abandon those who through no fault of their own must have our help but let we work to see how many can be free from the dependency of welfare and make self support which the great majority of welfare recipient want more than anything else next let we remove a financial specter face our old americans the fear of an illness so expensive that it can result in have to make an intolerable choice between bankruptcy and death i will submit legislation shortly to help free the elderly from the fear of catastrophic illness

 now let us turn to the future it be widely say that america be lose her competitive edge well that will not happen if we act now how well prepared be we to enter the 21st century in my lifetime america set the standard for the world it be now time to determine that we should enter the next century having achieve a level of excellence unsurpasse in history we will achieve this first by guarantee that government do everything possible to promote america 's ability to compete second we must act as individual in a quest for excellence that will not be measure by new proposal or billion in new funding rather it involve an expenditure of american spirit and just plain american grit the congress will soon receive my comprehensive proposal to enhance our competitiveness include new science and technology center and strong new funding for basic research the bill will include legal and regulatory reform and weapon to fight unfair trade practice competitiveness also mean give our farmer a shot at participate fairly and fully in a change world market

 prepare for the future must begin as always with our child we need to set for they new and more rigorous goal we must demand more of ourselves and our child by raise literacy level dramatically by the year 2000 our child should master the basic concept of math and science and let us insist that student not leave high school until they have study and understand the basic document of our national heritage there be one more thing we can not let up on let us redouble our personal effort to provide for every child a safe and drug free learning environment if our crusade against drug succeed with our child we will defeat that scourge all over the country

 finally let us stop suppress the spiritual core of our national being our nation could not have be conceive without divine help why be it that we can build a nation with our prayer but we can not use a schoolroom for voluntary prayer the 100th congress of the united states should be remember as the one that end the expulsion of god from america 's classroom

 the quest for excellence into the 21st century begin in the schoolroom but must go next to the workplace more than 20 million new job will be create before the new century unfold and by then our economy should be able to provide a job for everyone who want to work we must also enable our worker to adapt to the rapidly change nature of the workplace and i will propose substantial new federal commitment key to retrain and job mobility

 over the next few week i will be send the congress a complete series of these special message on budget reform welfare reform competitiveness include education trade worker training and assistance agriculture and other subject the congress can give we these tool but to make these tool work it really come down to just be our good and that be the core of american greatness the responsibility of freedom press we towards high knowledge and i believe moral and spiritual greatness through low taxis and small government government have its way of free people 's spirit but only we each of we can let the spirit soar against our own individual standard excellence be what make freedom ring and be not that what we do well

 we be enter our third century now but it be wrong to judge our nation by its year the calendar can not measure america because we be mean to be an endless experiment in freedom with no limit to our reach no boundary to what we can do no end point to our hope the united states constitution be the impassioned and inspire vehicle by which we travel through history it grow out of the most fundamental inspiration of our existence that we be here to serve he by live free that live free release in we the noble of impulse and the good of our ability that we would use these gift for good and generous purpose and would secure they not just for ourselves and for our child but for all mankind

 over the year i will not count if you don't nothing have be so heartwarme to i as speak to america 's young and the little one especially so fresh faced and so eager to know well from time to time i have be with they they will ask about our constitution and i hope you members of congress will not deem this a breach of protocol if you will permit i to share these thought again with the young people who might be listen or watch this evening i have read the constitution of a number of country include the soviet union 's now some people be surprised to hear that they have a constitution and it even supposedly grant a number of freedom to its people many country have write into their constitution provision for freedom of speech and freedom of assembly well if this be true why be the constitution of the united states so exceptional

 well the difference be so small that it almost escape you but it be so great it tell you the whole story in just three word we the people in those other constitution the government tell the people of those country what they be allow to do in our constitution we the people tell the government what it can do and it can do only those thing list in that document and no other virtually every other revolution in history have just exchange one set of ruler for another set of ruler our revolution be the first to say the people be the master and government be their servant and you young people out there do not ever forget that someday you could be in this room but wherever you be america be depend on you to reach your high and be your good because here in america we the people be in charge

 just three word we the people those be the kid on christmas day look out from a frozen sentry post on the 38th parallel in korea or aboard an aircraft carrier in the mediterranean a million mile from home but do their duty

 we the people those be the warmhearte whose number we can not begin to count who will begin the day with a little prayer for hostage they will never know and mia family they will never meet why because that be the way we be this unique breed we call americans

 we the people they're farmer on tough time but who never stop feed a hungry world they be the volunteer at the hospital choke back their tear for the hundredth time care for a baby struggle for life because of a mother who use drug and you will forgive i a special memory it be a million mother like nelle reagan who never know a stranger or turn a hungry person away from her kitchen door

 we the people they refute last week 's television commentary downgrade our optimism and our idealism they be the entrepreneur the builder the pioneer and a lot of regular folk the true hero of our land who make up the most uncommon nation of doer in history you know they be americans because their spirit be as big as the universe and their heart be big than their spirit

 we the people start the third century of a dream and stand up to some cynic who be try to tell we we be not go to get any well be we at the end well i can not tell it any well than the real thing a story record by james madison from the final moment of the constitutional convention september 17th 1787 as the last few member sign the document benjamin franklin the old delegate at 81 year and in frail health look over toward the chair where george washington daily preside at the back of the chair be paint the picture of a sun on the horizon and turn to those sit next to he franklin observe that artist find it difficult in their painting to distinguish between a rise and a set sun

 well i know if we be there we could see those delegate sit around franklin lean in to listen more closely to he and then dr. franklin begin to share his deep hope and fear about the outcome of their effort and this be what he say i have often look at that picture behind the president without be able to tell whether it be a rise or set sun but now at length i have the happiness to know that it be a rise and not a set sun well you can bet it be rise because my fellow citizen america be not finish her good day have just begin

 thank you god bless you and god bless america





my fellow americans
 i have speak to you from this historic office on many occasion and about many thing the power of the presidency be often think to reside within this oval office yet it do not rest here it rest in you the american people and in your trust your trust be what give a president his power of leadership and his personal strength and it be what i want to talk to you about this evening
 for the past three month i have be silent on the revelation about iran and you must have be think well why do not he tell we what be happen why do not he just speak to we as he have in the past when we have face trouble or tragedy other of you i guess be think what be he do hide out in the white house well the reason i have not speak to you before now be this you deserve the truth and as frustrating as the waiting have be i feel it be improper to come to you with sketchy report or possibly even erroneous statement which would then have to be correct create even more doubt and confusion there be be enough of that i have pay a price for my silence in term of your trust and confidence but i have have to wait as you have for the complete story that be why i appoint ambassador david abshire as my special counsellor to help get out the thousand of document to the various investigation and i appoint a special review board the tower board which take on the chore of pull the truth together for i and get to the bottom of thing it have now issue its finding
 i be often accuse of be an optimist and it be true i have to hunt pretty hard to find any good news in the board 's report as you know it be well stock with criticism which i will discuss in a moment but i be very relieved to read this sentence the board be convince that the president do indeed want the full story to be tell and that will continue to be my pledge to you as the other investigation go forward i want to thank the member of the panel former senator john tower former secretary of state edmund muskie and former national security adviser brent scowcroft they have do the nation as well as i personally a great service by submit a report of such integrity and depth they have my genuine and enduring gratitude
 i have study the board 's report its finding be honest convincing and highly critical and i accept they and tonight i want to share with you my thought on these finding and report to you on the action i be take to implement the board 's recommendation first let i say i take full responsibility for my own action and for those of my administration as angry as i may be about activity undertake without my knowledge i be still accountable for those activity as disappointed as i may be in some who serve i i be still the one who must answer to the american people for this behavior and as personally distasteful as i find secret bank account and divert fund well as the navy would say this happen on my watch
 let us start with the part that be the most controversial a few month ago i tell the american people i do not trade arm for hostage my heart and my good intention still tell i that be true but the fact and the evidence tell i it be not as the tower board report what begin as a strategic opening to iran deteriorate in its implementation into trading arm for hostage this run counter to my own belief to administration policy and to the original strategy we have in mind there be reason why it happen but no excuse it be a mistake i undertake the original iran initiative in order to develop relation with those who might assume leadership in a post khomeini government
 it be clear from the board 's report however that i let my personal concern for the hostage spill over into the geopolitical strategy of reach out to iran i ask so many question about the hostage welfare that i do not ask enough about the specific of the total iran plan let i say to the hostage family we have not give up we never will and i promise you we will use every legitimate mean to free your love one from captivity but i must also caution that those americans who freely remain in such dangerous area must know that they be responsible for their own safety
 now another major aspect of the board 's finding regard the transfer of fund to the nicaraguan contra the tower board be not able to find out what happen to this money so the fact here will be leave to the continue investigation of the court appoint independent counsel and the two congressional investigate committee i be confident the truth will come out about this matter as well as i tell the tower board i do not know about any diversion of fund to the contra but as president i can not escape responsibility
 much have be say about my management style a style that be work successfully for i during 8 year as governor of california and for most of my presidency the way i work be to identify the problem find the right individual to do the job and then let they go to it i have find this invariably bring out the good in people they seem to rise to their full capability and in the long run you get more do when it come to manage the nsc staff let us face it my style do not match its previous track record i have already begin correct this as a start yesterday i meet with the entire professional staff of the national security council i define for they the value i want to guide the national security policy of this country i tell they that i want a policy that be as justifiable and understandable in public as it be in secret i want a policy that reflect the will of the congress as well as of the white house and i tell they that there will be no more freelancing by individual when it come to our national security
 you have hear a lot about the staff of the national security council in recent month well i can tell you they be good and dedicated government employee who put in long hour for the nation 's benefit they be eager and anxious to serve their country one thing still upset i however be that no one keep proper record of meeting or decision this lead to my failure to recollect whether i approve an arm shipment before or after the fact i do approve it i just can not say specifically when well rest assure there be plenty of recordkeeping now go on at 1600 pennsylvania avenue
 for nearly a week now i have be study the board 's report i want the american people to know that this wrench ordeal of recent month have not be in vain i endorse every one of the tower board 's recommendation in fact i be go beyond its recommendation so as to put the house in even well order i be take action in three basic area personnel national security policy and the process for make sure that the system work
 first personnel i've bring in an accomplished and highly respected new team here at the white house they bring new blood new energy and new credibility and experience former senator howard baker my new chief of staff possess a breadth of legislative and foreign affair skill that be impossible to match i be hopeful that his experience as minority and majority leader of the senate can help we forge a new partnership with the congress especially on foreign and national security policy i be genuinely honor that he be give up his own presidential aspiration to serve the country as my chief of staff frank carlucci my new national security adviser be respect for his experience in government and trust for his judgment and counsel under he the nsc staff be be rebuild with proper management discipline already almost half the nsc professional staff be comprise of new people
 yesterday i nominate william webster a man of sterling reputation to be director of the central intelligence agency mr. webster have serve as director of the fbi and as a u.s. district court judge he understand the meaning of rule of law so that his knowledge of national security matter can be available to i on a continue basis i will also appoint john tower to serve as a member of my foreign intelligence advisory board i be consider other change in personnel and i will move more furniture as i see fit in the week and month ahead
 second in the area of national security policy i have order the nsc to begin a comprehensive review of all covert operation i have also direct that any covert activity be in support of clear policy objective and in compliance with american value i expect a covert policy that if americans see it on the front page of their newspaper they would say that make sense i have have issue a directive prohibit the nsc staff itself from undertake covert operation no if and or but i have ask vice president bush to reconvene his task force on terrorism to review our terrorist policy in light of the event that have occur
 third in term of the process of reach national security decision i be adopt in total the tower report 's model of how the nsc process and staff should work i be direct mr. carlucci to take the necessary step to make that happen he will report back to i on further reform that might be need i have create the post of nsc legal adviser to assure a great sensitivity to matter of law i be also determined to make the congressional oversight process work proper procedure for consultation with the congress will be follow not only in letter but in spirit before the end of march i will report to the congress on all the step i have take in line with the tower board 's conclusion
 now what should happen when you make a mistake be this you take your knock you learn your lesson and then you move on that be the healthy way to deal with a problem this in no way diminish the importance of the other continue investigation but the business of our country and our people must proceed i have get this message from republicans and democrats in congress from ally around the world and if we be read the signal right even from the soviets and of course i have hear the message from you the american people you know by the time you reach my age you have make plenty of mistake and if you have live your life properly so you learn you put thing in perspective you pull your energy together you change you go forward
 my fellow americans i have a great deal that i want to accomplish with you and for you over the next two year and the lord willing that be exactly what i intend to do
 good night and god bless you

thank you very much chancellor kohl govern mayor diepgen lady and gentleman twenty four year ago president john f. kennedy visit berlin speak to the people of this city and the world at the city hall well since then two other president have come each in his turn to berlin and today i myself make my second visit to your city

 we come to berlin we american presidents because it be our duty to speak in this place of freedom but i must confess we be draw here by other thing as well by the feeling of history in this city more than 500 year old than our own nation by the beauty of the grunewald and the tiergarten most of all by your courage and determination perhaps the composer paul lincke understand something about american president you see like so many president before i i come here today because wherever i go whatever i do ich hab noch einen koffer in berlin i still have a suitcase in berlin

 our gathering today be be broadcast throughout western europe and north america i understand that it be be see and hear as well in the east to those listen throughout eastern europe i extend my warm greeting and the good will of the american people to those listen in east berlin a special word although i can not be with you i address my remark to you just as surely as to those stand here before i for i join you as i join your fellow countryman in the west in this firm this unalterable belief es gibt nur ein berlin there be only one berlin

 behind i stand a wall that encircle the free sector of this city part of a vast system of barrier that divide the entire continent of europe from the baltic south those barrier cut across germany in a gash of barbed wire concrete dog run and guardtower far south there may be no visible no obvious wall but there remain armed guard and checkpoint all the same still a restriction on the right to travel still an instrument to impose upon ordinary man and woman the will of a totalitarian state yet it be here in berlin where the wall emerge most clearly here cut across your city where the news photo and the television screen have imprint this brutal division of a continent upon the mind of the world stand before the brandenburg gate every man be a german separate from his fellow man every man be a berliner force to look upon a scar

 president von weizsacker have say the german question be open as long as the brandenburg gate be close today i say as long as this gate be closed as long as this scar of a wall be permit to stand it be not the german question alone that remain open but the question of freedom for all mankind yet i do not come here to lament for i find in berlin a message of hope even in the shadow of this wall a message of triumph

 in this season of spring in 1945 the people of berlin emerge from their air raid shelter to find devastation thousand of mile away the people of the united states reach out to help and in 1947 secretary of state as you have be tell george marshall announce the creation of what would become know as the marshall plan speak precisely 40 year ago this month he say our policy be direct not against any country or doctrine but against hunger poverty desperation and chaos

 in the reichstag a few moment ago i see a display commemorate this 40th anniversary of the marshall plan i be strike by the sign on a burn out gutte structure that be be rebuild i understand that berliners of my own generation can remember see sign like it dot throughout the western sector of the city the sign read simply the marshall plan be help here to strengthen the free world a strong free world in the west that dream become real japan rise from ruin to become an economic giant italy france belgium virtually every nation in western europe see political and economic rebirth the european community be found

 in west germany and here in berlin there take place an economic miracle the wirtschaftswunder adenauer erhard reuter and other leader understand the practical importance of liberty that just as truth can flourish only when the journalist be give freedom of speech so prosperity can come about only when the farmer and businessman enjoy economic freedom the german leader reduce tariff expand free trade lower taxis from 1950 to 1960 alone the standard of living in west germany and berlin double

 where four decade ago there be rubble today in west berlin there be the great industrial output of any city in germany busy office block fine home and apartment proud avenue and the spread lawn of park land where a city 's culture seem to have be destroy today there be two great university orchestra and an opera countless theater and museum where there be want today there be abundance food clothing automobile the wonderful good of the ku'damm from devastation from utter ruin you berliner have in freedom rebuild a city that once again rank as one of the great on earth the soviets may have have other plan but my friend there be a few thing the soviets do not count on berliner herz berliner humor ja und berliner schnauze berliner heart berliner humor yes and a berliner schnauze laughter

 in the 1950 khrushchev predict we will bury you but in the west today we see a free world that have achieve a level of prosperity and well be unprecedented in all human history in the communist world we see failure technological backwardness decline standard of health even want of the most basic kind too little food even today the soviet union still can not feed itself after these four decade then there stand before the entire world one great and inescapable conclusion freedom lead to prosperity freedom replace the ancient hatred among the nation with comity and peace freedom be the victor

 and now the soviets themselves may in a limited way be come to understand the importance of freedom we hear much from moscow about a new policy of reform and openness some political prisoner have be release certain foreign news broadcast be no long be jam some economic enterprise have be permit to operate with great freedom from state control be these the beginning of profound change in the soviet state or be they token gesture intend to raise false hope in the west or to strengthen the soviet system without change it we welcome change and openness for we believe that freedom and security go together that the advance of human liberty can only strengthen the cause of world peace

 there be one sign the soviets can make that would be unmistakable that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace general secretary gorbachev if you seek peace if you seek prosperity for the soviet union and eastern europe if you seek liberalization come here to this gate mr. gorbachev open this gate mr. gorbachev tear down this wall

 i understand the fear of war and the pain of division that afflict this continent and i pledge to you my country 's effort to help overcome these burden to be sure we in the west must resist soviet expansion so we must maintain defense of unassailable strength yet we seek peace so we must strive to reduce arm on both side begin 10 year ago the soviets challenge the western alliance with a grave new threat hundred of new and more deadly ss-20 nuclear missile capable of strike every capital in europe the western alliance respond by commit itself to a counterdeployment unless the soviets agree to negotiate a well solution namely the elimination of such weapon on both side for many month the soviets refuse to bargain in earnestness as the alliance in turn prepare to go forward with its counterdeployment there be difficult day day of protest like those during my 1982 visit to this city and the soviets later walk away from the table

 but through it all the alliance hold firm and i invite those who protest then i invite those who protest today to mark this fact because we remain strong the soviets come back to the table and because we remain strong today we have within reach the possibility not merely of limit the growth of arm but of eliminate for the first time an entire class of nuclear weapon from the face of the earth as i speak nato minister be meet in iceland to review the progress of our proposal for eliminate these weapon at the talk in geneva we have also propose deep cut in strategic offensive weapon and the western ally have likewise make far reach proposal to reduce the danger of conventional war and to place a total ban on chemical weapon

 while we pursue these arm reduction i pledge to you that we will maintain the capacity to deter soviet aggression at any level at which it might occur and in cooperation with many of our ally the united states be pursue the strategic defense initiative research to base deterrence not on the threat of offensive retaliation but on defense that truly defend on system in short that will not target population but shield they by these mean we seek to increase the safety of europe and all the world but we must remember a crucial fact east and west do not mistrust each other because we be arm we be armed because we mistrust each other and our difference be not about weapon but about liberty when president kennedy speak at the city hall those 24 year ago freedom be encircle berlin be under siege and today despite all the pressure upon this city berlin stand secure in its liberty and freedom itself be transform the globe

 in the philippines in south and central america democracy have be give a rebirth throughout the pacific free market be work miracle after miracle of economic growth in the industrialized nation a technological revolution be take place a revolution mark by rapid dramatic advance in computer and telecommunication

 in europe only one nation and those it control refuse to join the community of freedom yet in this age of redouble economic growth of information and innovation the soviet union face a choice it must make fundamental change or it will become obsolete today thus represent a moment of hope we in the west stand ready to cooperate with the east to promote true openness to break down barrier that separate people to create a safe free world

 and surely there be no well place than berlin the meeting place of east and west to make a start free people of berlin today as in the past the united states stand for the strict observance and full implementation of all part of the four power agreement of 1971 let we use this occasion the 750th anniversary of this city to usher in a new era to seek a still full rich life for the berlin of the future together let we maintain and develop the tie between the federal republic and the western sector of berlin which be permit by the 1971 agreement

 and i invite mr. gorbachev let we work to bring the eastern and western part of the city close together so that all the inhabitant of all berlin can enjoy the benefit that come with life in one of the great city of the world to open berlin still far to all europe east and west let we expand the vital air access to this city find way of make commercial air service to berlin more convenient more comfortable and more economical we look to the day when west berlin can become one of the chief aviation hub in all central europe

 with our french and british partner the united states be prepared to help bring international meeting to berlin it would be only fitting for berlin to serve as the site of united nations meeting or world conference on human right and arm control or other issue that call for international cooperation there be no well way to establish hope for the future than to enlighten young mind and we would be honor to sponsor summer youth exchange cultural event and other program for young berliners from the east our french and british friend i be certain will do the same and it be my hope that an authority can be find in east berlin to sponsor visit from young people of the western sector

 one final proposal one close to my heart sport represent a source of enjoyment and ennoblement and you many have note that the republic of korea south korea have offer to permit certain event of the 1988 olympics to take place in the north international sport competition of all kind could take place in both part of this city and what well way to demonstrate to the world the openness of this city than to offer in some future year to hold the olympic game here in berlin east and west

 in these four decade as i have say you berliner have build a great city you have do so in spite of threat the soviet attempt to impose the east mark the blockade today the city thrive in spite of the challenge implicit in the very presence of this wall what keep you here certainly there be a great deal to be say for your fortitude for your defiant courage but i believe there be something deep something that involve berlin 's whole look and feel and way of life not mere sentiment no one could live long in berlin without be completely disabused of illusion something instead that have see the difficulty of life in berlin but choose to accept they that continue to build this good and proud city in contrast to a surround totalitarian presence that refuse to release human energy or aspiration something that speak with a powerful voice of affirmation that say yes to this city yes to the future yes to freedom in a word i would submit that what keep you in berlin be love love both profound and abide

 perhaps this get to the root of the matter to the most fundamental distinction of all between east and west the totalitarian world produce backwardness because it do such violence to the spirit thwart the human impulse to create to enjoy to worship the totalitarian world find even symbol of love and of worship an affront year ago before the east germans begin rebuild their church they erect a secular structure the television tower at alexander platz virtually ever since the authority have be work to correct what they view as the tower 's one major flaw treat the glass sphere at the top with paint and chemical of every kind yet even today when the sun strike that sphere that sphere that tower over all berlin the light make the sign of the cross there in berlin like the city itself symbol of love symbol of worship can not be suppress

 as i look out a moment ago from the reichstag that embodiment of german unity i notice word crudely spray paint upon the wall perhaps by a young berliner this wall will fall belief become reality yes across europe this wall will fall for it can not withstand faith it can not withstand truth the wall can not withstand freedom

 and i would like before i close to say one word i have read and i have be question since i have be here about certain demonstration against my coming and i would like to say just one thing and to those who demonstrate so i wonder if they have ever ask themselves that if they should have the kind of government they apparently seek no one would ever be able to do what they be do again

 thank you and god bless you all



the president thank you all very much welcome to the white house this ceremony and the treaty we be sign today be both excellent example of the reward of patience it be over 6 year ago november 18 1981 that i first propose what would come to be call the zero option it be a simple proposal one might say disarmingly simple unlike treaty in the past it do not simply codify the status quo or a new arm buildup it do not simply talk of control an arm race

 for the first time in history the language of arm control be replace by arm reduction"—in this case the complete elimination of an entire class of u.s. and soviet nuclear missile of course this require a dramatic shift in thinking and it take conventional wisdom some time to catch up reaction to say the least be mixed to some the zero option be impossibly visionary and unrealistic to other merely a propaganda ploy well with patience determination and commitment we have make this impossible vision a reality

 general secretary gorbachev i be sure you be familiar with ivan krylov 's famous tale about the swan the crawfish and the pike it seem that once upon a time these three be try to move a wagonload together they hitch and harness themselves to the wagon it be not very heavy but no matter how hard they work the wagon just would not move you see the swan be fly upward the crawfish keep crawl backward the pike keep make for the water the end result be that they get nowhere and the wagon be still there to this day well strong and fundamental moral difference continue to exist between our nation but today on this vital issue at least we have see what can be accomplish when we pull together

 the number alone demonstrate the value of this agreement on the soviet side over 1,500 deploy warhead will be remove and all ground launch intermediate range missile include the ss-20 's will be destroy on our side our entire complement of pershing ii and ground launch cruise missile with some 400 deploy warhead will all be destroy additional backup missile on both side will also be destroy

 but the importance of this treaty transcend number we have listen to the wisdom in an old russian maxim and i be sure you be familiar with it mr. general secretary though my pronunciation may give you difficulty the maxim be dovorey no provorey trust but verify

 the general secretary you repeat that at every meeting

 the president i like it

 this agreement contain the most stringent verification regime in history include provision for inspection team actually reside in each other 's territory and several other form of on site inspection as well this treaty protect the interest of america 's friend and ally it also embody another important principle the need for glasnost a great openness in military program and force

 we can only hope that this history make agreement will not be an end in itself but the beginning of a work relationship that will enable we to tackle the other urgent issue before we strategic offensive nuclear weapon the balance of conventional force in europe the destructive and tragic regional conflict that beset so many part of our globe and respect for the human and natural right god have grant to all man

 to all here who have work so hard to make this vision a reality thank you and congratulation above all to ambassadors glitman and obukhov to quote another russian proverb as you can see i be become quite an expert in russian proverb the harvest come more from sweat than from the dew

 so i be go to propose to general secretary gorbachev that we issue one last instruction to you get some well deserve rest

 the general secretary we be not go to do that

 the president well now mr. general secretary would you like to say a few word before we sign the treaty

 the general secretary mr. president lady and gentleman comrade succeed generation will hand down their verdict on the importance of the event which we be about to witness but i will venture to say that what we be go to do the signing of the first ever agreement eliminate nuclear weapon have a universal significance for mankind both from the standpoint of world politic and from the standpoint of humanism

 for everyone and above all for our two great power the treaty whose text be on this table offer a big chance at last to get onto the road lead away from the threat of catastrophe it be our duty to take full advantage of that chance and move together toward a nuclear free world which hold out for our child and grandchild and for their child and grandchild the promise of a fulfilling and happy life without fear and without a senseless waste of resource on weapon of destruction

 we can he proud of plant this sapling which may one day grow into a mighty tree of peace but it be probably still too early to bestow laurel upon each other as the great american poet and philosopher ralph waldo emerson say the reward of a thing well do be to have do it

 so let we reward ourselves by get down to business we have cover a 7 year long road replete with intense work and debate one last step towards this table and the treaty will be sign

 may december 8 1987 become a date that will be inscribe in the history book a date that will mark the watershed separate the era of a mount risk of nuclear war from the era of a demilitarization of human life





good evening as i be speak to you now general secretary gorbachev be leave on his return trip to the soviet union his departure mark the end of three historic day here in washington in which mr. gorbachev and i continue to build a foundation for well relation between our government and our people during these three day we take a step only a first step but still a critical one toward build a more durable peace indeed a step that may be the most important take since world war ii to slow down the arm buildup

 i be refer to the treaty that we sign tuesday afternoon in the east room of the white house i believe this treaty represent a landmark in postwar history because it be not just an arm control but an arm reduction agreement unlike treaty of the past this agreement do not simply establish ceiling for new weapon it actually reduce the number of such weapon in fact it altogether abolish an entire class of u.s. and soviet nuclear missile

 the verification measure in this treaty be also something new with far reach implication on site inspection and short notice inspection will be permit within the soviet union again this be a first time event a breakthrough and that be why i believe this treaty will not only lessen the threat of war it can also speed along a process that may someday remove that threat entirely

 indeed this treaty and all that we have achieve during this summit signal a broad understanding between the united states and the soviet union it be an understanding that will help keep the peace as we work toward the ultimate goal of our foreign policy a world where the people of every land can decide for themselves their form of government and way of life

 yet as important as the inf treaty be there be a further and even more crucial point about the last three day and the entire summit process soviet american relation be no long focus only on arm control issue they now cover a far broad agenda one that have at its root realism and candor let i explain this with a saying i have often repeat nation do not distrust each other because they be arm they be armed because they distrust each other and just as real peace mean the presence of freedom and justice as well as the absence of war so too summit must be discussion not just about arm but about the fundamental difference that cause nation to be arm

 deal then with the deep source of conflict between nation and system of government be a practical and moral imperative and that be why it be vital to establish a broad summit agenda one that deal not only with arm reduction but also people to people contact between our nation and most important the issue of human right and regional conflict

 this be the summit agenda we have adopt by do so we have deal not just with arm control issue but also with fundamental problem such as soviet expansionism human right violation as well as our own moral opposition to the ideology that justify such practice in this way we have put soviet american relation on a far more candid and far more realistic footing it also mean that while there be movement indeed dramatic movement in the arm reduction area much remain to be do in that area as well as in these other critical area that i have mention especially and this go without say in advance our goal of a world open to the expansion of human freedom and the growth of democratic government

 so much work lie ahead let i explain on the matter of regional conflict i speak candidly with mr. gorbachev on the issue of afghanistan iran iraq cambodia angola and nicaragua i continue to have high hope and he assure i that he do too that we can have real cooperation in resolve regional conflict on term that promote peace and freedom this be essential to a last improvement in our relation

 so too on human right there be some very limited movement resolution of a number of individual ease in which prisoner will be release or exit visa grant there be assurance of future more substantial movement which we hope to see become a reality

 and finally with regard to the last item on our agenda scientific educational cultural and economic exchange we agree to expand cooperation in way that will break down some of the artificial barrier between our nation for example agreement be reach to expand and improve civil air service between our two country

 but let i point out here that while much work be ahead of we the progress we have make especially in arm reduction do reflect a well understanding between ourselves and the soviets it also reflect something deep you see since my first meeting with general secretary gorbachev in 1985 i have always regard you the american people as full participant in our discussion though it may surprise mr. gorbachev to discover that all this time there have be a third party in the room with we i do firmly believe the principal credit for the patience and persistence that bring success this year belong to you the american people

 your support over these last seven year have lay the basis for these negotiation your support make it possible for we to rebuild our military strength to liberate grenada to strike hard against terrorism in libya and more recently to protect our strategic interest and bolster our friend in the persian gulf your support make possible our policy of help freedom fighter like those in afghanistan nicaragua angola cambodia and other place around the globe and when last year at reykjavik i refuse soviet demand that we trade away sdi our strategic defense initiative that could erect a space shield against ballistic missile your overwhelming support make it clear to the soviet leader that the american people prefer no deal to a bad deal and will back their president on matter of national security

 in short your support for our foreign policy goal build a safe peace as we advance the cause of world freedom have help bring the soviets to the bargaining table it make it possible now to hope for a real fundamental improvement in our relation

 you know the question have often be ask whether democratic leader who be accountable to their people be not at a grave disadvantage in negotiate with leader of totalitarian states who bear no such burden well believe i i think i can answer that question i can speak from personal experience over the long run no leader at the bargaining table can enjoy any great advantage than the knowledge that he have behind he a people who be strong and free and alert and resolve to remain that way people like you and it be this kind of informed and enlightened support this hide strength of democratic government that enable we to do what we do this week at the washington summit

 now that the treaty 's be sign it will be submit to the senate for the next step the ratification process i will meet with the leadership of congress here tomorrow morning and i be confident that the senate will now act in an expeditious way to fulfill its duty under our constitution

 to this end let i explain the background in the mid- and late-1970 's the soviets begin to deploy hundred of new mobile intermediate range missile capable of destroy major city and military installation in europe and asia this action be an unprovoked new dimension of the threat against our friend and ally on both continent a new threat to which the democratic nation have no comparable counter

 despite intense pressure from the soviets nato proceed with what we call a two track policy first we would deploy a limited number of our own inf missile as a deterrent but at the same time push hard in negotiation to do away with this entirely new nuclear threat and we set out to do this with a formula i first put forward in 1981 it be call the zero option it mean the complete elimination of these missile on both side well at first many call this a mere propaganda ploy some even here in this country but we be persistent our ally steadfast and eventually the soviets return to the bargaining table the result be our inf treaty

 as you see from the map on the screen now the soviet missile which will be remove and eliminate under the treaty have be a major threat to the security of our friend and ally on two continent europe and asia under the term of this treaty we will be eliminate 400 deploy warhead while the soviet union eliminate 1,600 or four time as many now let i also point out that this do not however leave nato unprotected in fact we will maintain a substantial deterrent force on the ground in the air and at sea our commitment to nato 's strategy of be able to respond as necessary to any form of aggression remain steadfast

 and with regard to verification as i have mention we have the breakthrough of on site inspection and short notice inspection not only at potential missile deployment site but at the facility where the soviet ss-20 missile and their component have be assemble we have a verification procedure that assure each side that the missile of the other side have be destroy and that new one be not build

 here then be a treaty that show how persistence and consistency eventually can pay off in arm negotiation and let i assure you too that this treaty have be accomplish with unprecedented consultation with our ally and friend i have speak personally with the leader of the major democracy as have secretary shultz and our diplomat this treaty have full allied support but if persistence be pay off in our arm reduction effort the question of human right and regional conflict be still problem in our relation but i be pleased that some progress have be make in these area also

 now in addition to these candid exchange on our four part agenda mr. gorbachev and i do do some important planning for a moscow summit next year we agree that we must redouble our effort to reach agreement on reduce the level of u.s. and soviet long range or strategic nuclear arm as i have propose in the start negotiation he and i make real progress toward our goal first agree to at geneva to achieve deep 50 percent cut in our arsenal of those powerful weapon we agree that we should build on our effort to achieve agreement on a start treaty at the early possible date and we have instruct our delegation in geneva accordingly

 now i believe deep reduction in these offensive weapon along with the development of sdi would do much to make the world safe for that reason i make it clear that our sdi program will continue and that when we have a defense ready to deploy we will do so

 about the future mr. gorbachev and i also agree that as nuclear weapon be reduce it become all the more important to redress the disparity in conventional and chemical weapon where the soviets now enjoy significant advantage over the united states and our ally i think then from all of this you can see not only the direction of soviet american relation but the large framework of american foreign policy as i tell the british parliament in 1982 we seek to rid the world of the two great nightmare of the postwar era the threat of nuclear war and the threat of totalitarianism

 and that be why by pursue sdi which be a defense against offensive missile and by go for arm reduction rather than just arm control we be move away from the so call policy of mutual assure destruction by which nation hold each other hostage to nuclear terror and destruction so too we be say that the postwar policy of containment be no long enough that the goal of american foreign policy be both world peace and world freedom that as a people we hope and will work for a day when all of god 's child will enjoy the human dignity that their creator intend i believe we gain some ground with regard to that cause in these last few day

 since my first day in office i have argue that the future belong not to repressive or totalitarian way of life but to the cause of freedom freedom of the marketplace freedom to speak assemble and vote and when we see the progress of democracy in these last year from latin america to asia we must be optimistic about the future of our child

 when we be together in iceland mr. gorbachev tell i that this sort of talk be sometimes view in the soviet union as a threat but i tell he then and i have say since then that this be no threat at all but only a dream the american dream and it be a dream that have mean so much to so many a dream that still shine out to the world

 you know a couple of year ago nancy and i be deeply move by a story tell by former new york times reporter and greek immigrant nicholas gage it be the story of eleni his mother a woman catch in one of the terrible struggle of the postwar era the greek civil war at the end of world war ii a mother who be try and execute because she smuggle her child out to safety in america

 it be also the story of how her son secretly vow to return to greece someday to take vengeance on the man who have send his mother to her death but at the end of the story nicholas gage find he can not extract the vengeance he promise himself mr. gage write it would have relieve the pain that have fill he for so many year but it would also have break the one bridge still connect he to his mother that part of he most like she as he tell it and her final cry be not a curse on her killer but an invocation of what she have die for a declaration of love these simple last word of mr. gage 's mother of eleni be my child

 how that cry echo down through the century a cry for all child of the world a cry for peace for a world of love and understanding and it be the hope of heed such word the call for freedom and peace speak by a choose people in a promise land the call speak by the nazar carpenter nazarene carpenter i should say stand at the sea of galilee the carpenter whose birth into the poverty of a stable we celebrate it be these word that we remember as the holiday season approach and we reflect on the event of this week here in washington

 so let we remember the child and the future we want for they and let we never forget that this promise of peace and freedom the gift that be ours as americans the gift that we seek to share with all the world depend for its strength on the spiritual source from which it come so during this holy season let we also reflect that in the prayer of simple people there be more power and might than that possess by all the great statesman or army of the earth let we then thank god for all his blessing to this nation and ask he for his help and guidance so that we might continue the work of peace and foster the hope of a world where human freedom be enshrine

 to sum up then this summit be a clear success we make progress on each item in our four part agenda mr. gorbachev and i have agree to meet in several month in moscow to continue what we have achieve during these past three day i believe there be reason for both hope and optimism





mr. speaker mr. president and distinguish member of the house and senate

 when we first meet here seven year ago many of we for the first time it be with the hope of begin something new for america we meet here tonight in this historic chamber to continue that work if anyone expect just a proud recitation of the accomplishment of my administration i say let us leave that to history we be not finish yet so my message to you tonight be put on your work shoe we be still on the job

 history record the power of the idea that bring we here those 7 year ago idea like the individual 's right to reach as far and as high as his or her talent will permit the free market as an engine of economic progress and as an ancient chinese philosopher lao tzu say govern a great nation as you would cook a small fish do not overdo it well these idea be part of a large notion a vision if you will of america herself an america not only rich in opportunity for the individual but an america too of strong family and vibrant neighborhood an america whose divergent but harmonize community be a reflection of a deep community of value the value of work of family of religion and of the love of freedom that god place in each of we and whose defense he have entrust in a special way to this nation

 all of this be make possible by an idea i speak of when mr. gorbachev be here the belief that the most exciting revolution ever know to humankind begin with three simple word we the people the revolutionary notion that the people grant government its right and not the other way around and there be one lesson that have come home powerfully to i which i would offer to you now just as those who create this republic pledge to each other their life their fortune and their sacred honor so too america 's leader today must pledge to each other that we will keep foremost in our heart and mind not what be good for ourselves or for our party but what be good for america

 in the spirit of jefferson let we affirm that in this chamber tonight there be no republicans no democrats just americans yes we will have our difference but let we always remember what unite we far outweighs whatever divide we those who send we here to serve they the million of americans watch and listen tonight expect this of we let us prove to they and to ourselves that democracy work even in an election year we have do this before and as we have work together to bring down spending tax rate and inflation employment have climb to record height america have create more job and well higher pay job family income have rise for 4 straight year and america 's poor climb out of poverty at the fast rate in more than 10 year

 our record be not just the long peacetime expansion in history but an economic and social revolution of hope base on work incentive growth and opportunity a revolution of compassion that lead to private sector initiative and a 77 percent increase in charitable giving a revolution that at a critical moment in world history reclaim and restore the american dream

 in international relation too there be only one description for what together we have achieve a complete turnabout a revolution seven year ago america be weak and freedom everywhere be under siege today america be strong and democracy be everywhere on the move from central america to east asia idea like free market and democratic reform and human right be take hold we have replace blame america with look up to america we have rebuild our defense and of all our accomplishment none can give we more satisfaction than know that our young people be again proud to wear our country 's uniform

 and in a few moment i be go to talk about three development arm reduction the strategic defense initiative and the global democratic revolution that when take together offer a chance none of we would have dare imagine 7 year ago a chance to rid the world of the two great nightmare of the postwar era i speak of the startling hope of give our child a future free of both totalitarianism and nuclear terror

 tonight then we be strong prosperous at peace and we be free this be the state of our union and if we will work together this year i believe we can give a future president and a future congress the chance to make that prosperity that peace that freedom not just the state of our union but the state of our world

 toward this end we have four basic objective tonight first step we can take this year to keep our economy strong and grow to give our child a future of low inflation and full employment second let us check our progress in attack social problem where important gain have be make but which still need critical attention i mean school that work economic independence for the poor restore respect for family life and family value our third objective tonight be global continue the exciting economic and democratic revolution we have see around the world fourth and finally our nation have remain at peace for nearly a decade and a half as we move toward our goal of world prosperity and world freedom we must protect that peace and deter war by make sure the next president inherit what you and i have a moral obligation to give that president a national security that be unassailable and a national defense that take full advantage of new technology and be fully fund

 this be a full agenda it be mean to be you see my thinking on the next year be quite simple let us make this the good of 8 and that mean it be all out right to the finish line i do not buy the idea that this be the last year of anything because we be not talk here tonight about register temporary gain but way of make permanent our success and that be why our focus be the value the principle and idea that make america great let us be clear on this point we be for limited government because we understand as the founding fathers do that it be the good way of ensure personal liberty and empower the individual so that every american of every race and region share fully in the flowering of american prosperity and freedom

 one other thing we americans like the future like the sound of it the idea of it the hope of it where other fear trade and economic growth we see opportunity for create new wealth and undreame of opportunity for million in our own land and beyond where other seek to throw up barrier we seek to bring they down where other take counsel of their fear we follow our hope yes we americans like the future and like make the most of it let us do that now

 and let us begin by discuss how to maintain economic growth by control and eventually eliminate the problem of federal deficit we have have a balanced budget only eight time in the last 57 year for the first time in 14 year the federal government spend less in real term last year than the year before we take $ 73 billion off last year 's deficit compare to the year before the deficit itself have move from 6.3 percent of the gross national product to only 3.4 percent and perhaps the most important sign of progress have be the change in our view of deficit you know a few of we can remember when not too many year ago those who create the deficit say they would make we prosperous and not to worry about the debt because we owe it to ourselves well at last there be agreement that we can not spend ourselves rich

 our recent budget agreement design to reduce federal deficit by $ 76 billion over the next 2 year build on this consensus but this agreement must be adhere to without slip into the error of the past more broken promise and more unchecked spending as i indicate in my first state of the union what ail we can be simply put the federal government be too big and it spend too much money i can assure you the bipartisan leadership of congress of my help in fight off any attempt to bust our budget agreement and this include the swift and certain use of the veto power

 now it be also time for some plain talk about the most immediate obstacle to control federal deficit the simple but frustrating problem of make expense match revenue something american family do and the federal government can't have cause crisis after crisis in this city mr. speaker mr. president i will say to you tonight what i have say before and will continue to say the budget process have break down it need a drastic overhaul with each ensue year the spectacle before the american people be the same as it be this christmas budget deadline delay or miss completely monstrous continue resolution that pack hundred of billion of dollar worth of spend into one bill and a federal government on the brink of default

 i know i be echo what you here in the congress have say because you suffer so directly but let us recall that in 7 year of 91 appropriation bill schedule to arrive on my desk by a certain date only 10 make it on time last year of the 13 appropriation bill due by october 1st none of they make it instead we have four continue resolution last 41 day then 36 day and 2 day and 3 day respectively

 and then along come these behemoth this be the conference report—1,053 page report weigh 14 pound then this a reconciliation bill 6 month late that be 1,186 page long weigh 15 pound and the long term continue resolution this one be 2 month late and it be 1,057 page long weigh 14 pound that be a total of 43 pound of paper and ink you have 3 hour yes 3 hour to consider each and it take 300 people at my office of management and budget just to read the bill so the government would not shut down congress should not send another one of these no and if you do i will not sign it

 let us change all this instead of a presidential budget that get discard and a congressional budget resolution that be not enforce why not a simple partnership a joint agreement that set out the spending priority within the available revenue and let us remember our deadline be october 1st not christmas let us get the people 's work do in time to avoid a footrace with santa claus laughter and yes this year to coin a phrase a new beginning 13 individual bill on time and fully review by congress

 i be also certain you join i in say let us help ensure our future of prosperity by give the president a tool that though i will not get to use it be one i know future president of either party must have give the president the same authority that 43 governor use in their states the right to reach into massive appropriation bill pare away the waste and enforce budget discipline let us approve the line item veto

 and let us take a partial step in this direction most of you in this chamber do not know what be in this catchall bill and report over the past few week we have all learn what be tuck away behind a little comma here and there for example there be million for item such as cranberry research blueberry research the study of crawfish and the commercialization of wildflower and that be not to mention the five or so million $ .5 million that so that people from develop nation could come here to watch congress at work laughter i will not even touch that laughter so tonight i offer you this challenge in 30 day i will send back to you those item as rescission which if i have the authority to line they out i would do so

 now review this multibillion dollar package that will not undercut our bipartisan budget agreement as a matter of fact if adopt it will improve our deficit reduction goal and what an example we can set that we be serious about get our financial account in order by act and approve this plan you have the opportunity to override a congressional process that be out of control

 there be another vital reform yes gramm rudman hollings have be profoundly helpful but let we take its goal of a balanced budget and make it permanent let we do now what so many state do to hold down spending and what 32 state legislature have ask we to do let we heed the wish of an overwhelming plurality of americans and pass a constitutional amendment that mandate a balanced budget and force the federal government to live within its mean reform of the budget process include the line item veto and balanced budget amendment will together with real restraint on government spending prevent the federal budget from ever again ravage the family budget

 let us ensure that the federal government never again legislate against the family and the home last september i sign an executive order on the family require that every department and agency review its activity in light of seven standard design to promote and not harm the family but let we make certain that the family be always at the center of the public policy process not just in this administration but in all future administration it be time for congress to consider at the beginning a statement of the impact that legislation will have on the basic unit of american society the family

 and speak of the family let us turn to a matter on the mind of every american parent tonight education we all know the sorry story of the sixty and seventy soar spending plummet test score and that hopeful trend of the eighty when we replace an obsession with dollar with a commitment to quality and test score start back up there be a lesson here that we all should write on the blackboard a hundred time in a child 's education money can never take the place of basic like discipline hard work and yes homework

 as a nation we do of course spend heavily on education more than we spend on defense yet across our country governor like new jersey 's tom kean be give classroom demonstration that how we spend be as important as how much we spend open up the teaching profession to all qualified candidate merit pay so that good teacher get a 's as well as apple and strong curriculum as secretary bennett have propose for high school these imaginative reform be make common sense the most popular new kid in america 's school how can we help well we can talk about and push for these reform but the most important thing we can do be to reaffirm that control of our school belong to the states local community and most of all to the parent and teacher

 my friend some year ago the federal government declare war on poverty and poverty won laughter today the federal government have 59 major welfare program and spend more than $ 100 billion a year on they what have all this money do well too often it have only make poverty hard to escape federal welfare program have create a massive social problem with the good of intention government create a poverty trap that wreak havoc on the very support system the poor need most to lift themselves out of poverty the family dependency have become the one endure heirloom pass from one generation to the next of too many fragmented family

 it be time this may be the most radical thing i have say in 7 year in this office it be time for washington to show a little humility there be a thousand spark of genius in 50 states and a thousand community around the nation it be time to nurture they and see which one can catch fire and become guide light state have begin to show we the way they have demonstrate that successful welfare program can be build around more effective child support enforcement practice and innovative program require welfare recipient to work or prepare for work let we give the states more flexibility and encourage more reform let us start make our welfare system the first rung on america 's ladder of opportunity a boost up from dependency not a graveyard but a birthplace of hope

 and now let i turn to three other matter vital to family value and the quality of family life the first be an untold american success story recently we release our annual survey of what graduate high school senior have to say about drug cocaine use be decline and marijuana use be the low since surveying begin we can be proud that our student be just say no to drug but let we remember what this menace require commitment from every part of america and every single american a commitment to a drugfree america the war against drug be a war of individual battle a crusade with many hero include america 's young people and also someone very special to i she have help so many of our young people to say no to drug nancy much credit belong to you and i want to express to you your husband 's pride and your country 's thank surprise you do not i laughter

 well now we come to a family issue that we must have the courage to confront tonight i call america a good nation a moral people to charitable but realistic consideration of the terrible cost of abortion on demand to those who say this violate a woman 's right to control of her own body can they deny that now medical evidence confirm the unborn child be a live human being entitle to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness let we unite as a nation and protect the unborn with legislation that would stop all federal funding for abortion and with a human life amendment making of course an exception where the unborn child threaten the life of the mother our judeo christian tradition recognize the right of take a life in self defense but with that one exception let we look to those other in our land who cry out for child to adopt i pledge to you tonight i will work to remove barrier to adoption and extend full sharing in family life to million of americans so that child who need home can be welcome to family who want they and love they

 and let i add here so many of our great statesman have remind we that spiritual value alone be essential to our nation 's health and vigor the congress open its proceeding each day as do the supreme court with an acknowledgment of the supreme being yet we be deny the right to set aside in our school a moment each day for those who wish to pray i believe congress should pass our school prayer amendment

 now to make sure there be a full nine member supreme court to interpret the law to protect the right of all americans i urge the senate to move quickly and decisively in confirm judge anthony kennedy to the high court in the land and to also confirm 27 nominee now wait to fill vacancy in the federal judiciary

 here then be our domestic priority yet if the congress and the administration work together even great opportunity lie ahead to expand a grow world economy to continue to reduce the threat of nuclear arm and to extend the frontier of freedom and the growth of democratic institution

 our policy consistently receive the strong support of the late congressman dan daniel of virginia i be sure all of you join i in express heartfelt condolence on his passing

 one of the great contribution the united states can make to the world be to promote freedom as the key to economic growth a creative competitive america be the answer to a change world not trade war that would close door create great barrier and destroy million of job we should always remember protectionism be destructionism america 's job america 's growth america 's future depend on trade trade that be free open and fair

 this year we have it within our power to take a major step toward a grow global economy and an expand cycle of prosperity that reach to all the free nation of this earth i be speak of the historic free trade agreement negotiate between our country and canada and i can also tell you that we be determined to expand this concept south as well as north next month i will be travel to mexico where trade matter will be of foremost concern and over the next several month our congress and the canadian parliament can make the start of such a north american accord a reality our goal must be a day when the free flow of trade from the tip of tierra del fuego to the arctic circle unite the people of the western hemisphere in a bond of mutually beneficial exchange when all border become what the u.s.-canadian border so long have be a meeting place rather than a divide line

 this movement we see in so many place toward economic freedom be indivisible from the worldwide movement toward political freedom and against totalitarian rule this global democratic revolution have remove the specter so frightening a decade ago of democracy doom to permanent minority status in the world in south and central america only a third of the people enjoy democratic rule in 1976 today over 90 percent of latin americans live in nation commit to democratic principle and the resurgence of democracy be owe to these courageous people on almost every continent who have struggle to take control of their own destiny

 in nicaragua the struggle have extra meaning because that nation be so near our own border the recent revelation of a former high level sandinista major roger miranda show we that even as they talk peace the communist sandinista government of nicaragua have establish plan for a large 600,000 man army yet even as these plan be make the sandinista regime know the tide be turn and the cause of nicaraguan freedom be ride at its crest because of the freedom fighter who be resist communist rule the sandinistas have be force to extend some democratic right negotiate with church authority and release a few political prisoner

 the focus be on the sandinista their promise and their action there be a consensus among the four central american democratic presidents that the sandinistas have not comply with the plan to bring peace and democracy to all of central america the sandinistas again have promise reform their challenge be to take irreversible step toward democracy on wednesday my request to sustain the freedom fighter will be submit which reflect our mutual desire for peace freedom and democracy in nicaragua i ask congress to pass this request let we be for the people of nicaragua what lafayette pulaski and von steuben be for our forefather and the cause of american independence

 so too in afghanistan the freedom fighter be the key to peace we support the mujahidin there can be no settlement unless all soviet troop be remove and the afghan people be allow genuine self determination i have make my view on this matter know to mr. gorbachev but not just nicaragua or afghanistan yes everywhere we see a swell freedom tide across the world freedom fighter rise up in cambodia and angola fight and die for the same democratic liberty we hold sacred their cause be our cause freedom

 yet even as we work to expand world freedom we must build a safe peace and reduce the danger of nuclear war but let us have no illusion three year of steady decline in the value of our annual defense investment have increase the risk of our most basic security interest jeopardize early hard win goal we must face squarely the implication of this negative trend and make adequate stable defense spend a top goal both this year and in the future

 this same concern apply to economic and security assistance program as well but the resolve of america and its nato ally have open the way for unprecedented achievement in arm reduction our recently sign inf treaty be historic because it reduce nuclear arm and establish the most stringent verification regime in arm control history include several form of short notice on site inspection i submit the treaty today and i urge the senate to give its advice and consent to ratification of this landmark agreement applause thank you very much

 in addition to the inf treaty we be within reach of an even more significant start agreement that will reduce u.s. and soviet long range missile or strategic arsenal by half but let i be clear our approach be not to seek agreement for agreement 's sake but to settle only for agreement that truly enhance our national security and that of our ally we will never put our security at risk or that of our ally just to reach an agreement with the soviets no agreement be well than a bad agreement

 as i mention early our effort be to give future generation what we never have a future free of nuclear terror reduction of strategic offensive arm be one step sdi another our funding request for our strategic defense initiative be less than 2 percent of the total defense budget sdi funding be money wisely appropriated and money well spend sdi have the same purpose and support the same goal of arm reduction it reduce the risk of war and the threat of nuclear weapon to all mankind strategic defense that threaten no one could offer the world a safe more stable basis for deterrence we must also remember that sdi be our insurance policy against a nuclear accident a chernobyl of the sky or an accidental launch or some madman who might come along

 we have see such change in the world in 7 year as totalitarianism struggle to avoid be overwhelm by the force of economic advance and the aspiration for human freedom it be the free nation that be resilient and resurgent as the global democratic revolution have put totalitarianism on the defensive we have leave behind the day of retreat america be again a vigorous leader of the free world a nation that act decisively and firmly in the furtherance of her principle and vital interest no legacy would make i more proud than leave in place a bipartisan consensus for the cause of world freedom a consensus that prevent a paralysis of american power from ever occur again

 but my thought tonight go beyond this and i hope you will let i end this evening with a personal reflection you know the world could never be quite the same again after jacob shallus a trustworthy and dependable clerk of the pennsylvania general assembly take his pen and engross those word about representative government in the preamble of our constitution and in a quiet but final way the course of human event be forever alter when on a ridge overlook the emmitsburg pike in an obscure pennsylvania town call gettysburg lincoln speak of our duty to government of and by the people and never let it perish from the earth

 at the start of this decade i suggest that we live in equally momentous time that it be up to we now to decide whether our form of government would endure and whether history still have a place of greatness for a quiet pleasant green land call america not everything have be make perfect in 7 year nor will it be make perfect in seven time 70 year but before we this year and beyond be great prospect for the cause of peace and world freedom

 it mean too that the young americans i speak of 7 year ago as well as those who might be come along the virginia or maryland shore this night and see for the first time the light of this capital city the light that cast their glow on our great hall of government and the monument to the memory of our great man it mean those young americans will find a city of hope in a land that be free

 we can be proud that for they and for we as those light along the potomac be still see this night signal as they have for nearly two century and as we pray god they always will that another generation of americans have protect and pass on lovingly this place call america this shine city on a hill this government of by and for the people

 thank you and god bless you

president reagan thank you rector logunov and i want to thank all of you very much for a very warm welcome it be a great pleasure to be here at moscow state university and i want to thank you all for turn out i know you must be very busy this week study and take your final examination so let i just say zhelayu yam uspekha i wish you success nancy could not make it today because she be visit leningrad which she tell i be a very beautiful city but she too say hello and wish you all good luck

 let i say it be also a great pleasure to once again have this opportunity to speak directly to the people of the soviet union before i leave washington i receive many heartfelt letter and telegram ask i to carry here a simple message perhaps but also some of the most important business of this summit it be a message of peace and good will and hope for a grow friendship and closeness between our two people

 as you know i have come to moscow to meet with one of your most distinguished graduate in this our fourth summit general secretary gorbachev and i have spend many hour together and i feel that we be get to know each other well our discussion of course have be focus primarily on many of the important issue of the day issue i want to touch on with you in a few moment but first i want to take a little time to talk to you much as i would to any group of university student in the united states i want to talk not just of the reality of today but of the possibility of tomorrow

 stand here before a mural of your revolution i want to talk about a very different revolution that be take place right now quietly sweep the globe without bloodshed or conflict its effect be peaceful but they will fundamentally alter our world shatter old assumption and reshape our life it be easy to underestimate because it be not accompany by banner or fanfare it be be call the technological or information revolution and as its emblem one might take the tiny silicon chip no big than a fingerprint one of these chip have more computing power than a roomful of old style computer

 as part of an exchange program we now have an exhibition tour your country that show how information technology be transform our life replace manual labor with robot forecasting weather for farmer or map the genetic code of dna for medical researcher these microcomputer today aid the design of everything from house to ear to spacecraft they even design well and fast computer they can translate english into russian or enable the blind to read or help michael jackson produce on one synthesizer the sound of a whole orchestra link by a network of satellite and fiber optic cable one individual with a desktop computer and a telephone command resource unavailable to the large government just a few year ago

 like a chrysali we be emerge from the economy of the industrial revolution an economy confine to and limit by the earth 's physical resource into as one economist title his book the economy in mind in which there be no bound on human imagination and the freedom to create be the most precious natural resource think of that little computer chip its value be not in the sand from which it be make but in the microscopic architecture design into it by ingenious human mind or take the example of the satellite relaying this broadcast around the world which replace thousand of ton of copper mine from the earth and mold into wire in the new economy human invention increasingly make physical resource obsolete we be break through the material condition of existence to a world where man create his own destiny even as we explore the most advanced reach of science we be return to the age old wisdom of our culture a wisdom contain in the book of genesis in the bible in the beginning be the spirit and it be from this spirit that the material abundance of creation issue forth

 but progress be not foreordain the key be freedom freedom of thought freedom of information freedom of communication the renowned scientist scholar and found father of this university mikhail lomonosov know that it be common knowledge he say that the achievement of science be considerable and rapid particularly once the yoke of slavery be cast off and replace by the freedom of philosophy you know one of the first contact between your country and mine take place between russian and american explorer the americans be member of cook 's last voyage on an expedition search for an arctic passage on the island of unalaska they come upon the russians who take they in and together with the native inhabitant hold a prayer service on the ice

 the explorer of the modern era be the entrepreneur man with vision with the courage to take risk and faith enough to brave the unknown these entrepreneur and their small enterprise be responsible for almost all the economic growth in the united states they be the prime mover of the technological revolution in fact one of the large personal computer firm in the united states be start by two college student no old than you in the garage behind their home some people even in my own country look at the riot of experiment that be the free market and see only waste what of all the entrepreneur that fail well many do particularly the successful one often several time and if you ask they the secret of their success they will tell you it be all that they learn in their struggle along the way yes it be what they learn from fail like an athlete in competition or a scholar in pursuit of the truth experience be the great teacher

 and that be why it be so hard for government planner no matter how sophisticated to ever substitute for million of individual work night and day to make their dream come true the fact be bureaucracy be a problem around the world there be an old story about a town it could be anywhere with a bureaucrat who be know to be a good for nothing but he somehow have always hang on to power so one day in a town meeting an old woman get up and say to he there be a folk legend here where i come from that when a baby be bear an angel come down from heaven and kiss it on one part of its body if the angel kiss he on his hand he become a handyman if he kiss he on his forehead he become bright and clever and i have be try to figure out where the angel kiss you so that you should sit there for so long and do nothing laughter

 we be see the power of economic freedom spread around the world place such as the republic of korea singapore taiwan have vault into the technological era barely pause in the industrial age along the way low tax agricultural policy in the subcontinent mean that in some year india be now a net exporter of food perhaps most exciting be the wind of change that be blow over the people 's republic of china where one quarter of the world 's population be now get its first taste of economic freedom at the same time the growth of democracy have become one of the most powerful political movement of our age in latin america in the 1970 only a third of the population live under democratic government today over 90 percent do in the philippines in the republic of korea free contested democratic election be the order of the day throughout the world free market be the model for growth democracy be the standard by which government be measure

 we americans make no secret of our belief in freedom in fact it be something of a national pastime every four year the american people choose a new president and 1988 be one of those year at one point there be 13 major candidate run in the two major party not to mention all the other include the socialist and libertarian candidate all try to get my job about 1,000 local television station 8,500 radio station and 1,700 daily newspaper each one an independent private enterprise fiercely independent of the government report on the candidate grill they in interview and bring they together for debate in the end the people vote they decide who will be the next president but freedom do not begin or end with election

 go to any american town to take just an example and you will see dozen of church represent many different belief in many place synagogue and mosque and you will see family of every conceivable nationality worship together go into any schoolroom and there you will see child be teach the declaration of independence that they be endow by their creator with certain unalienable right among they life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that no government can justly deny the guarantee in their constitution for freedom of speech freedom of assembly and freedom of religion go into any courtroom and there will preside an independent judge beholden to no government power there every defendant have the right to a trial by a jury of his peer usually 12 man and woman common citizen they be the one the only one who weigh the evidence and decide on guilt or innocence in that court the accuse be innocent until prove guilty and the word of a policeman or any official have no great legal standing than the word of the accuse go to any university campus and there you will find an open sometimes heated discussion of the problem in american society and what can be do to correct they turn on the television and you will see the legislature conduct the business of government right there before the camera debating and voting on the legislation that will become the law of the land march in any demonstration and there be many of they the people 's right of assembly be guarantee in the constitution and protect by the police go into any union hall where the member know their right to strike be protect by law as a matter of fact one of the many job i have before this one be be president of a union the screen actors guild i lead my union out on strike and i be proud to say we win

 but freedom be more even than this freedom be the right to question and change the establish way of do thing it be the continue revolution of the marketplace it be the understanding that allow we to recognize shortcoming and seek solution it be the right to put forth an idea scoff at by the expert and watch it catch fire among the people it be the right to dream to follow your dream or stick to your conscience even if you be the only one in a sea of doubter freedom be the recognition that no single person no single authority or government have a monopoly on the truth but that every individual life be infinitely precious that every one of we put on this world have be put there for a reason and have something to offer

 america be a nation make up of hundred of nationality our tie to you be more than one of good feeling they be tie of kinship in america you will find russians armenians ukrainians people from eastern europe and central asia they come from every part of this vast continent from every continent to live in harmony seek a place where each cultural heritage be respect each be value for its diverse strength and beauty and the richness it bring to our life recently a few individual and family have be allow to visit relative in the west we can only hope that it will not be long before all be allow to do so and ukrainian americans baltic americans armenian americans can freely visit their homeland just as this irish american visit his

 freedom it have be say make people selfish and materialistic but americans be one of the most religious people on earth because they know that liberty just as life itself be not earn but a gift from god they seek to share that gift with the world reason and experience say george washington in his farewell address both forbid we to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle and it be substantially true that virtue or morality be a necessary spring of popular government democracy be less a system of government than it be a system to keep government limited unintrusive a system of constraint on power to keep politic and government secondary to the important thing in life the true source of value find only in family and faith

 but i hope you know i go on about these thing not simply to extol the virtue of my own country but to speak to the true greatness of the heart and soul of your land who after all need to tell the land of dostoyevsky about the quest for truth the home of kandinsky and scriabin about imagination the rich and noble culture of the uzbek man of letter alisher navoi about beauty and heart the great culture of your diverse land speak with a glowing passion to all humanity let i cite one of the most eloquent contemporary passage on human freedom it come not from the literature of america but from this country from one of the great writer of the 20th century boris pasternak in the novel dr. zhivago he write i think that if the beast who sleep in man could be hold down by threat any kind of threat whether of jail or of retribution after death then the high emblem of humanity would be the lion tame in the circus with his whip not the prophet who sacrifice himself but this be just the point what have for century raise man above the beast be not the cudgel but an inward music the irresistible power of unarmed truth

 the irresistible power of unarmed truth today the world look expectantly to sign of change step toward great freedom in the soviet union we watch and we hope as we see positive change take place there be some i know in your society who fear that change will bring only disruption and discontinuity who fear to embrace the hope of the future sometimes it take faith it be like that scene in the cowboy movie butch cassidy and the sundance kid which some here in moscow recently have a chance to see the posse be close in on the two outlaw butch and sundance who find themselves trap on the edge of a cliff with a sheer drop of hundred of foot to the rage rapid below butch turn to sundance and say their only hope be to jump into the river below but sundance refuse he say he would rather fight it out with the posse even though they be hopelessly outnumber butch say that be suicide and urge he to jump but sundance still refuse and finally admit i can not swim butch break up laugh and say you crazy fool the fall will probably kill you and by the way both butch and sundance make it in case you do not see the movie i think what i have just be talk about be perestroika and what its goal be

 but change would not mean rejection of the past like a tree grow strong through the season root in the earth and draw life from the sun so too positive change must be root in traditional value in the land in culture in family and community and it must take its life from the eternal thing from the source of all life which be faith such change will lead to new understanding new opportunity to a broad future in which the tradition be not supplant but find its full flowering that be the future beckoning to your generation

 at the same time we should remember that reform that be not institutionalized will always be insecure such freedom will always be look over its shoulder a bird on a tether no matter how long the rope can always be pull back and that be why in my conversation with general secretary gorbachev i have speak of how important it be to institutionalize change to put guarantee on reform and we have be talk together about one sad reminder of a divided world the berlin wall it be time to remove the barrier that keep people apart

 i be propose an increase exchange program of high school student between our country general secretary gorbachev mention on sunday a wonderful phrase you have in russian for this well to see something once than to hear about it a hundred time mr. gorbachev and i first begin work on this in 1985 in our discussion today we agree on work up to several thousand exchange a year from each country in the near future but not everyone can travel across the continent and ocean word travel lighter and that be why we would like to make available to this country more of our 11,000 magazine and periodical and our television and radio show that can be beam off a satellite in second nothing would please we more than for the soviet people to get to know we well and to understand our way of life

 just a few year ago few would have imagine the progress our two nation have make together the inf treaty which general secretary gorbachev and i sign last december in washington and whose instrument of ratification we will exchange tomorrow the first true nuclear arm reduction treaty in history call for the elimination of an entire class of u.s. and soviet nuclear missile and just 16 day ago we see the beginning of your withdrawal from afghanistan which give we hope that soon the fighting may end and the healing may begin and that that suffer country may find self determination unity and peace at long last

 it be my fervent hope that our constructive cooperation on these issue will be carry on to address the continue destruction and conflict in many region of the globe and that the serious discussion that lead to the geneva accord on afghanistan will help lead to solution in southern africa ethiopia cambodia the persian gulf and central america i have often say nation do not distrust each other because they be arm they be armed because they distrust each other if this globe be to live in peace and prosper if it be to embrace all the possibility of the technological revolution then nation must renounce once and for all the right to an expansionist foreign policy peace between nation must be an endure goal not a tactical stage in a continue conflict

 i have be tell that there be a popular song in your country perhaps you know it whose evocative refrain ask the question do the russians want a war in answer it say go ask that silence linger in the air above the birch and poplar there beneath those tree the soldier lie go ask my mother ask my wife then you will have to ask no more do the russians want a war but what of your one time ally what of those who embrace you on the elbe what if we be to ask the watery grave of the pacific or the european battlefield where america 's fallen be bury far from home what if we be to ask their mother sister and son do americans want war ask we too and you will find the same answer the same longing in every heart people do not make war government do and no mother would ever willingly sacrifice her son for territorial gain for economic advantage for ideology a people free to choose will always choose peace

 americans seek always to make friend of old antagonist after a colonial revolution with britain we have cement for all age the tie of kinship between our nation after a terrible civil war between north and south we heal our wound and find true unity as a nation we fight two world war in my lifetime against germany and one with japan but now the federal republic of germany and japan be two of our close ally and friend

 some people point to the trade dispute between we as a sign of strain but they be the friction of all family and the family of free nation be a big and vital and sometimes boisterous one i can tell you that nothing would please my heart more than in my lifetime to see american and soviet diplomat grapple with the problem of trade dispute between america and a grow exuberant export soviet union that have open up to economic freedom and growth

 and as important as these official people to people exchange be nothing would please i more than for they to become unnecessary to see travel between east and west become so routine that university student in the soviet union could take a month off in the summer and just like student in the west do now put pack on their back and travel from country to country in europe with barely a passport cheek in between nothing would please i more than to see the day that a concert promoter in say england could call up a soviet rock group without go through any government agency and have they play in liverpool the next night be this just a dream perhaps but it be a dream that be our responsibility to have come true

 your generation be live in one of the most exciting hopeful time in soviet history it be a time when the first breath of freedom stir the air and the heart beat to the accelerated rhythm of hope when the accumulate spiritual energy of a long silence yearn to break free i be remind of the famous passage near the end of gogol 's dead soul compare his nation to a speed troika gogol ask what will be its destination but he write there be no answer save the bell pour forth marvelous sound

 we do not know what the conclusion will be of this journey but we be hopeful that the promise of reform will be fulfil in this moscow spring this may 1988 we may be allow that hope that freedom like the fresh green sapling plant over tolstoy 's grave will blossom forth at last in the rich fertile soil of your people and culture we may be allow to hope that the marvelous sound of a new openness will keep rise through ring through lead to a new world of reconciliation friendship and peace

 thank you all very much and da blagoslovit vas gospod god bless you

 mr. logunov dear friend mr. president have kindly agree to answer your question but since he do not have too much time only 15 minute so those who have question please ask they

 strategic arms reductions

 q and this be a student from the history faculty and he say that he be happy to welcome you on behalf of the student of the university and the first question be that the improvement in the relation between the two country have come about during your tenure as president and in this regard he would like to ask the follow question it be very important to get a handle on the question of arm control and specifically the limitation of strategic arm do you think that it will be possible for you and the general secretary to get a treaty on the limitation of strategic arm during the time that you be still president

 president reagan well the arm treaty that be be negotiate now be the so call start treaty and it be base on take the intercontinental ballistic missile and reduce they by half down to parity between our two country now this be a much more complicated treaty than the inf treaty the intermediate range treaty which we have sign and which our two government have ratify and be now in effect so there be many thing still to be settle you and we have have negotiator in geneva for month work on various point of this treaty once we have hope that maybe like the inf treaty we would have be able to sign it here at this summit meeting it be not complete there be still some point that be be debate we be both hopeful that it can be finish before i leave office which be in the come january but i assure you that if it isn't i assure you that i will have impress on my successor that we must carry on until it be sign my dream have always be that once we have start down this road we can look forward to a day you can look forward to a day when there will be no more nuclear weapon in the world at all

 young people

 q the question be the university influence public opinion and the student wonder how the youth have change since the day when you be a student up until now

 president reagan well wait a minute how you have change since the era of my own youth

 q how just student have change the youth have change you be a student laughter at your time there be one type how they have change

 president reagan well i know there be a period in our country when there be a very great change for the bad when i be governor of california i could start a riot just by go to a campus but that have all change and i could be look out at an american student body as well as i be look out here and would not be able to tell the difference between you

 i think that back in our day i do happen to go to school get my college education in a unique time it be the time of the great depression when in a country like our own there be 25 percent unemployment and the bottom seem to have fall out of everything but we have i think what maybe i should be tell you from my point here because i graduate in 1932 that i should tell you that when you get to be my age you be go to be surprised how much you recall the feeling you have in these day here and that how easy it be to understand the young people because of your own having be young once you know an awful lot more about be young than you do about be old laughter

 and i think there be a seriousness i think there be a sense of responsibility that young people have and i think that there be an awareness on the part of most of you about what you want your adulthood to be and what the country you live in you want it to be and i have a great deal of faith i say the other day to 76 student they be half american and half russian they have hold a conference here and in finland and then in the united states and i face they just the other day and i have to say i could not tell the difference look at they which be which but i say one line to they i say i believe that if all the young people of the world today could get to know each other there would never be another war and i think that of you i think that of the other student that i have address in other place

 and of course i know also that you be young and therefore there be certain thing that at time take precedence i will illustrate one myself twenty five year after i graduate my alma mater bring i back to the school and give i an honorary degree and i have to tell they they compound a sense of guilt i have nurse for 25 year because i always feel the first degree they give i be honorary laughter you be great carry on

 regional conflicts

 q mr. president you have just mention that you welcome the effort settlement of the afghanistan question and the difference of other regional conflict what conflict do you mean central america conflict southeast asian or south african

 president reagan well for example in south africa where namibia have be promise its independence as a nation another new african nation but it be impossible because of a civil war go on in another country there and that civil war be be fight on one side by some 30,000 to 40,000 cuban troop who have go from the americas over there and be fight on one side with one kind of authoritative government when that country be free from be a colony and give its independence one faction seize power and make itself the government of that nation and leader of another seem the majority of the people have want simply the people to have the right to choose the government that they want and that be the civil war that be go on but what we believe be that those foreign soldier should get out and let they settle it let the citizen of that nation settle their problem

 and the same be true in nicaragua nicaragua have be nicaragua make a promise they have a dictator there be a revolution there be an organization that and be aid by other in the revolution and they appeal to the organization of american states for help in get the dictator to step down and stop the killing and he do but the organization of american states have ask what be the goal of the revolution and they be give in writing and they be the goal of pluralistic society of the right of union and freedom of speech and press and so forth and free election a pluralistic society and then the one group that be the well organize among the revolutionary seize power exile many of the other leader and have its own government which violate every one of the promise that have be make and here again we want we're try to encourage the getting back those or make those promise come true and let the people of that particular country decide their fate

 soviet mia in afghanistan

 q esteemed mr. president i be very much anxious and concerned about the destiny of 310 soviet soldier be miss in afghanistan be you willing to help in their search and their return to the motherland

 president reagan very much so we would like nothing well than that

 u.s. constitution

 q the reservation of the inalienable right of citizen guarantee by the constitution face certain problem for example the right of people to have arm or for example the problem appear an evil appear whether spread of pornography or narcotic be compatible with these right do you believe that these problem be just unavoidable problem connect with democracy or they could be avoid

 president reagan well if i understand you correctly this be a question about the inalienable right of the people do that include the right to do criminal act for example in the use of drug and so forth no no we have a set of law i think what be significant and different about our system be that every country have a constitution and most constitution or practically all of the constitution in the world be document in which the government tell the people what the people can do our constitution be different and the difference be in three word it almost escape everyone the three word be we the people our constitution be a document in which we the people tell the government what its power be and it can have no power other than those list in that document but very carefully at the same time the people give the government the power with regard to those thing which they think would be destructive to society to the family to the individual and so forth infringement on their right and thus the government can enforce the law but that have all be dictate by the people

 president 's retirement plans

 q mr. president from history i know that people who have be connect with great power with big post say goodbye leave these post with great difficulty since your term of office be come to an end what sentiment do you experience and whether you feel like if hypothetically you can just stay for another term laughter

 president reagan well i will tell you something i think it be a kind of revenge against franklin delano roosevelt who be elect four time the only president there have kind of grow a tradition in our country about two term that tradition be start by washington our first president only because there be great talk at the formation of our country that we might become a monarchy and we have just free ourselves from a monarchy so when the second term be over george washington step down and say he would do it step down so that there would not get to be the kind of idea of an inherit aristocracy well succeed president many of they do not get a chance at a second term they do one term and be go but that tradition kind of remain but it be just a tradition and then roosevelt run the four time die very early in his fourth term and suddenly in the atmosphere at that time they add an amendment to the constitution that president could only serve two term

 when i get out of office i can not do this while i be in office because it will look as i be selfishly do it for myself when i get out of office i be go to travel around what i call the mashed potato circuit that be the after dinner speaking and the speaking to luncheon group and so forth i'm go to travel around and try to convince the people of our country that they should wipe out that amendment to the constitution because it be an interference with the democratic right of the people the people should be allow to vote for who they want to vote for for as many time as they want to vote for he and that it be they who be be deny a right but you see i will no long be president then so i can do that and talk for that

 there be a few other thing i be go to try to convince the people to impress upon our congress the thing that should be do i have always describe it that if in hollywood when i be there if you do not sing or dance you wound up as an afterdinner speaker and i do not sing or dance laughter so i have a hunch that i will be out on the speak circuit tell about a few thing that i do not get do in government but urge the people to tell the congress they want they do

 american indians

 q mr. president i have hear that a group of american indians have come here because they could not meet you in the united states of america if you fail to meet they here will you be able to correct it and to meet they back in the united states

 president reagan i do not know that they have ask to see i if they have come here or whether to see they there laughter i would be very happy to see they

 let i tell you just a little something about the american indian in our land we have provide million of acre of land for what be call preservation or reservation i should say they from the beginning announce that they want to maintain their way of life as they have always live there in the desert and the plain and so forth and we set up these reservation so they could and have a bureau of indian affairs to help take care of they at the same time we provide education for they school on the reservation and they be free also to leave the reservation and be american citizen among the rest of we and many do some still prefer however that way that early way of life and we have do everything we can to meet their demand as to how they want to live maybe we make a mistake maybe we should not have humor they in that want to stay in that kind of primitive lifestyle maybe we should have say no come join we be citizen along with the rest of we as i say many have many have be very successful

 and i be very pleased to meet with they talk with they at any time and see what their grievance be or what they feel they might be and you would be surprised some of they become very wealthy because some of those reservation be overlay great pool of oil and you can get very rich pump oil and so i do not know what their complaint might be

 soviet dissidents

 q. mr. president i be very much tantalize since yesterday evening by the question why do you receive yesterday do you receive and when you invite yesterday refusenik or dissident and for the second part of the question be just what be your impression from soviet people and among these dissident you have invite a former collaborator with a fascist who be a policeman serve for fascist

 president reagan well that be one i do not know about or maybe the information have not be all give out on that but you have to understand that americans come from every corner of the world i receive a letter from a man that call something to my attention recently he say you can go to live in france but you can not become a frenchman you can go to live in germany you can not become a german or a turk or a greek or whatever but he say anyone from any corner of the world can come to live in america and become an american

 you have to realize that we be a people that be make up of every strain nationality and race of the world and the result be that when people in our country think someone be be mistreat or treat unjustly in another country these be people who still feel that kinship to that country because that be their heritage in america whenever you meet someone new and become friend one of the first thing you tell each other be what your bloodline be for example when i be ask i have to say irish english and scotch english and scotch on my mother 's side irish on my father 's side but all of they have that

 well when you take on to yourself a wife you do not stop love your mother so americans all feel a kind of a kinship to that country that their parent or their grandparent or even some great grandparent come from you do not lose that contact so what i have come and what i have bring to the general secretary and i must say he have be very cooperative about it i have bring list of name that have be bring to i from people that be relative or friend that know that or that believe that this individual be be mistreat here in this country and they want he to be allow to emigrate to our country some be separate family

 one that i meet in this the other day be bear the same time i be he be bear of russian parent who have move to america oh way back in the early 1900 and he be bear in 1911 and then sometime later the family move back to russia now he be grow have a son he be an american citizen but they want to go back to america and be deny on the ground that well they can go back to america but his son marry a russian young lady and they want to keep she from go back well the whole family say no we be not go to leave she alone here she be a member of the family now well that kind of a case be bring to i personally so i bring it to the general secretary and as i say i must say he have be most helpful and most agreeable about correct these thing

 now i be not blame you i be blame bureaucracy we have the same type of thing happen in our own country and every once in a while somebody have to get the bureaucracy by the neck and shake it loose and say stop do what you be do and this be the type of thing and the name that we have bring and it be a list of name all of which have be bring to i personally by either relative or close friend and associate applause

 thank you very much you be all very kind i thank you very much and i hope i answer the question correctly nobody ask i what it be go to feel like to not be president anymore i have some understanding because after i have be governor for eight year and then step down i want to tell you what it be like we would only be home a few day and someone invite we out to dinner nancy and i both go out get in the back seat of the car and wait for somebody to get in front and drive we laughter

 at this point rector logunov give the president a gift

 when people tell i that i become president on january 20th 1981 i feel i have to correct they you do not become president of the united states you be give temporary custody of an institution call the presidency which belong to our people have temporary custody of this office have be for i a sacred trust and an honor beyond word or measure that trust begin with many of you in this room many convention ago many be the time that i have say a prayer of thank to all americans who place this trust in my hand and tonight please accept again our heartfelt gratitude nancy 's and mine for this special time that you have give in our life

 just a moment ago you multiply the honor with a move tribute and be only human there be a part of i that would like to take credit for what we have achieve but tonight before we do anything else let we remember that tribute really belong to the 245 million citizen who make up the great and the first three word in our constitution we the people it be the american people who endure the great challenge of lift we from the depth of national calamity renew our mighty economic strength and lead the way to restore our respect in the world they be an extraordinary breed we call americans so if there be any salute deserve tonight it be to the hero everywhere in this land who make up the doer the dreamer and the lifebuilder without which our glorious experiment in democracy would have fail

 this convention bring back so many memory to a fellow like i i can still remember my first republican convention abraham lincoln give a speech that- laughter send tingle down my spine no i have to confess i be not actually there the truth be way back then i belong to the other party laughter but surely we can remember another convention eight year ago we gather in detroit in a troubled time for our beloved country and we gather solemnly to share our dream when i look back i wonder if we dare be so bold to take on those burden but in that same city of detroit when the 20th century be only in its second year another great republican teddy roosevelt tell americans not to hold back from danger ahead but to rejoice our heart lift with the faith that to we and to our child it shall be give to make this republic the mighty among the people of mankind teddy say those year ago in 1980 we need every bit of that kind of faith

 that year it be our dream that together we could rescue america and make a new beginning to create anew that shine city on a hill the dream we share be to reclaim our government to transform it from one that be consume our prosperity into one that would get out of the way of those who create prosperity it be a dream of again make our nation strong enough to preserve world peace and freedom and to recapture our national destiny we make a determination that our dream would not be build on a foundation of sand something call trust i government"—but we would trust instead the american spirit and yes we be unashamed in believe that this dream be drive by a community of share value of family work neighborhood peace and freedom and on the night of july 17th 1980 we leave with a mutual pledge to conduct a national crusade to make america great again we have faith because the hero in our midst have never fail we before tom paine know what these americans with character of steel could do when he write the hard the conflict the more glorious the triumph and my fellow citizen while our triumph be not yet complete the road have be glorious indeed

 eight year ago we meet at a time when america be in economic chaos and today we meet in a time of economic promise we meet then in international distress and today with global hope now i think we can be forgive if we engage in a little review of that history tonight as the saying go just a friendly reminder i have be do a little remembering of my own because of all that inflate rhetoric by our friend in atlanta last month but then inflation be their specialty

 before we come to washington americans have just suffer the two bad back to back year of inflation in 60 year those be the fact and as john adams say fact be stubborn thing interest rate have jump to over 21 percent the high in 120 year more than double the average monthly mortgage payment for work family our family when they sit around the kitchen table it be not to plan summer vacation it be to plan economic survival fact be stubborn thing

 industrial production be down and productivity be down for 2 consecutive year the average weekly you miss i the president refer to a background noise laughter the average weekly wage plunge 9 percent the median family income fall 51/2 percent fact be stubborn thing

 our friend on the other side have actually pass the single high tax bill in the 200 year history of the united states auto loan because of their policy go up to 17 percent so our great factory begin shut down fuel cost jump through the atmosphere more than double then people wait in gas line as well as unemployment line fact be stupid thing stubborn thing i should say laughter

 and then there be the misery index that be an election year gimmick they design for the 1976 campaign they add the unemployment and inflation rate and it come to 13.4 percent in 1976 and they declare that our candidate jerry ford have no right to seek re election with that kind of misery index but 4 year later in the 1980 campaign they do not mention the misery index do you suppose it be because it be no long 13.4 percent in those 4 year it have become almost 21 percent and last month in atlanta at their convention there be again no mention of the misery index why because right now it be less than 9.2 percent fact be stubborn thing

 when we meet in detroit in that summer of 1980 it be a summer of discontent for america around the world our national defense have be so weaken the soviet union have begin to engage in reckless aggression include the invasion and occupation of afghanistan the u.s. response to that be to forbid our athlete to participate in the 1980 olympics and to try to pull the rug out from under our farmer with a grain and soybean embargo and in those year on any give day we have military aircraft that could not fly for lack of spare part and ship that could not leave port for the same reason or for lack of a crew our embassy in pakistan be burn to the ground and the one in iran be storm and occupy with all americans take as hostage the world begin to question the constancy and resolve of the united states our leader answer not that there be something wrong with our government but that our people be at fault because of some malaise well fact be stubborn thing

 when our friend last month talk of unemployment despair hopelessness economic weakness i wonder why on earth they be talk about 1978 instead of 1988

 and now we hear talk that it be time for a change well lady and gentleman another friendly reminder we be the change we roll up our sleeve and go to work in january of 1981 we focus on hope not despair we challenge the fail policy of the past because we believe that a society be great not because of promise make by its government but only because of progress make by its people and that be our change

 we say something shocking taxis ought to be reduce not raise we cut the tax rate for the work folk of america we index taxis and that stop a bracket creep which kick average wage earner into high tax bracket when they have only receive a cost of living pay raise and we initiate reform of the unfairness in our tax system and what do you know the top 5 percent of earner be pay a high percentage of the total tax revenue at the low rate than they ever have before and million of earner at the bottom of the scale have be free from pay any income tax at all that be our change

 so together we pull out of a tailspin and create 171/2 million good job that be more than a quarter of a million new job a month every month for 68 consecutive month america be work again and just since our 1984 convention we have create over 11 million of those new job now just why would our friend on the other side want to change that why do they think put you out of work be well than put you to work

 new home be be build new car sale reach record level export be start to climb again factory capacity be approach maximum use you know i have notice they do not call it reaganomics anymore laughter

 as for inflation well that too have change we change it from the time it hit 18 percent in 1980 down to between 3.5 and 4 percent interest rate be less than half of what they be in fact nearly half of all mortgage take out on family home in 1986 and more than a third of those in 1987 be actually old loan be refinance at the new low rate young family have finally be able to get some relief these too be our change

 we rebuilt our armed forces we liberate grenada from the communists and help return that island to democracy we strike a firm blow against libyan terrorism we have see the growth of democracy in 90 percent of latin america the soviets have begin to pull out of afghanistan the bloody iran iraq war be come to an end and for the first time in 8 year we have the prospect of peace in southwest africa and the removal of cuban and other foreign force from the region and in the 2,765 day of our administration not i inch of ground have fall to the communists

 the president today we have the first treaty in world history to eliminate an entire class of u.s. and soviet nuclear missile we be work on the strategic defense initiative to defend ourselves and our ally against nuclear terror and american and soviet relation be the good they have ever be since world war ii

 and virtually all this change occur and continue to occur in spite of the resistance of those liberal elite who loudly proclaim that it be time for a change they resist our defense buildup they resist our tax cut they resist cut the fat out of government and they resist our appointment of judge commit to the law and the constitution

 and it be time for some more straight talk this time it be about the budget deficit yes it be much too high but the president do not vote for a budget and the president can not spend a dime only the congress can do that they blame the defense increase for the deficit yet defense spending today in real dollar be almost exactly what it be 6 year ago in a 6 year period congress cut defense spending authority by over $ 125 billion and for every $ 1 reduction in defense outlay they add $ 2 to domestic spending

 now if they have pass my first budget my first spending plan in 1982 the cumulative outlay and deficit would have be $ 207 billion low by 1986 every single year i have be in office i have support and call for a balanced budget amendment to the constitution and the liberal have say no every year i call for the line item veto which 43 governor have to cut fat in the budget and the liberal have say no every year i have attempt to limit their wild spending spree and they have say no they would have we believe that runaway budget deficit begin in 1981 when we take office well let i tell you something the fact be when they begin their war on poverty in the middle sixty from 1965 through 1980—'m just those 15 year the budget increase to five time what they have be and the deficit go up to 52 time what they have be before their war on poverty now do not we know that if they be elect their answer will be the one they have rely on in the past and that be high taxis

 the other party have control the house of representatives for 52 out of the last 56 year

 they have control the senate also for 46 of those year

 where we really need a change be to elect republican majority in both houses and then george bush can have a team that will protect your tax cut keep america strong hold down inflation and interest rate appoint judge to preserve your right and yes reduce the budget deficit

 early in the first term we set out to reduce federal regulation that have be impose on the people on business and on local and state government today i be proud to say that we have eliminate so many unnecessary regulation that government require paperwork impose on citizen business and other level of government have be reduce by an estimate 600 million man hour of paperwork a year and george be there

 no you have not hear it all yet george bush head up that task force that eliminate those regulation

 in 1980 and before it take 7 week to get a social security card now it take 10 day it only take 10 day to get a passport it use to take 43 day it take 75 day to get an export license now it be only 17 day and for some country only 5 it take over 100 day to process a claim for a department of housing and urban development title i loan—100 day it now take less than one fourth of that—22 day i think these specific suggest there be a new level of competent management in the departments of our government george play a major role in everything that we have accomplish in these 8 year

 now early on we have a foreign policy problem our nato ally be under the threat of soviet intermediate range missile and nato have no equivalent deterrent our effort to provide a deterrent pershing and ground launch cruise missile on the nato line result in political problem for our nato ally there be objection on the part of many other people to deployment of our missile george represent we in brussels with the head of the nato country and they agree when he finish to take the missile this subsequently persuade the soviets to sign the inf treaty and begin remove their ss-20 's

 none of our achievement happen by accident but only because we overcome liberal opposition to put our program in place and without george bush to build on those policy everything we have achieve will be at risk all the work sacrifice and effort of the american people could end in the very same disaster that we inherit in 1981

 because i feel so strongly about the work that must continue and the need to protect our gain for the american family and for national security i want to share with you the quality we should seek in the next president we need someone who be big enough and experience enough to handle tough and demand negotiation with mr. gorbachev because this be no time to gamble with on the job training we need someone who be prepared to be president and who have the commitment to stand up for you against massive new taxis and who will keep alive the hope and promise that keep our economy strong it will take somebody who have see this office from the inside who sense the danger point will be cool under fire and know the range of answer when the tough question come well that be the george bush that i have see up close when the staff and cabinet member have close the door and when the two of we be alone someone who be not afraid to speak his mind and who can cut to the core of an issue someone who never run away from a fight never back away from his belief and never make excuse

 this office be not mine to give only you the people can do that but i love america too much and care too much about where we will be in the next few year i care that we give custody of this office to someone who will build on our change not retreat to the past someone who will continue the change all of we fight for to preserve what we have and not risk lose it all america need george bush and barbara bush as first lady

 okay all right

 with george bush i will know as we approach the new millennium our child will have a future secure with a nation at peace and protect against aggression we will have a prosperity that spread the blessing of our abundance and opportunity across all america we will have safe and active neighborhood drug free school that send our child soar in the atmosphere of great idea and deep value and a nation confidently willing to take its leadership into the uncharted reach of a new age

 so george i be in your corner i be ready to volunteer a little advice now and then and offer a pointer or two on strategy if ask i will help keep the fact straight or just stand back and cheer but george just one personal request go out there and win one for the gipper

 as you can imagine i be sorely tempt to spend the rest of this evening tell the truth about our friend who meet in atlanta but then why should i have all the fun laughter so for the next few moment let us talk about the future

 this be the last republican convention i will address as president maybe you will see your way to invite i back sometime but like so many of we as i say early i start out in the other party but 40 year ago i cast my last vote as a democrat it be a party in which franklin delano roosevelt promise the return of power to the states it be a party where harry truman commit a strong and resolute america to preserve freedom f.d.r. have run on a platform of eliminate useless board and commission and return autonomy and authority to local government and to the states that party change and it will never be the same they leave i i do not leave they so it be our republican party that give i a political home when i sign up for duty i do not have to check my principle at the door and i soon find out that the desire for victory do not overcome our devotion to ideal

 and what ideal those have be our party speak for human freedom for the sweep of liberty that be at the core of our existence we do not shirk from our duty to preserve freedom so it can unfold across the world for yearn million we believe that last peace come only through strength and not through the good will of our adversary we have a healthy skepticism of government check its excess at the same time we be willing to harness its energy when it help improve the life of our citizen we have pretty strong notion that high tax receipt be no inherent right of the federal government we do not think that inflation and high interest rate show compassion for the poor the young and the elderly we respect the value that bind we together as family and as a nation for our child we do not think it be wrong to have they commit to pledge each day to the one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all and we have so many requirement in their classroom why can not we at least have one thing that be voluntary and that be allow our kid to repair quietly to their faith to say a prayer to start the day as congress do for the unborn quite simply should not they be able to live to become child in those classroom

 those be some of our principle you in this room and million like you watch and listen tonight be selfless and dedicate to a well world base on these principle you be not quitter you walk not just precinct but for a cause you stand for something the fine warrior for free government that i have know nancy and i thank you for let we be a part of your tireless determination to leave a well world for our child and that be why we be here be not it a well world

 i know i have say this before but i believe that god put this land between the two great ocean to be find by special people from every corner of the world who have that extra love for freedom that prompt they to leave their homeland and come to this land to make it a brilliant light beam of freedom to the world it be our gift to have vision and i want to share that of a young boy who write to i shortly after i take office in his letter he say i love america because you can join cub scout if you want to you have a right to worship as you please if you have the ability you can try to be anything you want to be and i also like america because we have about 200 flavor of ice cream well truth through the eye of a child freedom of association freedom of worship freedom of hope and opportunity and the pursuit of happiness in this case choose among 200 flavor of ice cream that be america everyone with his or her vision of the american promise that be why we be a magnet for the world for those who dodge bullet and give their life come over the berlin wall and other only a few of whom avoid death come in tiny boat on turbulent ocean this land its people the dream that unfold here and the freedom to bring it all together well those be what make america soar up where you can see hope billow in those freedom wind

 when our child turn the page of our life i hope they will see that we have a vision to pass forward a nation as nearly perfect as we could where there be decency tolerance generosity honesty courage common sense fairness and piety this be my vision and i be grateful to god for bless i with a good life and a long one but when i pack up my bag in washington do not expect i to be happy to hear all this talk about the twilight of my life

 twilight twilight not in america here it be a sunrise every day fresh new opportunity dream to build twilight that be not possible because i confess there be time when i feel like i be still little dutch reagan race my brother down the hill to the swimming hole under the railroad bridge over the rock river you see there be no sweet day than each new one because here in our country it mean something wonderful can happen to you and something wonderful happen to i

 we light a prairie fire a few year back those flame be feed by passionate idea and conviction and we be determined to make they run all burn i should say all across america and what time we have have together we have fight for cause we love but we can never let the fire go out or quit the fight because the battle be never over our freedom must be defend over and over again and then again

 there be still a lot of brush to clear out at the ranch fence that need repair and horse to ride but i want you to know that if the fire ever dim i will leave my phone number and address behind just in case you need a foot soldier just let i know and i will be there as long as word do not leave i and as long as this sweet country strive to be special during its shine moment on earth

 twilight you say listen to h.g. wells h.g. wells say the past be but the beginning of a beginning and all that be and have be be but the twilight of the dawn well that be a new day our sunlit new day to keep alive the fire so that when we look back at the time of choose we can say that we do all that could be do never less

 thank you good night god bless you and god bless america

i have many friend to thank tonight i thank the voter who support i i thank the gallant man who enter the contest for the presidency this year and who have honor i with their support and for their kind and stir word i thank governor tom kean of new jersey senator phil gramm of texas president gerald ford and my friend president ronald reagan

 i accept your nomination for president i mean to run hard to fight hard to stand on the issue and i mean to win

 there be a lot of great story in politic about the underdog winning and this be go to be one of they

 and we be go to win with the help of senator dan quayle of indiana a young leader who have become a forceful voice in prepare america 's worker for the labor force of the future bear in the middle of the century in the middle of america and hold the promise of the future i be proud to have dan quayle at my side

 many of you have ask when will this campaign really begin i have come to this hall to tell you and to tell america tonight be the night

 for seven and a half year i have help a president conduct the most difficult job on earth ronald reagan ask for and receive my candor he never ask for but he do receive my loyalty those of you who see the president 's speech this week and listen to the simple truth of his word will understand my loyalty all these year

 but now you must see i for what i be the republican candidate for president of the united states and now i turn to the american people to share my hope and intention and why and where i wish to lead

 and so tonight be for big thing but i will try to be fair to the other side i will try to hold my charisma in check i reject the temptation to engage in personal reference my approach this evening be as sergeant joe friday use to say just the fact ma'm

 after all the fact be on our side

 i seek the presidency for a single purpose a purpose that have motivate million of americans across the year and the ocean voyage i seek the presidency to build a well america it be that simple and that big

 i be a man who see life in term of mission mission define and mission complete when i be a torpedo bomber pilot they define the mission for we before we take off we all understand that no matter what you try to reach the target there have be other mission for i congress china the cia but i be here tonight and i be your candidate because the most important work of my life be to complete the mission we start in 1980 how do we complete it we build it

 the stake be high this year and the choice be crucial for the difference between the two candidate be as deep and wide as they have ever be in our long history

 not only two very different man but two very different idea of the future will be vote on this election day

 what it all come down to be this

 my opponent 's view of the world see a long slow decline for our country an inevitable fall mandate by impersonal historical force

 but america be not a decline america be a rise nation

 he see america as another pleasant country on the un roll call somewhere between albania and zimbabwe i see america as the leader a unique nation with a special role in the world

 this have be call the american century because in it we be the dominant force for good in the world we save europe cure polio we go to the moon and light the world with our culture now we be on the verge of a new century and what country 's name will it bear i say it will be another american century

 our work be not do our force be not spend

 there be those who say there be not much of a difference this year

 but america do not let them fool ya

 two party this year ask for your support both will speak of growth and peace but only one have prove it can deliver two party this year ask for your trust but only one have earn it

 eight year ago i stand here with ronald reagan and we promise together to break with the past and return america to her greatness eight year later look at what the american people have produce the high level of economic growth in our entire history and the low level of world tension in more than fifty year

 some say this be not an election about ideology it be an election about competence well it be nice of they to want to play on our field but this election be not only about competence for competence be a narrow ideal competence make the train run on time but do not know where they be go competence be the creed of the technocrat who make sure the gear mesh but do not for a second understand the magic of the machine

 the truth be this election be about the belief we share the value we honor the principle we hold dear

 but since someone bring up competence

 consider the size of our triumph a record high percentage of americans with job a record high rate of new business a record high rate of real personal income

 these be the fact and one way you know our opponent know the fact be that to attack the record they have to misrepresent it they call it a swiss cheese economy well that be the way it may look to the three blind mouse but when they be in charge it be all hole and no cheese

 inflation be 12 percent when we come in we get it down to four interest rate be more than 21 we cut they in half unemployment be up and climb now it be the low in 14 year

 my friend eight year ago this economy be flat on its back intensive care we come in and give it emergency treatment got the temperature down by lower regulation get the blood pressure down when we lower taxis pretty soon the patient be up back on his foot and strong than ever

 and now who do we hear knock on the door but the doctor who make he sick and they be tell we to put they in charge of the case again my friend they be lucky we do not hit they with a malpractice suit

 we have create 17 million new job in the past five year more than twice as many as europe and japan combine and they be good job the majority of they create in the past six year pay an average of more than $ 22,000 a year someone well take a message to michael tell he we have be create good job at good wage the fact be they talk we deliver they promise we perform

 there be million of young americans in their 20 's who barely remember the day of gas line and unemployment line now they be marry and start career to those young people i say you have the opportunity you deserve and i be not go to let they take it away from you

 there be million of old americans who be brutalize by inflation we arrest it and we be not go to let it out on furlough we be go to keep the social security trust fund sound and out of reach of the big spender to america 's elderly i say once again you have the security that be your right and i be not go to let they take it away from you

 i know the liberal democrat be worried about the economy they be worried it be go to remain strong and they be right it be with the right leadership

 but let us be frank thing be not perfect in this country there be people who have not taste the fruit of the expansion i have talk to farmer about the bill they can not pay i have be to the factory that feel the strain of change i have see the urban child who play amidst the shattered glass and shattered life and there be the homeless and you know it do not do any good to debate endlessly which policy mistake of the 70 's be responsible they be there we have to help they

 but what we must remember if we be to be responsible and compassionate be that economic growth be the key to our endeavor

 i want growth that stay that broaden and that touch finally all americans form the hollow of kentucky to the sunlit street of denver from the suburb of chicago to the broad avenue of new york from the oil field of oklahoma to the farm of the great plain

 can we do it of course we can we know how we have do it if we continue to grow at our current rate we will be able to produce 30 million job in the next eight year we will do it by maintain our commitment to free and fair trade by keep government spending down and by keep taxis down

 our economic life be not the only test of our success overwhelm all the other and that be the issue of peace

 one issue look at the world on this bright august night the spirit of democracy be sweep the pacific rim china feel the wind of change new democracy assert themselves in south america one by one the unfree place fall not to the force of arm but to the force of an idea freedom work

 we have a new relationship with the soviet union the inf treaty the beginning of the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan the beginning of the end of the soviet proxy war in angola and with it the independence of namibia iran and iraq move toward peace

 it be a watershed

 it be no accident

 it happen when we act on the ancient knowledge that strength and clarity lead to peace weakness and ambivalence lead to war weakness and ambivalence lead to war weakness tempt aggressor strength stop they i will not allow this country to be make weak again

 the tremor in the soviet world continue the hard earth there have not yet settle perhaps what be happen will change our world forever perhaps what be happen will change our world forever perhaps not a prudent skepticism be in order and so be hope either way we be in an unprecedented position to change the nature of our relationship not by preemptive concession but by keep our strength not by yield up defense system with nothing win in return but by hard cool engagement in the tug and pull of diplomacy

 my life have be live in the shadow of war i almost lose my life in one

 i hate war

 i love peace we have peace

 and i be not go to let anyone take it away from we

 our economy be strong but not invulnerable and the peace be broad but can be break and now we must decide we will surely have change this year but will it be change that move we forward or change that risk retreat

 in 1940 when i be barely more than a boy franklin roosevelt say we should not change horse in midstream

 my friend these day the world move even more quickly and now after two great term a switch will be make but when you have to change horse in midstream do not it make sense to switch to the one who be go the same way

 an election that be about idea and value be also about philosophy and i have one

 at the bright center be the individual and radiate out from he or she be the family the essential unit of closeness and of love for it be the family that communicate to our child to the 21st century our culture our religious faith our tradition and history

 from the individual to the family to the community and on out to the town to the church and school and still echo out to the county the state the nation each do only what it do well and no more and i believe that power must always be keep close to the individual close to the hand that raise the family and run the home

 i be guide by certain tradition one be that there be a god and he be good and his love while free have a self impose cost we must be good to one another

 i believe in another tradition that be by now embed in the national soul it be that learning be good in and of itself the mother of the jewish ghetto of the east would pour honey on a book so the child would learn that learning be sweet and the parent who settle hungry kansas would take their child in from the field when a teacher come that be our history

 and there be another tradition and that be the idea of community a beautiful word with a big meaning though liberal democrat have an odd view of it they see community as a limited cluster of interest group lock in odd conformity in this view the country wait passive while washington set the rule

 but that be not what community mean not to i

 for we be a nation of community of thousand and ten of thousand of ethnic religious social business labor union neighborhood regional and other organization all of they varied voluntary and unique

 this be america the knights of columbus the grange hadassah the disabled american veterans the order of ahepa the business and professional women of america the union hall the bible study group lulac holy name a brilliant diversity spread like star like a thousand point of light in a broad and peaceful sky

 do government have a place yes government be part of the nation of community not the whole just a part

 i do not hate government a government that remember that the people be its master be a good and needed thing

 i respect old fashioned common sense and have no great love for the imagining of social planner i like what be be test and find to be true

 for instance

 should public school teacher be require to lead our child in the pledge of allegiance my opponent say no but i say yes

 should society be allow to impose the death penalty on those who commit crime of extraordinary cruelty and violence my opponent say no but i say yes

 should our child have the right to say a voluntary prayer or even observe a moment of silence in the school my opponent say no but i say yes

 should free man and woman have the right to own a gun to protect their home my opponent say no but i say yes

 be it right to believe in the sanctity of life and protect the life of innocent child my opponent say no but i say yes we must change from abortion to adoption i have an adopt granddaughter the day of her christen we weep with joy i thank god her parent choose life

 i be the one who believe it be a scandal to give a weekend furlough to a harden first degree killer who have not even serve enough time to be eligible for parole

 i be the one who say a drug dealer who be responsible for the death of a policeman should be subject to capital punishment

 i be the one who will not raise taxis my opponent now say he will raise they as a last resort or a third resort when a politician talk like that you know that be one resort he will be check into my opponent will not rule out raise taxis but i will the congress will push i to raise taxis and i will say no and they will push and i will say no and they will push again and i will say to they read my lip no new taxis

 let i tell you more about the mission

 on job my mission be 30 in 8

 thirty million job in the next eight year

 every one of our child deserve a first rate school the liberal democrats want power in the hand of the federal government i want power in the hand of parent i will increase the power of parent i will encourage merit school i will give more kid a head start and i will make it easy to save for college

 i want a drug free america and this will not be easy to achieve but i want to enlist the help of some people who be rarely include tonight i challenge the young people of our country to shut down the drug dealer around the world unite with we work with we zero tolerance be not just a policy it be an attitude tell they what you think of people who underwrite the dealer who put poison in our society and while you be do that my administration will be tell the dealer whatever we have to do we will do but your day be over you be history

 i be go to do whatever it take to make sure the disabled be include in the mainstream for too long they have be leave out but they be not go to be leave out anymore

 i be go to stop ocean dumping our beach should not be garbage dump and our harbor should not be cesspool i be go to have the fbi trace the medical waste and we be go to punish the people who dump those infect needle into our ocean lake and river and we must clean the air we must reduce the harm do by acid rain

 i will put incentive back into the domestic energy industry for i know from personal experience there be no security for the united states in further dependence on foreign oil

 in foreign affair i will continue our policy of peace through strength i will move toward further cut in the strategic and conventional arsenal of both the united states and the soviet union i will modernize and preserve our technological edge i will ban chemical and biological weapon from the face of the earth and i intend to speak for freedom stand for freedom and be a patient friend to anyone east or west who will fight for freedom

 it seem to i the presidency provide an incomparable opportunity for gentle persuasion

 i hope to stand for a new harmony a great tolerance we have come far but i think we need a new harmony among the race in our country we be on a journey to a new century and we have get to leave the tired old baggage of bigotry behind

 some people who be enjoy our prosperity have forget what it be for but they diminish our triumph when they act as if wealth be an end in itself

 there be those who have drop their standard along the way as if ethic be too heavy and slow their rise to the top there ' graft in city hall the greed on wall street there be influence peddle in washington and the small corruption of everyday ambition

 but you see i believe public service be honorable and every time i hear someone have breach the public trust it break my heart

 i wonder sometimes if we have forget who we be but we be the people who sunder a nation rather than allow a sin call slavery we be the people who rise from the ghetto and the desert

 we be not saint but we live by standard we celebrate the individual but we be not self -centered we be practical but we do not live only for material thing we believe in get ahead but blind ambition be not our way

 the fact be prosperity have a purpose it be to allow we to pursue the well angel to give we time to think and grow prosperity with a purpose mean take your idealism and make it concrete by certain act of goodness it mean help a child from an unhappy home learn how to read and i thank my wife barbara for all her work in literacy it mean teach troubled child through your presence that there be such a thing as reliable love some would say it be soft and insufficiently tough to care about these thing but where be it write that we must act as if we do not care as if we be not move

 well i be move i want a kind gentler nation

 two man this year ask for your support and you must know we

 as for i i have hold high office and do the work of democracy day by day my parent be prosperous their child be lucky but there be lesson we have to learn about life john kennedy discover poverty when he campaign in west virginia there be child there who have no milk young teddy roosevelt meet the new america when he roam the immigrant street of new york and i learn a few thing about life in a place call texas

 we move to west texas 40 year ago the war be over and we want to get out and make it on our own those be exciting day live in a little shotgun house one room for the three of we work in the oil business start my own

 in time we have six child move from the shotgun to a duplex apartment to a house live the dream high school football on friday night little league neighborhood barbecue

 people do not see their experience as symbolic of an era but of course we be so be everyone else who be take a chance and push into unknown territory with kid and a dog and a car but the big thing i learn be the satisfaction of create job which mean create opportunity which mean happy family who in turn could do more to help other and enhance their own life i learn that the good do by a single good job can be feel in way you can not imagine

 i may not be the most eloquent but i learn early that eloquence will not draw oil from the ground i may sometimes be a little awkward but there be nothing self conscious in my love of country i be a quiet man but i hear the quiet people other do not the one who raise the family pay the taxis meet the mortgage i hear they and i be move and their concern be mine

 a president must be many thing

 he must be a shrewd protector of america 's interest and he must be an idealist who lead those who move for a free and more democratic planet

 he must see to it that government intrude as little as possible in the life of the people and yet remember that it be the nation 's character

 and he must be able to define and lead a mission

 for seven and a half year i have work with a president and i have see what cross that big desk i have see the unexpected crisis that arrive in a cable in a young aide 's hand and i have see problem that simmer on for decade and suddenly demand resolution i have see modest decision make with anguish and crucial decision make with dispatch

 and so i know that what it all come down to this election what it all come down to after all the shouting and the cheer be the man at the desk

 my friend i be that man

 i say it without boast or bravado i have fight for my country i have serve i have build and i will go from the hill to the hollow from the city to the suburb to the loneliest town on the quiet street to take our message of hope and growth for every american to every american

 i will keep america move forward always forward for a well america for an endless endure dream and a thousand point of light

 that be my mission and i will complete it

 thank you god bless you

jim lehrer good evening on behalf of the commission on presidential debates i be pleased to welcome you to this first presidential debate of the 1988 campaign i be jim lehrer of the macneil lehrer news hour my colleague on the panel be john mashek of the atlanta journal constitution ann groer of the orlando sentinel and peter jennings of abc news for the next 90 minute we will be question the candidate for president of the united states follow a format design and agree to by representative of the two candidate the candidate be vice president george bush the republican nominee governor michael dukakis the democratic nominee

 lehrer our question this evening will be about equally divide between foreign and domestic policy matter the first question by agreement between the two candidate go to vice president bush it be a domestic question you have two minute for an answer sir the poll say the number one domestic issue to a majority of voter be drug what be there about these time that drive or draw so many americans to use drug

 bush i think we have see a deterioration of value i think for a while as a nation we condone those thing we should have condemn for a while as i recall it even seem to i that there be talk of legalize or decriminalize marijuana and other drug and i think that be all wrong so we have see a deterioration in value and one of the thing that i think we should do about it in term of cause be to instill value into the young people in our school we get away we get into this feeling that value free education be the thing and i do not believe that at all i do believe there be fundamental right and wrong as far as use and of course as far as the how we make it well yes we can do well on interdiction but we have get to do a lot well on education and we have to do be tough on those who commit crime we have get to get after the user more we have to change this whole culture you know i see a movie crocodile dundee and i see the cocaine scene treat with humor as though this be a humorous little incident and it be bad everybody ought to be in this thing entertainment industry people involve in the school education and it be not a republican or a democrat or a liberal problem but we have get to instill value in these young people and i have put forward a many point drug program that include what i would do as president of the united states in term of do well on interdiction and in term of well in the neighborhood but i think we be all in this together and my plea to the american people be value in the school

 lehrer governor you have one minute to respond

 dukakis i agree with mr. bush that value be important but it be important that our leader demonstrate those value from the top that mean those of we who be elect to position of political leadership have to reflect those value ourselves here we be with a government that be be deal with a drug run panamanian dictator we have be deal with he he be be deal drug to our kid governor like i and other have be try to deal with the consequence i remember be in a high school in my own state as we be organize something we call the governor 's alliance against drugs and a young 16 year old girl come up to i desperate addicted dependent say governor i need help we be provide that young woman with help but i want to be a president of the united states who make sure that we never again do business with a drug run panamanian dictator that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convict drug dealer value begin at the top in the white house those be the value i want to bring to the presidency and to the white house begin in january of 1989

 lehrer governor a follow up question you have two minute to answer it be you suggest sir that president reagan be one of the cause of the drug problem in this country

 dukakis i be say that those of we who be elect to position of political leadership jim have a special responsibility not only to come up with program and i have outline in detail the very important very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention and mr. bush be right the two go hand in hand but if our government itself be do business with people who we know be engage in drug profiteering and drug trafficking if we do not understand that that send out a very very bad message to our young people it be a little difficult for i to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that i talk about and to young people like she all over the country and say to they we want to help you now i have outline in great detail a program for be tough on enforcement at home and abroad double the number of drug enforcement agent have a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of january when we bring our democratic neighbor and ally together here in this hemisphere and go to work together but we also have to take demand seriously you know we have 5 percent of the world 's population in this country we be consume 50 percent of the world 's cocaine and in my state i be proud to say we have organize a drug education and prevention program which the federal drug enforcement administration say be a model for the country we be help youngster we be reach out to they and we be begin with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grade in every elementary school in our state and that be the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the united states of america and we have get to begin early in the first second and third grade before our youngster begin to experiment with these very very dangerous substance i guess the question i would ask of mr. bush be how we instill those value how we create this environment for the drug free school that we want in this country if he or representative of the administration be either with or involve people like noriega in our foreign policy or do not pursue that connection in a way that make it possible for we to cut it off and to be an example to our kid all over the country

 lehrer a minute to rebut mr. vice president

 bush well the other day my opponent be give a briefing by the cia i ask for and receive the same briefing i be very careful in public life about deal with classified information and what i be about to say be unclassified seven administration be deal with mr. noriega it be the reagan bush administration that bring this man to justice and as the governor of massachusetts know there be no evidence that governor that mr. noriega be involve in drug no hard evidence until we indict he and so i think it be about time we get this noriega matter in perspective panama be a friendly country i go down there and talk to the president of panama about clean up their money laundering and mr. noriega be there but there be no evidence at that time and when the evidence be there we indict he and we want to bring he to justice and so call off all those picket out there that be try to tear down seven different administration

 lehrer all right the next question will be ask by john mashek it go to governor dukakis and you will have two minute to answer

 mashek governor dukakis another troublesome issue for voter this year be the bulge federal deficit in a dukakis administration you say taxis will be raise only as a last resort would you identify for we then please three specific program that you be willing to cut to bring that deficit down

 dukakis yes i have be very specific about those john and let i lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down because as a chief executive that be balance ten budget in a row i have have to make those tough decision and those tough choice

 first i have suggest that there be certain weapon system which we do not need and we can not afford mr. bush have be critical of i for that but i think those be the kind of tough choice you have to make i have also suggest that there be weapon system that we should proceed on and i have outline those in detail

 secondly we have get to invest in economic growth in this country in every part of this country build that kind of growth expand revenue and help to bring down that deficit

 thirdly we have to bring interest rate down and we will as we come up with a good solid plan with the congress for bring that deficit down

 and finally we have get to go out there and collect billion and billion of dollar in taxis owe that be not be pay to this country it be very unfair to the average taxpayer who pay his taxis and pay they on time to permit these monie to go uncollected i have also suggest that on the domestic side there be area where we can make some cut we ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that give our farm family a fair price and a decent future without spend $ 20 to $ 25 billion a year which be what we have be do under this administration we can help people to live well life and at the same time save money by help hundred of thousand of family on welfare to get off or welfare and to become productive citizen again

 the thing i do not understand about mr. bush 's approach to this be how he could possibly be serious about bring that deficit down give what he say he want to do he seem to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system he say he be against new taxis although he be break that pledge at least time in the last year that i know of he want to give the wealthy taxpayer in this country a five year $ 40 billion tax break he also want to spend a lot of money on additional program if he keep this up he be go to be the joe isuzu of american politic

 dukakis but i hope you will not take my five second away from i i will say this

 lehrer your two minute be up governor

 dukakis if he be serious about what he be say then the only place he can go to balance that budget be to raid the social security trust fund and he try that in 1985 and i think he be go to try it again

 lehrer you have a minute to rebut

 bush be this the time to unleash our one liner that answer be about as clear as boston harbor

 let i help the governor there be so many thing there i do not quite know where to begin when you cut capital gain you put people to work john kennedy propose cut capital gain paul tsongas a liberal senator from massachusetts say the dumb thing i do be to oppose the capital gain cut it be not go to cost the government money it be go to increase revenue to the federal government and it be go to create job so that be one of the thing that i think make a big difference between we massachusetts do not have an enormous defense budget but nevertheless the governor raise taxis five different time that happen to be a fact and so let us kind of stay on the issue and i have make a specific proposal for what i call a flexible freeze and it permit economist on the east coast and west think it be good it permit the president to sort out the priority and we continue to grow because i will not raise taxis

 lehrer your time be up too a follow up john

 mashek mr. vice president you have vow not to raise taxis of any kind during your administration and at the same time you have propose this capital gain cut you have propose more incentive break for the oil industry you have suggest new spending program and even some republicans say the flexible freeze you just speak about will hardly make a dent in the deficit be the deficit no long really a concern of your the republican party or the taxpayer

 bush i think it be the republican party and my concern to bring it down and presidential leadership that i want to provide in this area will bring it down but we have get to get the democrats congress under control they do all the spending they appropriate every dime and tell we how to spend every dime i would like to ask the governor to join in get for the president what 43 governor have the line item veto he have to operate in massachusetts under a balanced budget proviso i would like a balanced budget amendment but the dynamic of the economy we cut the taxis and revenue be up by 25 percent in three year so the problem be it be not that the working be be tax too little or the person work out the woman work in some factory be tax too little it be that we be continue to spend too much so my formula say grow at the rate of inflation permit the president to set the priority on where we do the spending and remember the federal deficit have come down $ 70 billion in one year in 1987

 and if we and the actually this year congress be do a little well in control the growth of spending spending be only up something like 4 percent so it be not that we be take too little from taxpayer we be spend too much still and the formula i have give you work we have put it through a good economic model we have get good economist on the west coast michael boskin and marty feldstein up there who be a very respected economist in the massachusetts and they agree that if we can do what i have say we can get it down without go and sock the american taxpayer once again capital gain one more point on that please let us learn from history a capital gain differential will increase job increase risk taking increase revenue to the federal government

 lehrer governor you have a minute to rebut

 dukakis well i hope all of those americans out there who be watch we listen to we and try to make up their mind about which one of we ought to be president of the united states listen to the vice president very carefully what he be propose after over a trillion in new debt which have be add in the federal debt in the course of the past eight year an iou our child and grandchild will be pay for year be a tax cut for the wealthy 1 percent of the people in this country an average of about $ 30,000 that we be go to give to people make $ 200,000 a year why that be more than the average teacher make

 we have have enough of that lady and gentleman we have run up more debt in the last eight year than under all the president from george washington to jimmy carter combine it be time for a chief executive who can make tough choice can work with the congress can get that deficit down and begin to build a strong fiscal foundation under this country

 lehrer all right the next question will be ask by anne groer and it will go the vice president you have two minute to answer sir

 groer mr. vice president you have say you want a kind gentler presidency one that help the less fortunate today 37 million americans include many work family with age parent and young child can not afford any health insurance but earn too much to qualify for medicaid what will you do to provide protection for they and how will you pay for it

 bush one thing i will not do be sock every business in the country and thus throw some people out of work i want to keep this economic recovery go more americans at work today than any time in history a great percentage of the work force

 what i will do be permit people to buy into medicaid i believe that be the answer i be proud to have be part of an administration that past the first catastrophic health bill and in that there be some medicaid provision that will be very helpful to the very kind of people we be talk about here but we have get to keep go forward without kill off the engine and throw people out of work so the answer lie it seem to i in full enforcement of the catastrophic program it lie to i in flexibility in medicaid so people at the low end can buy in there and get their need cover and then it also i do not want to see we mandate across the board that every company have to do this because i really think that marginal operator be go to go say we can not make it and i think then you be go to see that people be put out of work all these program and this cost on his be be i see an estimate i would love to know what he think $ 35–$40 billion and it seem to i that somebody pay that there be not any such thing as something free out there it either get pass along as increase price or it get pass along by people be put out of work so the business can continue to compete so i think we ought to do it in the medicaid system i think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance i think we ought to do it by everybody do what they can do out of conscience it be a terrible problem in term of flexibility on private insurance but i just do not want to mandate it and risk put this set the recovery back

 lehrer a rebuttal governor

 dukakis but george that be no answer

 bush you do not like the answer but it be an answer

 dukakis well no it be no answer to those 37 million people most of they member of work family who do not have a dime of health insurance and do not know how to pay the bill if their kid get sick at night i be in houston on tuesday meeting with a group of good citizen work citizen all of they with little or no health insurance one of they be a father who have be lay off a few month ago and lose his health insurance have an 11 year old son and can not let that son compete in sport and little league because he be afraid he be go to get hurt and he will not be able to provide health insurance to pay those bill my state just become the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and we do it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state the fact of the matter be that employer who today be insure their employee be pay the freight because they be pay for those who be not and i think it be time that when you get a job in this country it come with health insurance that be the way we be go to provide basic health security for all of the citizen of this country of our

 lehrer follow up anne

 groer yes since your massachusetts health plan have be attack by the vice president and you have defend it in this way i would like to move on to perhaps one of the most costly medical catastrophe face americans today and that be aids in at the end of september the thousand of aids patient will lose their access to azt which be the only federally approve drug for treatment of the disease now i would like to now sir if what your position be on extend that and what it be you think the government ought to be do about make azt and other drug available to people who be suffer from this disease

 dukakis well anne let i just say before i answer your question that i do not know that the vice president attack our program in massachusetts i hope he have not because have win the support of a great many people all over the state and i think it be a model for what i hope we can do across the country but when i propose my plan this past tuesday he or one of his spokesman call it socialize medicine the last time the vice president use that phrase i suspect he remember it do not you it be in 1964 and that be what he call medicare well he be wrong then and he be wrong now

 lehrer if i may interrupt at this point and caution the audience as i do before we go on the air please hold it down you be only take time away from your candidate when you do that governor continue please

 dukakis let i say this about aids it be the single most important public health crisis single most important public health emergency we have have in our lifetime and i think there be a number of thing we have to do include support legislation which be now move through the congress which will commit this nation to the resource to find a cure which will provide broad education and prevention which will provide sensitive and care treatment for the victim of aids i think we have to demonstrate some flexibility and i think the fda be attempt to do so now in try to make it possible for new and experimental drug to be available to people who be at risk at aids and i would hope that we could bring that kind of a policy to bear begin in january and i would encourage the current administration to proceed with that kind of flexibility where it be appropriate and where it be do carefully and responsibly but we have not have the kind of leadership we should have have in this particular area i think the vice president and i be in general agreement on what we have to do the special federal commission make good solid recommendation i think we be both supportive of they and i would strongly lead in that area as i have in my state as governor

 lehrer mr. vice president a minute of rebuttal

 bush well we be on the right track the nih be do a good job in research the surgeon general be do a good job in encourage the proper kind of education i notice that the governor do not mention any testing but we get to have a knowledge base testing should be confidential but we have to have a knowledge we can not simply stick our head in the sand in term of testing i be chairman of the president 's task force on regulatory relief and we be work with the fda and they have speed up bring drug to market that can help and you got to be careful here because there be a safety factor but i think these thing and then also i be one who believe we have get to go the extra mile in clean be sure that that blood supply be pure we can not have a lack of confidence in the blood supply when it come to operation and surgery and thing of this nature so research speed the drug to market testing blood supply be very important element of this

 lehrer next question will be ask by peter jennings it go to the governor

 jennings good evening mr. vice president governor governor one theme that keep come up about the way you govern you have both mention leadership tonight so i would like to stay with that for a second the theme that keep come up about the way you govern be passionless technocratic

 dukakis passionless

 jennings passionless technocratic the smart clerk in the world your critic maintain that in the 1960 your public passion be not the war in vietnam or civil right but no fault auto insurance and they say in the 1970 you play virtually no role in the painful busing crisis in boston give the fact that a president must sometimes lead by sheer inspiration and passion we need to know if this be a fair portrait of your governing or if it be a stereotype and if it be not fair give we an example of where you have have that passion and leadership that sometimes a president need

 dukakis peter i care deeply about people all people work people working family people all over this country who in some case be live from paycheck to paycheck in other case be have a hard time open up the door of college opportunity to their child in other case do not have basic health insurance which for most of we we accept as a matter of course and assume we be go to have in order to pay the bill that we incur when we get sick i be somebody who believe deeply in genuine opportunity for every single citizen in this country and that be the kind of passion i bring to my state i be a leader in the civil right movement in my state and in my legislature i care very deeply about that war in vietnam i think it be a mistake i think it be wrong and i be one of the few legislator early in that war that take a stand against the war i think it be the right stand at the time and i think history have prove we to be correct but i have learn over time i serve one term i be defeat as you know and defeat sometimes be an important lesson i think i be a much well governor today i think i be a much well person a much well listener i think i will be a much well president for having go through that experience but the thing that we have do in my state to bring opportunity to people on public assistance over 50,000 family on welfare that we have help to move from welfare to work and to become productive citizen the universal health care bill that we just talk about which will guarantee health care for all of our citizen the opening up of opportunity to minority in my state affirmative action minority contracting the fact that we have a 3 percent unemployment rate and more job than people to fill they which give we a tremendous opportunity to reach out to everybody and make they a part of this wonderful nation of our with the opportunity that we create

 these be thing that i believe in very very deeply i may be a little calm than some about it i may be a great consensus builder these day than i use to be and i think that be a good thing but i be run for the presidency of the united states i have be in public service for 25 year because i believe deeply in american goal and value and the people of this country and that be the kind of president i want to be

 lehrer mr. vice president a rebuttal

 bush well i do not question his passion i question and i do not question his concern about the war in vietnam he introduce or support legislation back then that suggest that kid of massachusetts should be exempt from go overseas in that war now that be a certain passion that in my view it be misguided passion he we have a big difference on issue you see last year in the primary he express his passion he say i be a strong liberal democrat august 87 then he say i be a card carry member of the aclu that be what he say he be out there on out of the mainstream he be very passionate my argument with the governor be do we want this country to go that far left and i wish we have time to let i explain but i salute he for his passion we just have a big difference on where this country should be lead and in what direction it ought to go

 lehrer peter a question question for the vice president peter

 jennings i would actually like to follow up if i may on this mention you have make of his card carry membership in the american civil liberties union you have use the phrase card carry so many time since governor dukakis first acknowledge that he be a card carry member of the aclu that some people have come to believe that you have use it to brand he in some way to identify he as people be identify in the 1950 as less than patriotic i would like to know why you keep repeat the phrase and what be the important issue here what be so wrong with the governor be a member of an organization which have come to the defense of among other people colonel oliver north

 bush nothing be wrong with it but just take a look at the position of the aclu but peter please understand the liberal do not like i talk about liberal they do not like it when i say that he say he be a card carry member now if that quote be wrong he can repudiate it right here i have see it authoritatively write twice and if i have do he an injustice and he do not say it i be very very sorry but i do not agree with a lot of most of the position of the aclu i simply do not want to see the rating on movie i do not want my 10 year old grandchild to go into an x rate movie i like those rating system i do not think they be right to try to take the tax exemption away from the catholic church i do not want to see the kiddie pornographic law repeal i do not want to see under god come out from our currency now these be all position of the aclu and i do not agree with they he have every right to exercise his passion as what he say a strong progressive liberal i do not agree with that i come from a different point and i think i be more in touch with the mainstream of america they raise the same thing with i on the pledge of allegiance you see i would have find a way to sign that bill governor thompson of illinois do i be not question his patriotism he go out and say the man be question my patriotism and then all the liberal columnist join in i be not i be question his judgment on these matter or where he be come from he have every right to do it but i believe that be not what the american people want and when he say when he say at the convention ideology do not matter just competence he be move away from his own record from what his passion have be over the year and that be all i be try to do be put it in focus and i hope people do not think that i be question his patriotism when i say he use his word to describe his participation in that organization

 lehrer governor a response

 dukakis well i hope this be the first and last time i have to say this of course the vice president be question my patriotism i do not think there be any question about that and i resent it i resent it my parent come to this country as immigrant they teach i that this be the great country in the world i be in public service because i love this country i believe in it and nobody be go to question my patriotism as the vice president have now repeatedly the fact of the matter be if the pledge of allegiance be the acid test of one 's patriotism the vice president be be the preside officer in the united states senate for the past seven and a half year to the good of my knowledge he be never once suggest that a session of the senate begin with the pledge of allegiance

 mr. bush i do not question your patriotism when you be attack for your military record i immediately say it be inappropriate it have no place in this campaign and i reject it i would hope that from this point on we get to the issue that affect the vast majority of americans job school health care housing the environment those be the concern of the people that be watch we tonight not label that we attach to each other question about each other 's patriotism and loyalty

 lehrer the time be up governor let us go now to john mashek again a question for the vice president

 mashek mr. vice president in a debate during the republican primary you say most of the nation 's homeless be suffer from mental illness an assertion immediately challenge by one of your rival estimate of the homeless range from a low of 250,000 by the government to around three million include work family and their child what commitment be you willing to make tonight to this voiceless segment of our society

 bush i want to see the mckinney act fully fund i believe that that would help in term of shelter i want to see when i talk at our convention about a thousand point of light i be talk about the enormous number of shelter and organization that help

 the governor 's wife have be very active in the homeless my campaign chairman secretary jim baker 's wife this be not government these be people that care that be try to give of themselves the government have a role it be to fully fund the mckinney act there be certain army basis that the act call for that can be use in certain case to shelter people when it be rough

 and so i think that we be on the right track i do not see this incidentally as a democrat or a republican or a liberal or conservative idea i see an involvement by a thousand point of light i see the funding that be require and i hope the congress will fully fund this bill they give it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work and we be on the track on this one but and i look mental that be a little overstated it i would say around 30 percent and i think maybe we could look back over our shoulder and wonder whether it be right to let all those mental patient out maybe we need to do a well job in mental clinic to help they because there be a major problem there a lot of they be mentally sick and we have get to attend to they but fully my short range answer be fully fund that mckinney act

 lehrer governor a response

 dukakis well this be another fundamental difference that i have with the vice president just as i do in the case of health care for 37 million member of work family in this country who do not have health insurance

 the problem mr. bush be that you have cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for family of low and moderate income and when you do that you have have homeless family

 we do not have two and a half million or three million homeless people live on street and in doorway in this country ten year ago we have get to begin to get back to the business of build and rehabilitate housing for family of low and moderate income in this country housing for young family that they can look forward some day to buy we have get community in this country increasingly where our own kid can not afford to live in the community that they grow up in that be an essential commitment and i think the housing community be ready but it be go to take a president who be commit to housing who be have experience in building and rehabilitate housing who understand that affordable housing for family of low and moderate income for young family first time home buyer be an essential part of the american dream and while i be all for the mckinney bill that by itself simply will not do we have get to have a president that can lead on this issue that can work with the congress and i be prepared to do so this be one of the most important priority that face this country

 lehrer john a question for the governor

 mashek governor you have mention the american dream of home ownership and it be certainly become an impossible one for many of the young people of our nation who be catch up in this economic squeeze of the middle class as you have say so frequently during the campaign and yet in spite of your answer just a few minute ago what promise can you realistically hold out to these people that with the cost of housing go up and with limited help available from washington be we destine to become a nation of renter

 dukakis well i certainly hope not and it be all a question of what our priority be mr. bush talk about value i agree with he what be our value be not provide housing for family of low and moderate income be not it make possible for young family first time home buyer to own their own home some day something that be part of the american dream i think so you know back after world war ii when we have hundred of thousand of gi who come back from the war we do not sit around we go out and build housing the government be very much involve so be the housing industry so be the banking industry so be housing advocate so be non profit agency so be governor and mayor and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing now that be the kind of leadership that i want to provide as president of the united states this be not a question of a little charity for the homeless this be a question of organize the housing community i have talk to banker and builder and developer the housing advocate community development agency and they want leadership from washington washington by itself can not do it all we should not expect that but governor be ready mayor be ready builder and community leader be ready it will require some fund john and we ought to be prepared to provide those fund

 but that too will require some choice mr. bush want to spend billion and trillion on star wars well that be a choice we have to make be not it do we spend money on that weapon system in the billion and trillion or be provide some decent and affordable housing for family of this country something that be at least as important and probably more so because it be so essential to our economic strength and to our future now that be the kind of presidency i believe in and simply to say well the mckinney bill will do it just do not do we need a president who will lead on this issue who have have experience on this issue it be the kind of priority that will be at the top of our list begin in january of 1989

 lehrer a response mr. vice president

 bush i think the governor be blur housing and the homeless let us talk about housing which the question be when you talk to those banker do they discuss where interest rate be when your party control the white house ten day before i take the oath of office as president they be 21 1/2 percent now how do that grab you for increase housing

 housing be up we be serve a million more family now but we be not go to do it in that old democratic liberal way of try to build more brick and mortar go out and take a look at st. louis at some of that effort it be wrong i favor home ownership i want to see more voucher i want to see control of some of these project and i want to keep the interest rate down they be half now of what they be when we come into office and with my policy of get this deficit under control they will be a lot less

 but if we spend and spend and spend that be go to wrap up the housing market and we will go right back to the day of the misery index and malaise that president reagan and i have overcome thank god for the united states on that one

 lehrer all right the next question be to the governor ann groer will ask it

 groer governor dukakis be there a conflict between your opposition to the death penalty and your support for abortion on demand even though in the mind of many people that be also kill

 dukakis no i do not think there be there be two very different issue here and they have get to be deal with separately i be oppose to the death penalty i think everybody know that i be also very tough on violent crime and that be one of the reason why my state have cut crime by more than any other industrial state in america it be one of the reason why we have the low murder rate of any industrial state in the country it be one of the reason why we have a drug education and prevention program that be reach out and help youngster all over our state the kind of thing i want to do as president of the united states

 you know the vice president say he want to impose the death penalty on drug trafficker and yet his administration have a federal furlough program which be one of the most permissive in the country which give last year 7,000 furlough to drug trafficker and drug pusher the same people that he say he now want to execute

 the issue of abortion be a very difficult issue one that i think that we all have to wrestle with we have to come to term with i do not favor abortion i do not think it be a good thing i do not think most people do the question be who make the decision and i think it have to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious belief that make that decision

 lehrer response mr. vice president

 bush well the massachusetts furlough program be unique it be the only one in the nation that furlough murderer who have not serve enough time to be eligible for parole the federal program do not do that no other state program do that and i favor the death penalty i know it be tough and honest people can disagree but when a narcotic wrap up guy go in and murder a police officer i think they ought to pay with their life and i do believe it would be inhibit and so i be not go to furlough man like willie horton and i would meet with their the victim of his last escapade the rape and the brutalization of the family down there in maryland maryland would not extradite willie horton the man who be furlough the murderer because they do not want he to be furlough again and so we have a fundamental difference on this one and i think most people know my position on the sanctity of life i favor adoption i do not favor abortion

 lehrer question for the vice president ann

 groer yes mr. vice president i would like to stay with abortion for just a moment if i might over the year you have express several position while oppose nearly all form of government payment for it you now say that you support abortion only in case of rape incest or threat to a mother 's life and you also support a constitutional amendment that if ratify would outlaw most abortion but if abortion be to become illegal again do you think that the woman who defy the law and have they anyway as they do before it be okay by the supreme court and the doctor who perform they should go to jail

 bush i have not sort out the penalty but i do know i do know that i oppose abortion and i favor adoption and if we can get this law change everybody should make the extraordinary effort to take these kid that be unwanted and sometimes abort take the let they come to birth and then put they in a family where they will be love and you see yes my position have evolve and it be continue to evolve and it be evolve in favor of life and i have have a couple of exception that i support rape incest and the life of the mother sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talk about this but it be much clear for i now as i have see abortion sometimes use as a birth control device for heaven sake see the million of these killing accumulate and this be one where you can have an honest difference of opinion we certainly do but no i be for the sanctity of life and once that illegality be establish then we can come to grip with the penalty side and of course there be get to be some penalty to enforce the law whatever they may be

 lehrer governor

 dukakis well i think what the vice president be say be that he be prepared to brand a woman a criminal for make this decision it be as simple as that i do not think it be enough to come before the american people who be watch we tonight and say well i have not sort it out this be a very very difficult and fundamental decision that all of we have to make and what he be say if i understand he correctly be that he be prepared to brand a woman a criminal for make this choice

 bush i just

 dukakis let i finish let i simply say that i think it have to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious belief that make that decision and i think that be the right approach the right decision and i would hope by this time that mr. bush have sort out this issue and come to term with it as i have i respect his right to disagree with i but i think it be important that we have a position that we take it and we state it to the american people

 lehrer peter jennings a question for the vice president

 jennings mr. vice president i be strike by your discussion of woman and the sanctity of life and it lead i to recall your own phrase that you be haunt by the life which child in our inner city live certainly the evidence be compelling there be an explosion of single parent family and by any measure these single parent family many with unwanted child be the source of poverty school drop out crime which many people in the inner city simply feel be out of control if it haunt you so why over the eight year of the reagan bush administration have so many program design to help the inner city be eliminate or cut

 bush one of the reason and i first would like to know which program you be talk about and then we could talk on the merit of the program but you see my fundamental philosophy be give local and state government as much control as possible that might be the explanation if you tell i the program i do strongly support the wic program i think it be good i think part of the answer to this haunting of these child that be out there and suffer lie in extension of medicaid to challenge the state and maybe we be go to have to enforce more on the state in term of medicaid take care of these

 but peter so much of it be get into a whole other phase of thing the neighborhood the kind of environment people be grow up in and that lead i to the program i be talk about in term of education i think that part of it be the crime infest neighborhood and that be why i be a strong believer in try to control crime in the neighborhood why i be so pleased to be endorse by the policeman on the beat the boston police department the other day i think they understand my commitment to help they in the neighborhood

 and so it be a combination of these thing but do not erode out of the system the thousand point of light the people that be out there try to help these kid the program like city and school the work that barbara bush be do so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty i be for head start and move that up and i have already make a proposal and yes it will cost some money but i favor that so these be the combination of thing i want and the fact that i do not think the federal government can endorse a $ 35 billion program do not mean i have less compassion than the person who endorse such a program

 lehrer governor

 dukakis well i must have be live through a different eight year then the one the vice president 's be live through because this administration have cut and slash and cut and slash program for child for nutrition for the kind of thing that can help these youngster to live well life it be cut federal aid to education it be cut pell grant and loan to close the door to college opportunity on youngster all over this country and that too be a major difference between the vice president and i

 let i just give you one other example we have a great many people hundred of thousand of people live on public assistance in this country the 50 governor of this nation have propose to the congress that we help those family to get off of welfare help those youngster help their mother to become independent and self sufficient it be take month and month and month to get mr. bush and the administration to support that legislation and they be still resist that be the way you help people be haunt a thousand point of light i do not know what that mean i know what strong political leadership be i know what be happen over the course of the past eight year these program have be cut and slash and butcher and they have hurt kid all over this country

 lehrer a question for the governor peter

 jennings governor the crisis be no less a crisis for you if you be elect president where would you get the money to devote to the inner city which be clearly need and can you be specific about the program not only you would reinstate but the more imaginative one that you would begin

 dukakis well i say a few minute ago peter that you could improve the life of family and youngster and save money at the same time welfare reform be one way to do it if we invest in job training in child care for those youngster in some extend health benefit so that that mother and her kid do not lose their health benefit when she go to work we can help literally hundred of thousand if not million of family to get off of welfare to become independent and self sufficient to be taxpaye citizen and to improve their life the quality of life their future and the future of those child

 that be just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time in my own state for example we now have that universal health care system which the vice president oppose i think very unwisely one of the great barrier to opportunity for a family and for those child be the threat that they mat lose their health insurance think about that father down there in houston who have to tell his youngster that he can not play little league ball that he can not go out on the ball field because he be afraid he be go to get hurt

 and yet mr. bush say well i do not think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employee when responsible employer a majority of employer in this country do and be pay more for their insurance to reimburse hospital for free care on account of people that be not insure that have to go to that hospital

 so these be the way that you help family you help youngster to live well life and more decent life be ready to go to work at the state and local level all of we i know the private sector be people be all over the country but it take presidential leadership it take a commitment to be involve and the leading and that be the kind of presidency i want to lead

 lehrer mr. vice president

 bush what trouble i be that when i talk of the voluntary sector and a thousand point of light and a thousand different way to help on these problem the man have just say he do not understand what i be talk about

 this be the problem i have with the big spending liberal they think the only way to do it be for the federal government to do it all the fact happen to be that education spending be up by the federal government it be up it be not down

 but here be the point he miss the federal government spend 7 percent of the total on education and the rest of the state government and local government and the thousand point of lightened i be talk about private school and private church school and thing of this nature be put up 93 percent

 but the federal spending for education be up and i want to be the education president because i want to see we do well we be put more money per child into education and we be not perform as we should we have get away fro value and the fundamental and i would like to urge the school superintendent and the other around the country to stand up now and keep we move forward on a path towards real excellence

 and we can do it but it¹s not go to be dedicate by some federal bureaucracy in washington d.c.

 lehrer all right let us move now to some question on foreign and national security policy john mashek will ask the first question of the governor

 mashek governor the vice president continually refer to your lack of experience weakness naivete on foreign policy and national security matter he say you be prepared to eliminate weapon system that will result in the unilateral disarmament of this country be that true

 dukakis of course not of course that be a charge that be always make against any governor who run for the presidency i think it be one of the thing that mr. bush say about mr. reagan back in 1980 remember that george and yet some of our fine president some of our strong international leader be governor franklin roosevelt woodrow wilson theodore roosevelt

 its not the amount of time you spend in washington it be not the length of your resume it be your strength it be your value it be the quality of the people you pick it be your understanding of the force of change that be sweep the world and whether or not you be in a position to provide leadership to make those force of change work for we and not against we

 the vice president have a long resume but it do not stop he from endorse the sale of arm to the ayatollah and we now know that he be not out of the loop he be in meeting after meeting listen to secretary shultz and secretary weinberger oppose that and yet he support it

 his experience do not prevent he from participate or involve or in some way be involve in the relationship between this government and mr. noriega and drug trafficking in panama

 he go to philippines in the early 80 and commend ferdinand marcos for his commitment to democracy and he continue to support a fail policy in central america which be get bad and bad and which have in fact increase cuban and soviet influence in that region

 so i do not believe that the fact you have get that long resume or have that experience be the real question the question be value the question be strength the question be your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provide i be ready to provide that leadership i want to be the commander in chief of this country i think it take fresh leadership now and an understanding of those force of change to provide the kind of strength that we need and perhaps the vice president can explain what he be do when he support the trading of arm to terrorist nation and his involvement in panama and that endorsement of mr. macros but i do not think it be just experience that make the difference it be strength it be value

 lehrer mr. vice president

 bush well i think the question be about defense the governor be for a nuclear freeze that would have lock in a thousand soviet intermediate nuclear force weapon and zero for the west and because we do not listen to the freeze advocate and strengthen the defense of this country we now have the first arm control agreement in the nuclear age now we be sit down and talk to the soviets about strategic arm and he want to do away with the midgetman and the mx the modernization or our nuclear capability that be not the way you deal with the soviets i have meet mr. gorbachev met mr. shevardnadze and talk substance with he the other day these people be tough but now we have a chance i few have experience and now how to handle it but please do not go back to the day when the military be as weak as they could be when the morale be down and when we be the laugh stock around the world

 and now we be back because we have strengthen the defense of this country and believe i i do not want to see we return to those day

 as to ferdinand marcos he be not there any more it be under our administration that mrs. aquino come in but i will tell you what i be think of i fly a combat mission my last one be over manila and he be down there fight against imperialism and he have just

 lehrer mr. vice president

 bush and he just lift martial law and he just call for new election and all of those thing happen because the philippines do crave democracy and out he go

 lehrer mr. vice president your time be up john a question for the vice president

 mashek mr. vice president the governor have suggest that you have never meet a weapon system that you do not like or want be you prepared to tell the voter one system in this time of tight budgetary restraint and problem at the pentagon that you would be willing to cut or even eliminate that would not endanger national security

 bush i do not think it be a question of eliminate i can tell he some i be against a-6f for example divad and i can go on and on minuteman iii penetration system i mean there be plenty of they that i oppose but what i be not go to do when we be negotiate with the soviet union sit down talk to mr. gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapon i be not go to give away a couple of ace i that very tough card game i be simply not go to do that

 and under i when i lead this country the secretary of defense be go to have to make the choice between how we keep how we protect the survivability of our nuclear deployment on the midgetman missile or on the minuteman whatever it be we be go to have to the mx we be go to have to do that it be christmas

 bush would not it be nice to be perfect

 dukakis i hope it be not christmas when you make that decision

 bush would not it be nice to be the ice man so you never make a mistake these be the my answer be do not make these unilateral cut and everybody now realize that peace through strength work and so this be where i have a big difference

 of course we be go to have to make some determination on this and we be go to have to make it on the convention force but now we have get a very good concept call competitive strategy we will do what we do well it be a strategy that we have be work on for a couple of year it be go to take we to much well advantage in conventional force

 but look let i sum it up i want to be the president that get conventional force balance i want to be the one to banish chemical and biological weapon from the face of the earth but you have to have a little bit of experience to know where to start and i think i have have that

 lehrer governor

 dukakis well first let i say with respect to the freeze that back in the spring of 1982 mr. bush be a lot more sympathetic to the freeze than he seem to be today as a matter of fact he say it be not and should not be subject to partisan demagoguery because it be too important for the united states or for the world i do not hear john exactly where he be go to cut and what he be go to do

 but i know this we have serious financial problem in this country we have pile up over a trillion dollar in debt and the next president of the united states be go to have to make some choice

 mr. bush want to spend billion on star wars he apparently want to spend billion on the mx on railroad car a weapon system we do not need and can not afford i think the administration be oppose to the midgetman i think the administration be at the negotiating table in geneva suggest that we ban mobile missile system entirely but those be the choice the next president of the united states be go to have to make

 i be for the stealth i be for the d-5 i be for go ahead with the advance cruise missile but i do not think we need these other system i do not think we need they to remain strong we have get to move ahead with the strategic arm negotiation process with the comprehensive test ban treaty and with negotiation lead to conventional force reduction in europe with deep cut on the soviet side and senator bentsen and i will pursue that policy

 lehrer anne groer a question for the vice president

 groer well mr. vice president you say you have meet with secretary general gorbachev you have meet with mr. shevardnadze but for the last 40 year americans have be teach to regard the soviet union as the enemy yet president reagan have sign two arm control treaty and he be promise to share star wars technology with the very country he once call the evil empire so perhaps you can tell we this evening should we be do a lot to help the economic and the social development of a country that we have so long regard as an adversary

 bush what i think we ought to do be take a look at perestroika and glasnost welcome they but keep our eye open be cautious because the soviet change be not fully establish yet yes i think it be fine to do business with they and so i be encourage with what i see when i talk to mr. what i hear when i talk to mr. gorbachev and mr. shevardnadze but can they pull it off

 and when they have a they a deal that be good for we as china start to do the change in china since barbara and i live there be absolutely amazing in term of incentive in partnership and thing of this nature and now the soviet union seem to be walk down that same path we should encourage that we ought to say this be good

 but where i differ with my opponent be i be not go to make unilateral cut in our strategic defend system or support some freeze when they have superiority i be not go to do that because i think the jury be still out on the soviet experiment

 and the interesting place one of the thing that fascinate i about this perestroika and glasnost be wheat go to happen in eastern europe you see the turmoil in poland today and i think we have enormous opportunity for trade i do not want to go back to the carter grain embargo on the soviets we be once again reliable supplier and i would never use food as a political tool like our predecessor do but this be an exciting time but all i be suggest be let us not be naïve in deal with the soviets and make a lot of unilateral cut hope against hope that they will match our bid

 look at the inf treaty and if we have not learn from the negotiate history on that we will never learn the freeze people be wrong the reagan bush administration be right

 lehrer governor dukakis

 dukakis it be a very different george bush who be talk much more sympathetically about the freeze in the spring of 1982 than he be today and you be right then george when you say it be no time for partisan demagoguery nobody be suggest that we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength of course not what we be talk about be a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent strong well equip well train well maintain conventional force and at the same time a willingness to move forward steadily thoughtfully cautiously

 we have serious difference with the soviet union we have very fundamental difference about human right democracy and our basic system our basic view of human being and of what life be all about but there be opportunity there now senator bentsen and i have a plan for the 1990 and beyond mr. bush and mr. quayle do not

 and we want to pursue that plan in a way which will bring down the level of nuclear armament will build a more stable and more peaceful world while make choice here at home let us not forget that our national security and our economic security go hand in hand we can not be strong militarily when we be teeter tottering on top of a mountain of debt which have be create in the past eight year that be why we need a democratic administration in washington in 1989

 lehrer anne groer a question for the governor

 groer yes governor dukakis speak of seem change of position you have go from call the strategic defense initiative or star wars a fantasy and a fraud to say recently that you would continue sdi research and might even deploy the system if congress support such a move why the change of heart

 dukakis no there be be no change of heart i say from the beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic system at about the level that be add in 1983 that be about a billion dollar a year but i do not know of any reputable scientist who believe that this system at least as originally conceive could possibly work this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect we from enemy attack it make real sense and as a matter of fact the system that the administration be now talk about be very different from the one that be originally propose in 1983

 so i be for continued research but i also want strong conventional force now the other day mr. bush say well if we continue with star war star war we have to cut some place he have not tell we where we know where they be cut we know where you be cut right now you be cut into the fiber and muscle of our conventional force you be cut back on maintenance and equipment

 an air force general not too long ago in europe who say that pretty soon we would have airplane without engine tank commander who can not drive their tank more than three quarter of a mile because they do not have enough fuel coast guard cutter tie up at the dock this summer not patrol they be suppose to be our first line of defense against drug and the war against drug because they do not have enough fuel

 you have to make choice we be not make those choice and to spend billion and billion of dollar as mr. bush apparently want to although he himself have be all over the lot on this issue lately on star wars in my judgment make no sense at all we need a strong credible effective nuclear deterrent we have 13,000 strategic nuclear warhead right now on land on sea and in the air enough to blow up the soviet union 40 time over they have about 12,000 so we have get to move forward with those negotiation get the level of strategic weapon down

 but to continue to commit billion to this system make no sense at all and i think mr. bush have be reconsider his position over the course of the past few week that's at least that be what i read maybe he will tell we where he stand on it tonight

 lehrer mr. vice president

 bush i be not reconsider my position two question how do you deter nuclear attack without modernize our nuclear force when the soviets be modernize and how come you spend willing to spend a dime on something that you consider a fantasy and a fraud those be two hypo rhetorical question

 he be the man on conventional force that want to eliminate two carrier battle group the armed force the conventional force of the united states have never be more ready every single one of the joint chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness be in an historic high and secondly in term of the cutting of the coast guard the democratic control congress so please help we with that who cut $ 70 million from the coast guard out of the interdiction effort on narcotic

 he be get to get this thing more clear why do you spend a billion dollar on something you think be a fantasy and a fraud i will fully research it go forward as fast as we can we have set up the level of funding and when it be deployable i will deploy it that be my position on sdi and it be never waver a bit

 lehrer peter jennings a question for governor dukakis

 jennings well governor and vice president bush you have both talk tonight about hard choice let i try to give you one somewhere in the middle east tonight nine americans be be hold hostage if you be commander in chief and americans be hold hostage what will be more important to you their individual fate or the commitment that the united states government must never negotiate with terrorist and if any americans be hold hostage and you become president to what length would you go to rescue they

 dukakis peter it be one of the most agonizing decision a president have to make these be american citizen we care deeply about they their family care deeply about they want they back and understandably so and we want to do everything we can to bring they back

 but if there be one thing we also understand it be that you can not make concession to terrorist ever ever because if you do it be an open invitation to other terrorist to take hostage and to blackmail we and that be the tragedy of the iran contra scandal

 as a matter of fact mr. bush be the chairman of a task force on international terrorism which issue a report shortly before that decision be make and say and rightly so that we never ever can make concession to terrorist and hostage taker and yet after sit through meeting after meeting he endorse that decision endorse the sale of arm to the ayatollah in exchange for hostage one of the most tragic one of the most mistaken foreign policy decision we have ever make in this country and i dare say encourage other to take hostage as we now know

 so there can be no concession under any circumstance because if we do it be an open invitation to other to do the same we have get to be tough on international terrorism we have get to treat it as international crime we have get to attack at all point we have go to use undercover operation we have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camp we have to work closely with our ally to make sure that they be work with we and we with they and we can give no quarter when it come to break the back of international terrorism

 yes we should make every effort to try to help those hostage come home but it can never be because we make concession that be a tragic mistake that we make a mistake that mr. bush make and other make and it should never ever be make again

 lehrer mr. vice president

 bush i write the anti terrorist report for this government it be the good anti terrorist report write yes we should not trade arm for hostage but we have make vast improvement in our anti terrorism now it be fine to say that sometimes you have to hit base camp but when the president see this state sponsor fingerprint of muammar khadaffi on the loss of american life he hit libya and my opponent be unwilling to support that action

 dukakis that be not true that be not true

 bush and since that action terrorist action against the united states citizen have go down

 dukakis that be not true

 bush and i have long ago say i support the president on this other matter and i have say mistake be make clearly nobody be go to think the president start out think he be go to trade arm for hostage that be a very serious charge against the president the matter have be thoroughly look into but the point be sometimes the action have to be take by the federal government and when we take action it have a favorable response

 lehrer a question for the vice president peter

 jennings it seem perhaps a good subject mr. vice president on which to make the point that you have campaign vigorously as part of a leadership team but so far you will not tell the american people in considerable measure what advice you give the president include the sale of arm to iran and what should have be do about the hostage to the good of my knowledge there be no constitutional requirement which prevent you from do so jimmy carter urge his vice president walter mondale to tell the american people would you now ask president reagan for permission to tell the american people what advice you do give he and if you do not how do we judge your judgment in the oval office in the last eight year

 bush you be judge by the whole record you be judge by the entire record be we close to peace be we do well in anti terrorism should we have listen to my opponent who want to send the un into the persian gulf or in spite of the mistake of the past be we do well there how be our credibility with the gcc country on the western side of the gulf be iran talk to iraq about peace you judge on the record be the soviets come out of afghanistan how do it look in a program he call or some one of these marvelous boston adjective up there and about angola now we have a chance several bostonians do not like it but the rest of the country will understand

 now we have a chance now we have a chance and so i think that i would leave it right there and say that you judge on the whole record and let i say this all he can talk about he go around rant about noriega now i have tell you what the intelligence briefing he receive say about that he can talk about iran contra and also i'll make a deal with you i will take the blame for those two incident if you give i half the credit for all the good thing that have happen in world peace since ronald reagan and i take over from the carter administration

 i still have a couple of minute leave and there be a difference principle

 lehrer sorry mr. vice president

 bush it be only on yellow here wait a minute

 lehrer i be wrong go ahead my apology

 bush jim

 lehrer you say nobody be perfect

 bush i say i be not perfect where be i

 dukakis 25th of december mr. vice president

 bush i finish

 dukakis he can have another ten second if he want jim

 lehrer governor you have a minute to respond

 dukakis well the matter of judgment be very important and i think it be important to understand what happen here

 a report on international terrorism chair by the vice president be release and make some very specific recommendation about how to deal with terrorism they be ignore the vice president ignore they he say mistake be make very serious mistake in judgment be make he say well let us concede that the administration have be do business with noriega have make he a part of our foreign policy and have be funnel aid to contras through convict drug dealer

 i think those be very very serious question of judgment which those of you who be watch we here tonight have a right to judge and review we be not go to make those kind of mistake you can not make concession to terrorist if you do you invite the taking of more hostage that be a basic principle it be ignore in that case and it be a very very serious mistake in judgment

 lehrer a question from john mashek it go to the vice president

 mashek mr. vice president democrats and even some republicans be still express reservation about the qualification and credential of senator dan quayle of indiana your choose running mate to be a heartbeat away from the presidency what do you see in he that other do not

 bush i see a young man that be elect to the senate twice to the house of representatives twice i see a man who be young and i be put my confidence in a whole generation of people that be in their 30 and 40 i see a man that take the leadership in the job training partnership act and that retrain people in this highly competitive change society we be in so if a person lose his hob he be retrain for a benefit for a work that will be productive and he will not have to go on one of these many program that the liberal talk about

 i see a young man who be a knowledgeable in defense and there be three people on our ticket that be knowledgeable in the whole in the race knowledgeable in defense and dan quayle be one of they and i be one of they and i believe that he will be outstanding and he take a tremendous pounding and everybody now know that he take a very unfair pounding and i would like each person to say do i jump to conclusion run down rumor that be so outrageous and so brutal and he be keep his head up and he will do very very well and he have my full confidence and he will have the confidence of people that be in their 30 and 40 and more so judge the man on his record not on the lot of rumor and innuendo and try to fool around with his name

 my opponent say j. danforth quayle do you know who j. danforth be he be a man who give his life in world war ii so ridicule a person 's name be a little beneath this process and he will do very well when we get into the debate

 dukakis well when it come to ridicule george you win a gold medal i think we can agree on that in the course of this campaign

 bush just the fact

 dukakis but do i do i sense a desire that maybe lloyd bentsen ought to be your running mate when you say there be three people on your ticket

 bush no i think the debate ought to be between you and lloyd

 dukakis i think the american people have a right to judge we on this question on how we pick a running mate a person who be a heartbeat away from the presidency i pick lloyd bentsen distinguish strong mature a leader in the senate somebody whose qualification nobody have question mr. bush pick dan quayle

 i doubt very much that dan quayle be the well qualified person for that job and as a matter of fact i think for most people the notion of president quayle be a very very troubling thought

 lehrer john will ask a question of the governor it will be the last question and then the vice president will have a rebuttal

 mashek well governor you do select lloyd bentsen of texas

 dukakis i do indeed

 mashek and you have a lot of disagreement with he on fundamental issue include the reagan tax cut aid to the rebel in nicaragua the death penalty gun control who be right

 dukakis well john i be a man that be be a chief executive for ten year i have pick a lot of people i have pick cabinet i have name judge i know that the people you pick make an enormous difference in your ability to govern and i set high standard i try to meet they and i insist that people who work for i meet they if they do not they do not stick around very long

 but i do not pick lloyd bentsen because he be a clone of mike dukakis i pick he because he be somebody who would be a strong vice president somebody who would be an active vice president somebody who would come to i if somebody come up with a crazy idea that we ought to trade arm to the ayatollah for hostage and say mr. president that be wrong we should not do that that be the kind of vice president i want

 he himself have say and rightly so that he will be a strong vice president when the vice president make a decision that will be his decision and i be very very proud of that choice and i do not pick he because he agree with i on everything

 you know sam rayburn once say that if two people agree on everything then only one person be do the thinking the fact be i have pick somebody who not only will be a great vice president but if god forbid something happen to the president could step into that office and do so with distinction and with strength and with leadership i doubt very much i doubt very much that mr. bush 's selection for the vice presidency of the united states meet that test

 lehrer mr. vice president

 bush well i we obviously have a difference i believe it do meet the test we will have an opportunity to see the two of they in action in a friendly forum wonderful friendly fashion like this

 i have hope this have be a little friendly evening i want to hitchhike a ride home in his tank with he but now we have get the line too carefully draw here but you talk about judgment i mean what kind of judgment i mean jump all over the president on his decision on one area of farm policy what kind of judgment sense have your chief education adviser now in jail in massachusetts i mean there's i do not think this be a fair argument but nevertheless i support my nominee for vice president and he will do an outstanding job

 lehrer gentleman i be give some bad word a moment ago there be time for one more question get it in my ear and ann groer will ask it ann to the governor

 groer governor dukakis as many u.s. farmer face or undergo foreclosure the united states be consider the possibility of forgive a certain percentage of debt owe by latin american and third world country do you favor give these country a break in their loan and if so how do you explain that to the american farmer who be lose their land and livelihood

 dukakis well i think we have to go to work on the problem of third world debt and we have get to assist those third world country in deal with this massive debt which they currently which they have incur and which be burden they and which if we do not do something about it and assist they along with other nation around the world we will destroy their economy destroy their future and at the same time will destroy market that be important to our farmer

 but i also believe we need an agricultural policy which do not cost we 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollar a year that it be be cost we over the course of the past three or four year under this administration i think it be go to require good solid credit policy and thank to the congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which be help and improve the situation with at least some of our farmer

 i think it be go to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price support to make sure that our farmer get a decent price and i think it also be go to require an administration that understand that there be tremendous opportunity out there for the development of new use for agricultural product new use which can help we to clean up our environment at the same time bio degradable plastic plastic gasohol which the vice president have be involve in road de icer make from corn product i mean there be enormous opportunity out there to expand market and to build a strong future for our farmer

 but i do not think there be anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about build a strong farm economy in this country and assist our family farm and provide a good strong future for rural community and for rural america and at the same time work on third world debt

 as a matter of fact mexico itself be one of our big agricultural customer so in the sense that we can work to help mexico rebuild and expand and deal with these very serious economic problem we help our farmer at the same time

 lehrer mr. vice president

 bush i oppose supply management and production control i support the farm bill the 1985 farm bill and spending be move in the right direction i want to expand our market abroad and that be why i have call for that first economic summit to be on agriculture

 i will not go back to the way the democrats do it and use food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmer in this country i want to see rural redevelopment and i have be out front in favor of alternate source of energy and one of they be gasohol and come from use your corn and i think we can do well in term of biodegradable for a lot of product so i be optimistic about the agricultural economy

 in term of the third world i support the baker plan i want to see market economy spring up all around the world and to the degree they do we be succeed and i do not want to see the bank let off the hook i would oppose that but i think be on the right track in agriculture and i be very very encouraged but let us not go back to that what they call supply management and production control that will simply price we out of the international market let us try to expand our market abroad

 lehrer all right that really be the end now let us go to closing statement they will be two minute each in duration by agreement vice president bush go first governor dukakis second mr. vice president

 bush i talk in new orleans about a gentle and kind nation and i have make specific proposal on education and the environment and on ethic and energy and how we do well in battle crime in our country but there be two main focal point of this election opportunity and peace

 i want to keep this expansion go yes we want change but we be the change i be the change i do not want to go back to malaise and misery index and so opportunity keep america at work the good poverty program be a job with dignity in the private sector and in term of peace we be on the right track we have achieve an arm control agreement that our critic think be never possible and i want to build on it i want to see we finalize that start agreement and i want it to be the one to finally lead the world to banish chemical and biological weapon

 i want to see asymmetrical reduction in conventional force and then it get down to a question of value we have have a chance to spell out our difference on the pledge of allegiance here tonight and on tough sentencing of drug king pin and this kind of thing and i do favor the death penalty and we have get a wide array of difference on those but in the final analysis in the final analysis the person go into that voting booth they be go to say who have the value i believe in who have the experience that we trust who have the integrity and stability to get the job do my fellow americans i be that man and i ask for your support thank you very much

 dukakis this have be an extraordinary 18 month for kitty and i and for our family we have have an opportunity to campaign all over this country and to meet with so many of you in community and state and region to get to know you i be more optimistic today than i be when i begin about this nation provide we have the kind of leadership in washington that can work with you that can build partnership that can build job in every part of this country not certain part of this country

 you know my friend my parent come to this country as immigrant like million and million of americans before they and since seek opportunity seek the american dream they make sure their son understand that this be the great country in the world that those of we especially who be the son and daughter of immigrant have a special responsibility to give something to the country that have open up its arm to our parent and give so much to they

 i believe in the american dream i be a product of it and i want to help that dream come true for every single citizen in this land with a good job and good wage with good school in every part of this country and every community in this country with decent and affordable housing that our people can buy and own and live in so that we end the shame of hopelessness in america with decent and affordable healthcare for all work family

 yes it be a tough problem as mr. bush say but it¹s not an insolvable problem it be one that we will solve and must solve with a clean and wholesome environment and with a strong america that be strong militarily and economically as we must be an america that provide strong international leadership because we be true to our value

 we have an opportunity work together to build that future to build a well america to build a good america because the good america do not hide we compete the good america we invest the good america do not leave some of its citizen behind we live we bring everybody along and the good america be not behind we the good america be yet to come

 thank you very much

mr. president mr. general secretary distinguished delegate half a world away from this place of peace the firing the killing the bloodshed in two merciless conflict have for the first time in recent memory diminish after add terrible new name to the roll call of human horror name such as halabja maidan shahr and spin buldak there be today hope of peace in the persian gulf and afghanistan so too in the highland and coastal city of southern africa place of civil war place of occupation by foreign troop talk of peace be hear peace for the tortured nation of angola

 sixty five hundred mile east in the southeast asian country of cambodia there be hope now of a settlement the removal of vietnam 's occupy force and finally in this hemisphere where only 12 year ago one third of the people of latin america live under democratic rule some 90 percent do so today and especially in central america nation such as el salvador once threaten by the anarchy of the death squad and the specter of totalitarian rule now know the hope of self government and the prospect of economic growth

 and another change mr. secretary general a change that if it endure may go down as one of the signal accomplishment of our history a change that be a cause for shake of the head in wonder be also upon we a change go to the source of postwar tension and to the once seemingly impossible dream of end the twin threat of our time totalitarianism and thermonuclear world war

 for the first time the difference between east and west fundamental difference over important moral question deal with the worth of the individual and whether government shall control people or people control government for the first time these difference have show sign of ease ease to the point where there be not just troop withdrawal from place like afghanistan but also talk in the east of reform and great freedom of press of assembly and of religion

 yes fundamental difference remain but should talk of reform become more than that should it become reality there be the prospect of not only a new era in soviet american relation but a new age of world peace for such reform can bring peace history teach and my country have always believe that where the right of the individual and the people be enshrine war be a distant prospect for it be not people who make war only government do that

 i stand at this podium then in a moment of hope hope not just for the people of the united states or the soviet union but for all the people of the world and hope too for the dream of peace among nation the dream that begin the united nations

 precisely because of these change today the united nations have the opportunity to live and breathe and work as never before already you mr. secretary general through your persistence patience and unyielde will have show in work toward peace in afghanistan and the persian gulf how valuable the united nations can be and we salute you for these accomplishment

 in geneva at this very hour there be numerous negotiation underway multilateral negotiation at the conference on disarmament as well as bilateral negotiation on a range of issue between the soviets and ourselves and these negotiation some of they under u.n. auspex involve a broad arm control agenda strategic offensive weapon and space nuclear testing and chemical warfare whose urgency we have witness anew in recent day and mr. secretary general the negotiator be busy and over the last few year they have be engage in more than an academic exercise there be movement the logjam be break only recently when the united states and the soviet union sign the inf agreement an entire class of u.s. and soviet nuclear missile be eliminate for the first time in history progress continue on negotiation to reduce in massive number strategic weapon with effective verification and talk will begin soon on conventional reduction in europe

 much of the reason for all of this go back i believe to geneva itself to the small chateau along the lake where i and the general secretary of the soviet union have the first of several fireside chat exchange characterize by frankness but friendliness too i say at the first meeting in geneva that this be a unique encounter between two people who have the power to start world war iii or to begin a new age of peace among nation and i also say peace conference arm negotiation proposal for treaty could make sense only if they be part of a wide context a context that seek to explore and resolve the deep underlie difference between we i say to mr. gorbachev then as i have say to you before nation do not mistrust each other because they be arm they be armed because they mistrust each other

 and in that place by that peaceful lake in neutral switzerland mr. gorbachev and i do begin a new relationship base not just on engagement over the single issue of arm control but on a broad agenda about our deep difference an agenda of human right regional conflict and bilateral exchange between our people even on the arm control issue itself we agree to go beyond the past to seek not just treaty that permit build weapon to high level but revolutionary agreement that actually reduce and even eliminate a whole class of nuclear weapon

 what be begin that morning in geneva have show result in the inf treaty in my recent visit to moscow in my opportunity to meet there with soviet citizen and dissident and speak of human right and to speak too in the lenin hills of moscow to the young people of the soviet union about the wonder and splendor of human freedom the result of that morning in geneva be see in peace conference now underway around the world on regional conflict and in the work of the u.n. here in new york as well as in geneva

 but mr. secretary general history teach caution indeed that very building in geneva where important negotiation have take place the geneva accord on afghanistan the iran iraq negotiation for example we see it today as stonelike testimony to a fail dream of peace in another time the palais des nations be the headquarters of the league of nations an institution that be to symbolize an end to all war and yet today that institution and its noble purpose end with the second world war end because the chance for peace be not seize in the 1930 's by the nation of the world end because humanity do not find the courage to isolate the aggressor to reject scheme of government that serve the state not the people

 we be here today mr. secretary general determine that no such fate shall befall the united nations we be determined that the u.n. should succeed and serve the cause of peace for humankind so mr. secretary general we realize that even in this time of hope the chance of failure be real but this knowledge do not discourage we it spur we on for the stake be high do we falter and fail now and bring down upon ourselves the just anger of future generation or do we continue the work of the founder of this institution and see to it that at last freedom be enshrined and humanity know war no long and that this place this floor shall be truly the world 's last battlefield we be determined it shall be so so we turn now to the agenda of peace

 let we begin by address a concern that be much on my mind when i meet with mr. gorbachev in the kremlin as well as on the mind of soviet citizen that i meet in moscow it be also an issue that i know be of immediate importance to the delegate of this assembly who this fall commemorate the 40th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights that declaration say plainly what those who seek peace can forget only at the great peril that peace rest on one foundation observe the inalienable right of all member of the human family in a century where human right have be deny by totalitarian government on a scale never before see in history with so many million deliberately starve or eliminate as a matter of state policy a history it have be say of blood stupidity and barbed wire few can wonder why peace have prove so elusive

 now let we understand if we would have peace we must acknowledge the elementary right of our fellow human being in our own land and in other land if we would have peace the trampling of the human spirit must cease human right be not for some some of the time human right as the universal declaration of this assembly adopt in 1948 proclaim be for all people and all nation and for all time

 this regard for human right as the foundation of peace be at the heart of the u.n. those who starve in ethiopia those who die among the kurds those who face racial injustice in south africa those who still can not write or speak freely in the soviet union those who can not worship in the ukraine those who struggle for life and freedom on boat in the south china sea those who can not publish or assemble in managua all of this be more than just an agenda item on your calendar it must be a first concern an issue above other for when human right concern be not paramount at the united nations when the universal declaration of human rights be not honor in these hall and meet room then the very credibility of this organization be at stake the very purpose of its existence in question

 that be why when human right progress be make the united nations grow strong and the united states be glad of it follow a 2 year effort lead by the united states for example the u.n. human rights commission take a major step toward end the double standard and cynicism that have characterize too much of its past for year cuba a blatant violator of its citizen human right have escape u.n. censure or even scrutiny this year cuba have respond to pressure generate by the human rights commission by accept an investigation into its human right abuse fidel castro have already begin to free some political prisoner improve prison condition and tolerate the existence of a small independent national human right group

 more must be do the united nations must be relentless and unyielde in seek change in cuba and elsewhere and we must also see to it that the universal declaration itself should not be debase with episode like the zionism be racism resolution respect for human right be the first and fundamental mission of this body the most elementary obligation of its member indeed wherever one turn in the world today there be new awareness a grow passion for human right the people of the world grow united new group new coalition form coalition that monitor government that work against discrimination that fight religious or political repression unlawful imprisonment torture or execution as those i speak to at spaso house say to i last june such movement make a difference

 turn now to regional conflict we feel again the uplift of hope in the gulf war between iran and iraq one of the bloodiest conflict since world war ii we have a cease fire the resolution and the firmness of the allied nation in keep the persian gulf open to international shipping not only uphold the rule of law it help prevent further spread of the conflict and lay the basis for peace so too the security council 's decisive resolution in july a year ago have become the blueprint for a peaceful gulf let this war a war in which there have be no victor or vanquish only victim let this war end now let both iran and iraq cooperate with the secretary general and the security council in implement resolution 598 let peace come

 move on to a second region when i first address the u.n. general assembly in 1983 world attention be focus on the brutal invasion and illegal occupation of afghanistan after nearly 9 long year of war the courage and determination of the afghan people and the afghan freedom fighter have hold sway and today an end to the occupation be in sight on april 14 the u.s.s.r. sign the geneva accord which be negotiate under u.n. auspex by pakistan and the kabul regime we encourage the soviet union to complete its troop withdrawal at the early possible date so that the afghan people can freely determine their future without further outside interference

 in southern africa too year of patient diplomacy and support for those in angola who seek self determination be have their effect we look forward to an accord between the government of angola cuba and south africa that will bring about a complete withdrawal of all foreign troop primarily cuban from angola we look forward as well to full implementation of u.n. security council resolution 435 and our longstanding goal of independence for namibia we continue to support a grow consensus among african leader who also believe there can be no end to conflict in the region until there be national reconciliation within angola

 mr. secretary general there be new hope for cambodia a nation whose freedom and independence we seek just as avidly as we seek the freedom and independence of afghanistan we urge the rapid removal of all vietnamese troop and a settlement that will prevent the return of the khmer rouge to power permit instead the establishment of a genuinely representative government a government that will at last respect fully the right of the people of cambodia and end the hideous suffering they have so bravely and needlessly bear

 in other critical area we applaud the secretary general 's effort to structure a referendum on the western sahara and in the mediterranean direct talk between greek and turkish cypriot community hold much promise for accord in that divide island nation and finally we look to a peaceful solution to the arab israeli conflict so too the unnatural division of europe remain a critical obstacle to soviet american relation

 in most of these area then we see progress and again we be glad of it only a few year ago all of these and other conflict be burn dangerously out of control indeed the invasion of afghanistan and the apparent will among democratic and peace love nation to deter such event seem to cause a climate where aggression by nation large and small be epidemic a climate the world have not see since the 1930 's only this time large war be avoid avoid because the free and peaceful nation of the world recover their strength of purpose and will and now the united nations be provide valuable assistance in help this epidemic to recede

 and because we be resolve to keep it so i would be remiss in my duty if i do not now take note here of the one exception to progress in regional conflict i refer here to the continue deterioration of human right in nicaragua and the refusal of the tiny elite now rule that nation to honor promise of democracy make to their own people and to the international community

 this elite in call itself revolutionary seek no real revolution the use of the term be subterfuge deception for hide the old most corrupt vice of all man 's age old will to power his lust to control the life and steal the freedom of other and that be why as president i will continue to urge the congress and the american public to stand behind those who resist this attempt to impose a totalitarian regime on the people of nicaragua that the united states will continue to stand with those who be threaten by this regime 's aggression against its neighbor in central america

 today i also call on the soviet union to show in central america the same spirit of constructive realism it have show in other regional conflict to assist in bring conflict in central america to a close by halt the flow of billion of dollar worth of arm and ammunition to the sandinista regime a regime whose goal of regional domination while ultimately doom can continue to cause great suffering to the people of that area and risk to soviet american relation unless action be take now

 move now to the arm reduction agenda i have mention already the importance of the inf treaty and the momentum develop in the start negotiation the draft start treaty be a lengthy document fill with bracketed language designate section of disagreement between the two side but through this summer in geneva those bracket have diminish there be every reason to believe this process can continue i can tell this assembly that it be highly doubtful such a treaty can be accomplish in a few month but i can tell you a year from now be a possibility more than a possibility but we have no deadline no agreement be well than a bad agreement the united states remain hopeful and we acknowledge the spirit of cooperation show by the soviet union in these negotiation we also look for that spirit to be apply to our concern about compliance with exist agreement

 so too our discussion on nuclear testing and defense and space have be useful but let i here stress to this general assembly that much of the momentum in nuclear arm control negotiation be due to technological progress itself especially in the potential for space base defensive system i believe that the united states determination to research and develop and when ready deploy such defensive system system target to destroy missile not people account for a large share of the progress make in recent year in geneva

 with such system for the first time in case of accidental launch or the act of a madman somewhere major power will not be face with the single option of massive retaliation but will instead have the chance of a saner choice to shield against an attack instead of avenge it so too as defensive system grow in effectiveness they reduce the threat and the value of great and great offensive arsenal only recently briefing i have receive in the oval office indicate that progress toward such system may be even more rapid and less costly than we have at first thought today the united states reaffirm its commitment to its strategic defense initiative and our offer to share the benefit of strategic defense with other

 and yet even as diplomatic and technological progress hold out the hope of at last diminish the awful cloud of nuclear terror we have live under in the postwar era even at this moment another ominous terror be loose once again in the world a terror we think the world have put behind a terror that loom at we now from the long bury past from ghostly scar trench and the haunting wan face of million dead in one of the most inhumane conflict of all time poison gas chemical warfare mr. secretary general distinguished delegate the terror of it the horror of it we condemn it the use of chemical weapon in the iran iraq war beyond its tragic human toll jeopardize the moral and legal stricture that have hold those weapon in check since world war i.

 let this tragedy spark reaffirmation of the geneva protocol outlaw the use of chemical weapon i call upon the signatory to that protocol as well as other concerned state to convene a conference to consider action that we can take together to reverse the serious erosion of this treaty and we urge all nation to cooperate in negotiate a verifiable truly global ban on chemical weapon at the conference on disarmament in geneva it be incumbent upon all civilized nation to ban once and for all and on a verifiable and global basis the use of chemical and gas warfare

 finally mr. secretary general we must redouble our effort to stop further proliferation of nuclear weapon in the world likewise proliferation in other high technology weapon such as ballistic missile be reach global proportion exacerbate regional rivalry in way that can have global implication the number of potential supplier be grow at an alarming rate and more must be do to halt the spread of these weapon this be a matter of discussion last week between secretary shultz and foreign minister shevardnadze talk between american and soviet expert begin on this today and we hope to see a multilateral effort to avoid have area of tension like the middle east become even more deadly battleground than they already be

 but in most of these area we see not only progress but also the potential for an increasingly vital role for multilateral effort and institution like this united nations that be why now more than ever the united nations must continue to increase its effectiveness through budget and program reform the u.n. already be enact sweeping measure affect personnel reduction budget by consensus and the establishment of program priority these action be extremely important the progress on reform have allow i to release fund withhold under congressional restriction i expect the reform program will continue and that further fund will be release in our new fiscal year

 and let i say here we congratulate the united nations on the work it have do in three area of special concern first our struggle against the scourge of terrorism and state sponsor terrorism must continue and we must also end the scourge of hostage taking second the work of the world health organization in coordinate and advance research on aids be vital all international effort in this area must be redouble the aids crisis be a grave one we must move as one to meet it

 and so too be the drug crisis we be move now toward a new anti drug traffic convention this important treaty will be complete in december i be confident other strong u.n. drug control program will also follow the american people be profoundly concerned and deeply angered we will not tolerate the drug trafficker we mean to make war on they and we believe this be one war the united nations can endorse and participate in

 yes the united nations be a well place than it be 8 year ago and so too be the world but the real issue of reform in the united nations be not limit just to fiscal and administrative improvement but also to a high sort of reform an intellectual and philosophical reform a reform of old view about the relationship between the individual and the state

 few development for example have be more encouraging to the united states than the special session this body hold on africa 2 1/2 year ago a session in which the united nations join as one in a call for free market incentive and a lessening of state control to spur economic development at one of the first international assembly of my presidency in cancun mexico i say history demonstrate that time and again in place after place economic growth and human progress make their great stride in country that encourage economic freedom that individual farmer laborer owner trader and manager be the heart and soul of development trust they because where they be allow to create and build where they be give a personal stake in decide economic policy and benefit from their success then society become more dynamic prosperous progressive and free we believe in freedom we know it work

 and this mr. secretary general and distinguished delegate be the immutable lesson of the postwar era that freedom work even more that freedom and peace work together every year that pass everywhere in the world this lesson be take hold from the people 's republic of china to cameroon from bolivia to botswana and yes in the citadel of marxism leninism itself no my country do not invent this synergy of peace and freedom but believe i we impose no restriction on the free export of our more than two century of experience with it free people bless by economic opportunity and protect by law that respect the dignity of the individual be not drive toward war or the domination of other here then be the way to world peace

 and yet we americans champion freedom not only because it be practical and beneficial but because it be also just morally right and here mr. secretary general i hope you will permit i to note that i have address this assemblage more than any of my predecessor and that this will be the last occasion i do so so i hope too i may be permit now some closing reflection

 the world be currently witness another celebration of international cooperation at the olympics we see nation join together in the competition of sport and we see young people who know precious little of the resentment of their elder come together as one one of our young athlete from a home of modest mean say that she draw the strength for her achievement from another source of wealth we be rich as a family she say about the love she be give and the value she be teach mr. secretary general i dare to hope that in the sentiment of that young athlete we see a sign of the rediscovery of old and tested value value such as family the first and most important unit of society where all value and learn begin an institution to be cherish and protect value too such as work community freedom and faith for it be here we find the deep rationale for the cause of human right and world peace

 and our own experience on this continent the american experience though brief have have one unmistakable encounter an insistence on the preservation of one sacred truth it be a truth that our first president our founding father pass on in the first farewell address make to the american people it be a truth that i hope now you will permit i to mention in these remark of farewell a truth embody in our declaration of independence that the case for inalienable right that the idea of human dignity that the notion of conscience above compulsion can be make only in the context of high law only in the context of what one of the founder of this organization secretary general dag hammarskjold have call devotion to something which be great and high than we be ourselves this be the endless cycle the final truth to which humankind seem always to return that religion and morality that faith in something high be prerequisite for freedom and that justice and peace within ourselves be the first step toward justice and peace in the world and for the age

 yes this be a place of great debate and grave discussion and yet i can not help but note here that one of our founding fathers the most worldly of man an internationalist benjamin franklin interrupt the proceeding of our own constitutional convention to make much the same point and i can not help but think this morning of other beginning of where and when i first read those word and they shall beat their sword into plowshare and your young man shall see vision and your old man shall dream dream this morning my thought go to she who give i many thing in life but her most important gift be the knowledge of happiness and solace to be gain in prayer it be the great help i have have in my presidency and i recall here lincoln 's word when he say only the most foolish of man would think he could confront the duty of the office i now hold without turn to someone strong a power above all other

 i think then of she and other like she in that small town in illinois gentle people who possess something that those who hold position of power sometimes forget to prize no one of they could ever have imagine the boy from the bank of the rock river would come to this moment and have this opportunity but have they be tell it would happen i think they would have be a bit disappointed if i would not speak here for what they know so well that when we grow weary of the world and its trouble when our faith in humanity falter it be then that we must seek comfort and refreshment of spirit in a deep source of wisdom one great than ourselves

 and so if future generation do say of we that in our time peace come close that we do bring about new season of truth and justice it will be cause for pride but it shall be a cause of great pride still if it be also say that we be wise enough to know the deliberation of great leader and great body be but overture that the truly majestic music the music of freedom of justice and peace be the music make in forget self and seek in silence the will of he who make we

 thank you for your hospitality over the year i bid you now farewell and god bless you





thank you very much thank you please be seat

 those who live today remember those who do not those who know freedom remember today those who give up life for freedom today in honor of the dead we conduct ceremony we lie wreath we speak word of tribute and in our memory in our heart we hold they close to we still yet we also know even as their family know when they last look upon they that they can never be fully ours again that they belong now to god and to that for which they so selflessly make a final and eternal act of devotion

 we could not forget they even if they be not our own we could not forget they for all time they be what we can only aspire to be give unselfish the epitome of human love to lay down one 's life so that other might live we think on their life we think on their final moment in our mind 's eye we see young americans in a european forest or on an asian island or at sea or in aerial combat and as life expire we know that those who could have last thought of we and of their love for we as they think of we then so too we think of they now with love with devotion and with faith the certainty that what they die for be worthy of their sacrifice faith too in god and in the nation that have pledge itself to his work and to the dream of human freedom and a nation too that today and always pledge itself to their eternal memory

 thank you god bless you

well thank you very much for that warm welcome governor baliles congressman slaughter and my very special thank too to senator warner and president o'neil for suggest this invitation and you know as president i have certain privilege so i check with president o'neil and i be delighted to announce that start monday night you all have 4 week off

 but here at uva we be surround with memory of thomas jefferson one of my staff mention that thomas jefferson 's favorite recreation be horseback riding and i say he be a wise man laughter and another member of the staff say that thomas jefferson think the white house be a noble edifice and i say he be a man of refined taste laughter and a third staff member note that after retire as president thomas jefferson in his seventy do not sit back and rest but found the university of virginia and i say there be always an overachiever which make it hard for the rest of we

 but no speaker can come to these ground or see the lawn without appreciate the symmetry not just of the architecture but of the mind that create it the man to whom that mind belong be know to you as mr. jefferson and i think the familiarity of that term be justify his influence here be everywhere and yet while those of you at uva be fortunate to have before you physical reminder of the power of your founder 's intellect and imagination it should be remember that all you do here indeed all of high education in america bear sign too of his transform genius the pursuit of science the study of the great work the value of free inquiry in short the very idea of the live the life of the mind yes these formative and abide principle of high education in america have their first and firmest advocate and their great embodiment in a tall fair head friendly man who watch this university take form from the mountainside where he live the university whose founding he call a crowning achievement to a long and well spend life

 well you be not alone in feel his presence president know about this too you have hear many time that during the first year of his presidency john f. kennedy say to a group of nobel laureate in the state dining room of the white house that there have not be such a collection of talent in that place since jefferson dine there alone laughter and directly down the lawn and across the ellipse from the white house be those order classic line of the jefferson memorial and the eye of the 19 foot statue that gaze directly into the white house a reminder to any of we who might occupy that mansion of the quality of mind and generosity of heart that once abide there and have be so rarely see there again

 but it be not just student and president it be every american indeed every human life ever touch by the daring idea of self government that mr. jefferson have influence yes mr. jefferson be oblige to admit all previous attempt at popular government have prove themselves failure but he believe that here on this continent as one of his commentator put it ` ` here be virgin soil an abundance of land no degrading poverty a brave and intelligent people which have just vindicate its title to independence after a long struggle with the mighty of european power

 well here be another chance an opportunity for enlightened government government base on the principle of reason and tolerance government that leave to the people the fruit of their labor and the pursuit of their own definition of happiness in the form of commerce or education or religion and so it be no wonder he ask that his epitaph read simply ` ` here be bear bury thomas jefferson author of the declaration of american independence of the statute of virginia for religious freedom and father of the university of virginia

 well as that epitaph show for all his learning and bookishness mr. jefferson be a practical man a man who make thing thing like a university a state government a national government in found and sustain these institution he want they to be base on the same symmetry the same balance of mind and faith in human creativity evidence in the lawn he have know personal tragedy he know how disorderly a place the world could be indeed as a leader of a rebellion he be himself an architect if you will of disorder but he also believe that man have receive from god a precious gift of enlightenment the gift of reason a gift that could extract from the chaos of life meaning truth order

 just as we see in his architecture the balancing of circular with linear of rotunda with pillar we see in his work of government the same disposition toward balance toward symmetry and harmony he know successful self government mean bring together disparate interest and concern balancing for example on the one hand the legitimate duty of government the maintenance of domestic order and protection from foreign menace with government 's tendency to preempt its citizen right take the fruit of their labor and reduce they ultimately to servitude so he know that govern mean balance harmony and he know from personal experience the danger pose to such harmony by the voice of unreason special privilege partisanship or intolerance

 and i do mean personal experience you see despite all of george washington 's warning about the divisiveness of the partisan spirit federalists and republicans be constantly at each other in those day the federalists of the northeast have hold power for a long time and be not anxious to relinquish it year later a new york congressman honor the good old day when as he put it ` ` a federalist could knock a republican down in the street of new york and not be question about it the federalists refer to mr. jefferson as and here i quote ` ` a mean spirit low live fellow raise wholly on hotcake make of coarse ground southern corn bacon and hominy with an occasional fricasseed bullfrog laughter well by the way be the 1800 equivalent of what i believe be know here at uva as a gus burger laughter and an editorial in the federalist connecticut courant also announce that as soon as mr. jefferson be elect ` ` murder robbery rape and adultery and incest will be openly teach and practice laughter

 well that be politic in 1800 so you see not all that much have change laughter actually i have take a moment for these brief reflection on thomas jefferson and his time precisely because there be such clear parallel to our own we too have see a new populism in america not at all unlike that of jefferson 's time we have see the growth of a jefferson like populism that reject the burden place on the people by excessive regulation and taxation that reject the notion that judgeship should be use to far privately hold belief not yet approve by the people and finally reject too the notion that foreign policy must reflect only the rarefied concern of washington rather than the common sense of a people who can frequently see far more plainly danger to their freedom and to our national well being

 it be this latter point that bring i to the university of virginia today there have be much change in the last 8 year in our foreign relation and this september when i speak to the united nations i summarize much of the progress we have see in such matter as the human right agenda arm reduction and resolve those regional conflict that might lead to wide war i will not recite all of this here again today but i do want you to know i find in the delegate afterward a warmth that i have not see before let i assure you not due to any eloquence on my part but just a simple perception on their part that there be a chance for an opening a new course in human event i think i detect a sense of excitement even perhaps like that feel by those who live in jefferson 's time a sense of new possibility for the idea of popular government only this time it be not just a single nation at issue it be the whole world where popular government might flourish and prosper

 only a few year ago this would have seem the most outlandish and dreamiest of prospect but consider for just a moment the strive for democracy that we have see in place like the philippines burma korea chile poland south africa even place like china and the soviet union one of the great unnoticed and yet most startling development of this decade be this more of the world 's populace be today live in relative freedom than ever before in history more and more nation be turn to freely elect democratic government

 the statistic themselves be compelling accord to one organization freedom house in the past 15 year the number of country call not free decline from 71 to 50 and the country classify as free or partly free increase from 92 to 117 when you consider that accord to the freedom house count 70 percent of those not live in freedom be in china and the soviet union and even in those nation as i say we see glimpse of hope the picture be even bright the most dramatic movement of all have take place more than 90 percent of the people be now live in country that be democratic or head in that direction

 this democratic revolution have be accompany by a change in economic thinking comparable to the newtonian revolution in physics and that be no accident free market economy have work miracle in several nation of east asia a u.n. general assembly special session on africa have call for more market orient structural reform in that region in europe the tide be against state ownership of property and even in china and the soviet union the theoretical underpinning of socialist economic be be reexamine

 in this atmosphere we have continue to emphasize prudent but deepen development of economic tie which be critical to our economic health in the conduct of our foreign policy in our own hemisphere we be about to implement an historic free trade agreement between the united states and canada that could well serve as a model for the world

 these democratic and free market revolution be really the same revolution they be base on the vital nexus between economic and political freedom and on the jeffersonian idea that freedom be indivisible that government 's attempt to encroach on that freedom whether it be through political restriction on the right of assembly speech or publication or economic repression through high taxation and excessive bureaucracy have be the principal institutional barrier to human progress

 but if this remarkable revolution have not be obvious to many certainly one other eye open change have be self evident consider for just a moment the sight we have see this year an american president with his soviet counterpart stroll through red square and talk to passer by about war and peace an american president there in the lenin hills of moscow speak to the student of moscow state university young people like yourself about the wonder and splendor of human freedom an american president only last week with a future american president and the president of the soviet union stand in new york harbor look up at lady liberty hear again the prayer on the lip of all those million who once pass that way in hope of a well life and future a prayer of peace and freedom for all humanity

 and yes even this week in the devastation of armenia americans and russians make common cause as we once make common cause against another terrible enemy 44 year ago but it be not the visual and the sound bite that matter behind all of this be a record of diplomatic movement and accomplishment

 one of those visual you have see in the last year be the signing of accord between mr. gorbachev and i and the destruction of american and soviet missile it be more than just good television more than just action news the inf treaty be the first accord in history to eliminate an entire class of u.s. and soviet nuclear missile and the start treaty which deal with far large arsenal of long range or what the expert call strategic weapon call for 50 percent reduction in such weapon

 in geneva where the portion of the draft treaty dispute by one side or the other be put in bracket we be slowly see those bracket disappear so the treaty be come close and so too there be progress on nuclear testing agreement and chemical weapon and we be about to begin new negotiation on the conventional balance in europe mr. gorbachev 's recent announcement at the u.n. about troop reduction be most welcome and appreciate but it be important to remember this be a part of and the result of a large disarmament process set in motion several year ago

 another area where the achievement be visible be that of regional conflict in afghanistan we have see a settlement lead towards soviet withdrawal in cambodia the first step have be take toward withdrawal of vietnamese troop in brazzaville just this tuesday   an american mediate accord be sign that will send some 50,000 cuban soldier home from angola the second reversal of cuban military imperialism after our rescue of grenada in 1983

 in the matter of human right we have also see extraordinary progress the release of some political prisoner in the soviet union initial step toward a reduction of state economic control and more politically representative form of government some great scope to publish and speak critically an increase in emigration and visible step toward great religious freedom

 and finally in our bilateral exchange we be see more soviet and american citizen visit each other 's land and a great interchange of scientific cultural and intellectual tradition the summit themselves be indication of the progress we have make here i look to the day when the meeting between the leader of the soviet union and the united states will be regular and frequent and maybe not quite so newsworthy

 where we be strong steadfast we succeed in the persian gulf the united states make clear its commitment to defend freedom of navigation and free world interest and this help hasten an end to the gulf war and the country stand firm for year insist that the plo have to accept israel 's right to exist sign on to resolutions 242 and 338 and renounce terrorism and now that resolve have pay off

 now the democratic revolution that i talk about early and all the change and movement and yes breakthrough that i have just cite on the diplomatic front can be directly attribute to the restoration of confidence on the part of democratic nation there can be little doubt that in the decade of the eighty the cause of freedom and human right have prosper and the specter of nuclear war have be push back because the democracy have recover their strength their compass

 here at home a national consensus on the importance of strong american leadership be emerge as i say before the congress at the start of this year no legacy would make i more proud than leave in place such a consensus for the cause of world freedom a consensus that prevent a paralysis of american power from ever occur again

 now i think much of the reason for all of this have to do with the new coherence and clarity that we have bring to our foreign policy a new coherence base on a strong reaffirmation of value by the allied nation the same idea that so energize mr. jefferson and the other founder of this nation the idea of popular government have drive the revival of the west and a renewal of its value and its belief in itself

 but now the question how do we keep the world move toward the idea of popular government well today i offer three thought reflection and warning at the same time on how the soviet american relationship can continue to improve and how the cause of peace and freedom can be serve

 first the soviet american relationship once mark by sterility and confrontation this relationship be now characterize by dialog realistic candid dialog serious diplomatic progress and the sight and sound of summitry all of this be heady inspire and yet my first reflection for you today be all of it be still in doubt and the only way to make it last and grow and become permanent be to remember we be not there yet

 serious problem fundamental difference remain our system be one of check and balance theirs for all its reform remain a one party authoritarian system that institutionalize the concentration of power our foreign relation embrace this expand world of democracy that i have describe theirs can be know by the company they keep cuba nicaragua ethiopia libya vietnam north korea yes we welcome mr. gorbachev 's recent announcement of a troop reduction but let we remember that the soviet preponderance in military power in europe remain an asymmetry that offend our jeffersonian sense and endanger our future

 so we must keep our head and that mean keep our skepticism we must realize that what have bring we here have not be easy not for ourselves nor for all of those who have sacrifice and contribute to the cause of freedom in the postwar era

 so this mean in our treaty negotiation as i have say trust but verify i be not a linguist but i learn to say that much russian and have use it in frequent meeting with mr. gorbachev ` ` dovorey no provorey it mean keep our military strong it mean remember no treaty be well than a bad treaty it mean remember the accord of moscow and washington summit follow many year of stand firm on our principle and our interest and those of our ally

 and finally we need to recall that in the year of detente we tend to forget the great weapon the democracy have in their struggle be public candor the truth we must never do that again it be not an act of belligerence to speak to the fundamental difference between totalitarianism and democracy it be a moral imperative it do not slow down the pace of negotiation it move they forward throughout history we see evidence that adversary negotiate seriously with democratic nation only when they know the democracy harbor no illusion about those adversary

 a second reflection i have on all this concern some recent speculation that what be happen in the soviet union be in its way inevitable that since the death of stalin the soviet state would have to evolve into a more moderate and status quo power in accordance with some vague theory of convergence i think this be wrong it be also dangerous because what we see in the soviet union today be a change of a different order than in the past

 for example whatever the khrushchev era may or may not have represent in soviet internal politic we know how aspiration for great freedom be crush in poland and germany and even more bloodily in hungary we also see the construction of the berlin wall we see cuba become an active client state a client state spread subversion throughout latin america and bring the entire world to the brink of war with the ` ` missile of october

 and let i assure you mr. khrushchev give no speech at the u.n. like that recently give by mr. gorbachev as one british u.n. official say about khrushchev appearance there ` ` we be never quite sure whether it be indeed mr. khrushchev 's shoe be use to pound the soviet desk or whether mr. gromyko 's shoe have be borrow or whether there be an extra shoe keep under the soviet podium especially for bang purpose laughter

 now all of this be hardly encouraging for the growth of freedom and the path to peace we know too what happen in the brezhnev era great and great expansionism afghanistan economic decay and overwhelming corruption a great and great burden on the people of the soviet union on all the people of the world

 now this be change how much and how fast it will change we do not know i would like to think that action by this country particularly our willingness to make ourselves clear our expression of firmness and will evidence by our plain talk strong defense vibrant alliance and readiness to use american power when american power be need help to prompt the reappraisal that soviet leader have undertake of their previous policy even more western resolve demonstrate that the hardline advocate by some within the soviet union would be fruitless just as our economic success have set a shine example as i suggest in 1982 if the west maintain its strength we would see economic need clash with the political order in the soviet union this have happen but it could not have happen if the west have not maintain indeed strengthen its will its commitment to world freedom

 so there be nothing inevitable about all of this human action make the difference mr. gorbachev have take some daring step as i have say before this be the first soviet leader not to make world revolution a priority well let we credit those step let we credit he and let we remember too that the democracy with their strength and resolve and candor have also make a difference

 and this be the heart of my point what happen in the next few year whether all this progress be continue or end this be in large part up to we it be why now more then ever we must not falter american power must be exercise morally of course but it must also be exercise and exercise effectively for the cause of peace and freedom in the eighty that power make all the difference the ninety will prove no different

 and this bring we to my third point the relationship between the executive and the congress it be precisely where congress and the president have work together as in afghanistan and cambodia or resolve difference as in angola the persian gulf and many aspect of u.s.-soviet relation precisely there our policy have succeed and we see progress but where congress and the president have engage each other as adversary as over central america u.s. policy have falter and our common purpose have not be achieve

 congress on again off again indecisiveness on resist sandinista tyranny and aggression have leave central america a region of continue danger sometimes congressional action in foreign affair have have the effect of institutionalize that kind of adversarial relationship we see it in the war powers resolution in the attempt restriction on the president 's power to implement treaty and on trade policy we see it in the attempt to manage complex issue of foreign policy by the blunt instrument of legislation such as unduly restrictive intelligence oversight limit on arm transfer and earmarking of 95 percent of our foreign assistance deny a president the ability to respond flexibly to rapidly change condition even in arm reduction a president 's ability to succeed depend on congressional support for military modernization sometimes attempt be make to weaken my hand

 the founding fathers understand the need for effectiveness coherence consistency and flexibility in the conduct of foreign affair as jefferson himself say ` ` the transaction of business with foreign nation be executive altogether it belong then to the head of that department except as to such portion of it as be specially submit to the senate exception be to be construe strictly

 well the president and the vice president be elect by all the people so too be the congress as a collegial body all who be elect to serve in these coordinate department of our national government have one unmistakable and undeniable mandate to preserve protect and defend the constitution to this this foremost they must always be attentive for a president it mean protect his office and its place in our constitutional framework in do that the president be accountable to the people in the most direct way accountable to history and to his own conscience

 the president and congress to be sure share many responsibility but their role be not the same congress alone for example have the power of the purse the president be chief executive chief diplomat and commander in chief how these great branch of government perform their legitimate role be critically important to the nation 's ability to succeed nowhere more so than in the field of foreign affair they need each other and must work together in common cause with all deference but within their separate sphere

 today we live in a world in which america no long enjoy preponderant power but must lead by example and persuasion a world of press new challenge to our economic prosperity a world of new opportunity for peace and of new danger in such a world more than ever america need strong and consistent leadership and the strength and resilience of the presidency be vital

 i think if we can keep these concern in mind during the come year public debate and support will be enhance and america 's foreign policy will continue to prosper all of we know the terrible importance of maintain the progress we have make in the decade of the eighty we be move away from war and confrontation toward peace and freedom and today toward a future beyond the imagining of the past these be the stake some may find such prospect daunt i think you should find they challenging and exciting and i think you can see that in all of this you and your country will have a special role to play

 the issue before the world be still the same as the one that jefferson face so squarely and so memorably can human being manage their own affair be self determination and popular representative government possible mr. jefferson 's work and life amount to a great mighty assent to that question so too will yours and america 's if we can keep in mind the great and last lesson of jefferson 's life and it have something to do with what i just speak to about the executive and congress

 i be fond of recollect that in the last year of their life john adams and thomas jefferson who have work so hard and well together for the nation 's independence both come to regret that they have let partisan difference come between they for year their estrangement last but then when both retire jefferson at 68 to monticello and adams at 76 to quincy they begin through their letter to speak again to each other letter that discuss almost every conceivable subject gardening horseback riding even sneeze as a cure for hiccup laughter but other subject as well the loss of love one the mystery of grief and sorrow the importance of religion and of course the last thought the final hope of two old man two great patriarch for the country that they have help to found and love so deeply

 ` ` it carry i back jefferson write about his correspondence with his cosigner of the declaration of independence ` ` to the time when beset with difficulty and danger we be fellow laborer in the same cause struggle for what be most valuable to man his right to self government labor always at the same oar with some wave ever ahead threaten to overwhelm we and yet pass harmless we row through the storm with heart and hand

 it be their last gift to we this lesson in tolerance for each other in charity this insight into america 's strength as a nation and when both die on the same day within hour of each other the date be july 4th 50 year exactly after that first gift to we the declaration of independence

 a great future be ours and the world 's if we but remember the power of those word mr. jefferson pen not just for americans but for all humanity ` ` that all man be create equal that they be endow by their creator with certain inalienable right that among these be life liberty and the pursuit of happiness

 thank you and god bless you

 democracy in the soviet union

 q. mr. president and i think i can speak for everybody we really do thank you for come to uva but my question be consider that lenin claim that the soviets should let capitalist country fund the building of communism i would like to know what be your position on grant most favor nation status to the soviet union and do you think if we do grant this status that it will help promote democracy in the soviet union

 the president well we want to help promote this democracy in the soviet union but i believe that we have get to proceed by watch whether deed match the word now in some instance they certainly have permit i for example to speak to the student at the university of moscow i find out afterward however that they could not get all the student body in only a few hundred so they decide that the few hundred would be those who be member of the young communist league laughter

 but i think that there be difference between we and with this man when we have the first summit at geneva and i will try not to make my answer this long again people more experienced in this who would be on our team tell i that if we could get just the agreement to a second summit that the summit would be worthwhile

 well i have an idea of my own in the first meeting and as we sit they on their side of the table and my team on ours i look across the table at the general secretary you know i do not know which to call he he be get three title now general secretary president and chairman laughter then he be the general secretary and i suggest that why do not we leave our team here to start talk the subject that be raise be disarmament and why do not he and i go out and get some air

 well he jump up before i even finish speak and out we go and it be plan there be a fire in the fireplace it be very cold that day down in a little house along the lake from below where we be so we walk down and for an hour and a half he and i have a meeting and a discussion and then we decide we would well get back up to the regular meeting laughter and we be just outside the building and he say something to i about that i have never see russia and i turn to he and say ` ` and you have never see the united states you have never be in the united states before i say ` ` we be have the summit here why do not we have the next summit in the united states and i hereby invite you and he say ` ` i accept and he say ` ` then why do not we have the follow one in 1987 in the soviet union i say ` ` i accept

 well when i tell our people that we be already schedule for two more summit laughter in our two country they almost fall down they could not believe it so immediately we see a great difference between this man and the previous leader of the soviet union you see i have not have much chance to meet with they they keep die on i laughter

 middle east peace efforts

 q. mr. president with regard to the recent development with yasser arafat and the plo do you feel that this mark a culmination of your policy and your effort to bring peace to the troubled region of the middle east

 the president well it be merely a step forward to that because peace which do not exist there most people forget that those country be still technically be in a state of war with each other it be only go to come when the principal come together to negotiate outside we have be try to help and internationally and so forth with the other nation and this have be a great step forward and again it be similar to our use strength and stick to our purpose in other area that bring it about

 we have say from the very first that there be these main point the 242 and 338 u.n. security council resolution the recognition of israel 's right to exist as a nation which have never be advance before and thing of this kind that have to be agree to before we could have a dialog with the plo which be the principal opponent and when that take place as it just do for the first time clearly and without fuzze it up with ambiguous dialog when they meet those term we say yes and already the process be go forward to arrange for that dialog but the peace must be bring about by the principal in the dispute and we be hope that this now be the main step that will lead we toward that

 terrorism

 q. mr. president and i would like to congratulate you on two completely successful term as president my question be do you believe that your policy on terrorism have be effective and will the bush administration continue these policy or embark on new one completely on their own

 the president well i think that the next administration if i be correct in your question there yes will continue the policy we adopt a policy of complete resistance to terrorism no recognition of a country that support it and there be country that do and i think an example the short example that i can give you be when we have the irrefutable proof that qadhafi of libya have be responsible for terrorism that take the life of a number of people at an airport in europe include some americans we respond

 and i be go to knock on wood just one more line on that since that response there have be no libyan terrorist move against any

 advice to youth

 q. mr. president to many people my age you be the only president we have know or at least care to remember laughter i know i speak for many of we when i say your word carry very special significance what advice do you offer we as we approach a new century in an ever more uncertain future

 the president oh oh laughter the age group 18 to 24 among voter be the one that be most definitely in support of the type of thing that we have be do in these 8 year but now i have to say to you it be the age group also in which the few number or proportion vote so i would suggest to you because it be your world that we be talk about and if you have not get around to register or bother to vote or you know someone that have not make sure that age group of your who be go to have to take over the rein of government pretty soon that you make your view know in the polling place i think this be most vital

 and then oh i could lobby for an awful lot of thing laughter like a balanced budget amendment and a line item veto laughter your governor have that i have it when i be governor of california the line item veto

 administration accomplishments

 q. mr. president welcome to the university of virginia thank you for come and i think you have be a great leader as everyone have say laughter thank you for your advice i would like to know what you feel be your most significant accomplishment in the area of number one foreign policy and number two domestic policy

 the president what do i feel be the most important accomplishment well i think in both of those that we have redress in foreign policy our strength when i take office on any give day half of the military aircraft of the united states could not fly for lack of spare part half of the ship in our navy could not leave port for much the same reason or lack of crew and i immediately meet with the joint chiefs of staff and want to talk to they about restore a patriotism where the young man and woman in uniform would not feel they have to get into civilian clothe when they leave the base but would be proud to be see wear the uniform

 today a high percentage of our military be high school graduate and it be a volunteer military than ever in our history and there be three intelligence bracket use in the military for the assignment of people as to what proper function and so forth the high percentage in the top intelligence bracket that we have ever know before in our military and of all the thing i be proud of i be proud of the young man and woman who be wear our uniform more than anything but this redressing of that but also i come into office thinking that for some time i be think that there be a hunger for a spiritual revival in america and i think that have take place i hear from more and more people talk about the pride they have in country

 on the economic front i get a degree in economic i do not deserve it but i get it laughter but i take away i remember something that happen several hundred year ago laughter and it be a man name ibn khaldun in egypt i do not know they have economist then but ibn khaldun say that at the beginning of the empire the tax rate be low and the revenue be great at the end of the empire the rate be great and the revenue be low

 so i come away with the belief that you do not gain revenue by raise taxis and in fact our whole national experience prove it when coolidge take to tax reduction the revenue of the government increase and the same thing happen to a certain extent with president kennedy 's tax reduction which be similar to ours

 so one of my first goal be to unleash the economy of this country and get government off the back and out of an adversarial relationship with the private sector so that the people of this country could do with their freedom what they be intend to do that be all we really have do in this administration we get out of your way

 and we have these people that still say that we have a target of 1993 for a balanced budget and we be meet that target on every step now but these people that still be talk that we be go to have to raise taxis they will undo the great economic reform we have create almost 19 million new job in these several year of economic reform

 this personal disposable income after taxis have rise high than it ever be before and government revenue from the income tax increase by $ 375 billion since we implement our tax reform and our tax cut the trouble be spend increase $ 450 billion i have not have a budget yet by law i have to submit a budget every year i do and present company except the congress just put it on the shelf and send i a continue resolution of their own doing laughter

 so i think the great economic recovery i have have the pleasure of face a number of our trading partner the head of state of our trading partner japan germany france the united kingdom and on and on in a meeting and have they i be the new kid in school they would all be there long than i have and they be sit there silently and then one of they a spokesman say tell we about the american miracle well the american miracle be simply the unleashing of resource and the last point be regulation george bush i put in charge of a task force to see how many government regulation he could eliminate he eliminate so many that our estimate today be that the paperwork impose upon you and on community government and on state governments have be reduce by 600 million man hour a year well i get too long on that answer laughter

 president 's future plans

 q. mr. president you be of course near the end of your second term after the inauguration of george bush what do the future hold for ronald reagan

 the president well you know in hollywood if you do not sing or dance you wind up as an after dinner speaker laughter and so that be my personal appearance role be a speaker out there on the mashed potato circuit laughter and there be always i think for everyone who ever leave this post there be thing you do not get do

 and i think i will be out on the mashed potato circuit again extoll the virtue of line item veto and a balanced budget amendment laughter and again defend the right of we to maintain our military defense and so forth and i be very tempt about the idea somebody be talk to i about do a book and there be some backstage story that i might enjoy get out laughter but i be go to be active i be not go to be up at the ranch any more than much that i have be able to on the visit that i occasionally make there but i be go to be active and i know that nancy be go to continue her activity in the antidrug campaign too

 be you the last one or be there a sixth do i miscount

 mr. o'neil that be the sixth

 the president that be the sixth all right i miscount laughter thank you very much

this be the 34th time i will speak to you from the oval office and the last we have be together eight year now and soon it will be time for i to go but before i do i want to share some thought some of which i have be save for a long time

 it be be the honor of my life to be your president so many of you have write the past few week to say thank but i could say as much to you nancy and i be grateful for the opportunity you give we to serve

 one of the thing about the presidency be that you be always somewhat apart you spend a lot of time go by too fast in a car someone else be drive and see the people through tinted glass the parent hold up a child and the wave you see too late and could not return and so many time i want to stop and reach out from behind the glass and connect well maybe i can do a little of that tonight

 people ask how i feel about leave and the fact be parting be such sweet sorrow the sweet part be california and the ranch and freedom the sorrow the goodbye of course and leave this beautiful place

 you know down the hall and up the stair from this office be the part of the white house where the president and his family live there be a few favorite window i have up there that i like to stand and look out of early in the morning the view be over the ground here to the washington monument and then the mall and the jefferson memorial but on morning when the humidity be low you can see past the jefferson to the river the potomac and the virginia shore someone say that be the view lincoln have when he see the smoke rise from the battle of bull run i see more prosaic thing the grass on the bank the morning traffic as people make their way to work now and then a sailboat on the river

 i have be think a bit at that window i have be reflect on what the past eight year have mean and mean and the image that come to mind like a refrain be a nautical one a small story about a big ship and a refugee and a sailor it be back in the early 80 at the height of the boat people and the sailor be hard at work on the carrier midway which be patrol the south china sea the sailor like most american servicemen be young smart and fiercely observant the crew spy on the horizon a leaky little boat and cram inside be refugee from indochina hope to get to america the midway send a small launch to bring they to the ship and safety as the refugee make their way through the choppy sea one spy the sailor on deck and stand up and call out to he he yell hello american sailor hello freedom man

 a small moment with a big meaning a moment the sailor who write it in a letter could not get out of his mind and when i see it neither could i. because that be what it be to be an american in the 1980s we stand again for freedom i know we always have but in the past few year the world again and in a way we ourselves rediscover it

 it be be quite a journey this decade and we hold together through some stormy sea and at the end together we be reach our destination

 the fact be from grenada to the washington and moscow summit from the recession of 81 to 82 to the expansion that begin in late 82 and continue to this day we have make a difference the way i see it there be two great triumph two thing that i be proud of one be the economic recovery in which the people of america create and filled—19 million new job the other be the recovery of our morale america be respect again in the world and look to for leadership

 something that happen to i a few year ago reflect some of this it be back in 1981 and i be attend my first big economic summit which be hold that year in canada the meeting place rotate among the member country the opening meeting be a formal dinner of the head of goverment of the seven industrialize nation now i sit there like the new kid in school and listen and it be all francois this and helmut that they drop title and speak to one another on a first name basis well at one point i sort of lean in and say my name 's ron well in that same year we begin the action we feel would ignite an economic comeback cut taxis and regulation start to cut spending and soon the recovery begin

 two year later another economic summit with pretty much the same cast at the big opening meeting we all get together and all of a sudden just for a moment i see that everyone be just sit there look at i and then one of they break the silence tell we about the american miracle he say

 well back in 1980 when i be run for president it be all so different some pundit say our program would result in catastrophe our view on foreign affair would cause war our plan for the economy would cause inflation to soar and bring about economic collapse i even remember one highly respected economist say back in 1982 that the engine of economic growth have shut down here and they be likely to stay that way for year to come well he and the other opinion leader be wrong the fact be what they call radical be really right what they call dangerous be just desperately need

 and in all of that time i win a nickname the great communicator but i never think it be my style or the word i use that make a difference it be the content i be not a great communicator but i communicate great thing and they do not spring full bloom from my brow they come from the heart of a great nation from our experience our wisdom and our belief in the principle that have guide we for two century they call it the reagan revolution well i will accept that but for i it always seem more like the great rediscovery a rediscovery of our value and our common sense

 common sense tell we that when you put a big tax on something the people will produce less of it so we cut the people 's tax rate and the people produce more than ever before the economy bloom like a plant that have be cut back and could now grow quick and strong our economic program bring about the long peacetime expansion in our history real family income up the poverty rate down entrepreneurship booming and an explosion in research and new technology we be export more than ever because american industry because more competitive and at the same time we summon the national will to knock down protectionist wall abroad instead of erect they at home

 common sense also tell we that to preserve the peace we would have to become strong again after year of weakness and confusion so we rebuilt our defense and this new year we toast the new peacefulness around the globe not only have the superpower actually begin to reduce their stockpile of nuclear weapon and hope for even more progress be bright but the regional conflict that rack the globe be also begin to cease the persian gulf be no long a war zone the soviets be leave afghanistan the vietnamese be prepare to pull out of cambodia and an american mediate accord will soon send 50,000 cuban troop home from angola

 the lesson of all this be of course that because we be a great nation our challenge seem complex it will always be this way but as long as we remember our first principle and believe in ourselves the future will always be ours and something else we learn once you begin a great movement there be no telling where it will end we mean to change a nation and instead we change a world

 country across the globe be turn to free market and free speech and turn away from the ideology of the past for they the great rediscovery of the 1980s have be that lo and behold the moral way of government be the practical way of government democracy the profoundly good be also the profoundly productive

 when you have get to the point when you can celebrate the anniversary of your 39th birthday you can sit back sometimes review your life and see it flow before you for i there be a fork in the river and it be right in the middle of my life i never mean to go into politic it be not my intention when i be young but i be raise to believe you have to pay your way for the blessing bestow on you i be happy with my career in the entertainment world but i ultimately go into politic because i want to protect something precious

 ours be the first revolution in the history of mankind that truly reverse the course of government and with three little word we the people we the people tell the government what to do it do not tell we we the people be the driver the government be the car and we decide where it should go and by what route and how fast almost all the world 's constitution be document in which government tell the people what their privilege be our constitution be a document in which we the people tell the government what it be allow to do we the people be free this belief have be the underlying basis for everything i have try to do these past eight year

 but back in the 1960 when i begin it seem to i that we would begin reverse the order of thing that through more and more rule and regulation and confiscatory taxis the government be take more of our money more of our option and more of our freedom i go into politic in part to put up my hand and say stop i be a citizen politician and it seem the right thing for a citizen to do

 i think we have stop a lot of what need stop and i hope we have once again remind people that man be not free unless government be limited there be a clear cause and effect here that be as neat and predictable as a law of physics as government expand liberty contract

 nothing be less free than pure communism and yet we have the past few year forge a satisfying new closeness with the soviet union i have be ask if this be not a gamble and my answer be no because we be base our action not on word but deed the detente of the 1970 be base not on action but promise they would promise to treat their own people and the people of the world well but the gulag be still the gulag and the state be still expansionist and they still wage proxy war in africa asia and latin america

 well this time so far it be different president gorbachev have bring about some internal democratic reform and begin the withdrawal from afghanistan he have also free prisoner whose name i have give he every time we have meet

 but life have a way of remind you of big thing through small incident once during the heady day of the moscow summit nancy and i decide to break off from the entourage one afternoon to visit the shop on arbat street that be a little street just off moscow 's main shopping area even though our visit be a surprise every russian there immediately recognize we and call out our name and reach for our hand we be just about sweep away by the warmth you could almost feel the possibility in all that joy but within second a kgb detail push their way toward we and begin push and shove the people in the crowd it be an interesting moment it remind i that while the man on the street in the soviet union yearn for peace the government be communist and those who run it be communists and that mean we and they view such issue as freedom and human right very differently

 we must keep up our guard but we must also continue to work together to lessen and eliminate tension and mistrust my view be that president gorbachev be different from previous soviet leader i think he know some of the thing wrong with his society and be try to fix they we wish he well and we will continue to work to make sure that the soviet union that eventually emerge from this process be a less threatening one what it all boil down to be this i want the new closeness to continue and it will as long as we make it clear that we will continue to act in a certain way as long as they continue to act in a helpful manner if and when they do not at first pull your punch if they persist pull the plug it be still trust but verify it be still play but cut the card it be still watch closely and do not be afraid to see what you see

 i have be ask if i have any regret well i do the deficit be one i have be talk a great deal about that lately but tonight be not for argument and i be go to hold my tongue but an observation i have have my share of victory in the congress but what few people notice be that i never win anything you do not win for i they never see my troop they never see reagan 's regiment the american people you win every battle with every call you make and letter you write demand action well action be still need if we be to finish the job reagan 's regiment will have to become the bush brigade soon he will be the chief and he will need you every bit as much as i do

 finally there be a great tradition of warning in presidential farewell and i have get one that be be on my mind for some time but oddly enough it start with one of the thing i be proud of in the past eight year the resurgence of national pride that i call the new patriotism this national feeling be good but it will not count for much and it will not last unless it be ground in thoughtfulness and knowledge

 an informed patriotism be what we want and be we do a good enough job teach our child what america be and what she represent in the long history of the world those of we who be over 35 or so year of age grow up in a different america we be teach very directly what it mean to be an american and we absorb almost in the air a love of country and an appreciation of its institution if you do not get these thing from your family you get they from the neighborhood from the father down the street who fight in korea or the family who lose someone at anzio or you could get a sense of patriotism from school and if all else fail you could get a sense of patriotism from the popular culture the movie celebrate democratic value and implicitly reinforce the idea that america be special tv be like that too through the mid-'60

 but now we be about to enter the 90 and some thing have change young parent be not sure that an unambivalent appreciation of america be the right thing to teach modern child and as for those who create the popular culture well ground patriotism be no long the style our spirit be back but we have not reinstitutionalize it we have get to do a well job of get across that america be freedom freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom of enterprise and freedom be special and rare it be fragile it need production protection

 so we have get to teach history base not on what be in fashion but what be important why the pilgrims come here who jimmy doolittle be and what those 30 second over tokyo mean you know four year ago on the 40th anniversary of d day i read a letter from a young woman write to her late father who have fight on omaha beach her name be lisa zanatta henn and she say we will always remember we will never forget what the boy of normandy do well let us help she keep her word if we forget what we do we will not know who we be i be warn of an eradication of the american memory that could result ultimately in an erosion of the american spirit let us start with some basic more attention to american history and a great emphasis on civic ritual

 and let i offer lesson number one about america all great change in america begin at the dinner table so tomorrow night in the kitchen i hope the talking begin and child if your parent have not be teach you what it mean to be an american let them know and nail them on it that would be a very american thing to do

 and that be about all i have to say tonight except for one thing the past few day when i have be at that window upstairs i have think a bit of the shine city upon a hill the phrase come from john winthrop who write it to describe the america he imagine what he imagine be important because he be an early pilgrim an early freedom man he journey here on what today we would call a little wooden boat and like the other pilgrims he be look for a home that would be free i have speak of the shine city all my political life but i do not know if i ever quite communicate what i see when i say it but in my mind it be a tall proud city build on rock strong than ocean windswept god bless and teem with people of all kind live in harmony and peace a city with free port that hum with commerce and creativity and if there have to be city wall the wall have door and the door be open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here that be how i see it and see it still

 and how stand the city on this winter night more prosperous more secure and happy than it be eight year ago but more than that after 200 year two century she still stand strong and true on the granite ridge and her glow have hold steady no matter what storm and she be still a beacon still a magnet for all who must have freedom for all the pilgrim from all the lose place who be hurtle through the darkness toward home

 we have do our part and as i walk off into the city street a final word to the man and woman of the reagan revolution the man and woman across america who for eight year do the work that bring america back my friend we do it we be not just mark time we make a difference we make the city strong we make the city freer and we leave she in good hand all in all not bad not bad at all

 and so goodbye god bless you and god bless the united states of america

 great nation of the world be move toward democracy through the door to freedom man and woman of the world move toward free market through the door to prosperity the people of the world agitate for free expression and free thought through the door to the moral and intellectual satisfaction that only liberty allow
 we know what work freedom work we know what be right freedom be right we know how to secure a more just and prosperous life for man on earth through free market free speech free election and the exercise of free will unhampere by the state
 for the first time in this century for the first time in perhaps all history man do not have to invent a system by which to live we do not have to talk late into the night about which form of government be well we do not have to wrest justice from the king we only have to summon it from within ourselves we must act on what we know i take as my guide the hope of a saint in crucial thing unity in important thing diversity in all thing generosity
 america today be a proud free nation decent and civil a place we can not help but love we know in our heart not loudly and proudly but as a simple fact that this country have mean beyond what we see and that our strength be a force for good but have we change as a nation even in our time be we enthral with material thing less appreciative of the nobility of work and sacrifice
 my friend we be not the sum of our possession they be not the measure of our life in our heart we know what matter we can not hope only to leave our child a big car a big bank account we must hope to give they a sense of what it mean to be a loyal friend a love parent a citizen who leave his home his neighborhood and town well than he find it and what do we want the man and woman who work with we to say when we be no long there that we be more driven to succeed than anyone around we or that we stop to ask if a sick child have get well and stay a moment there to trade a word of friendship
 no president no government can teach we to remember what be good in what we be but if the man you have choose to lead this government can help make a difference if he can celebrate the quieter deep success that be make not of gold and silk but of well heart and fine soul if he can do these thing then he must
 america be never wholly herself unless she be engage in high moral principle we as a people have such a purpose today it be to make kind the face of the nation and gentler the face of the world my friend we have work to do there be the homeless lost and roam there be the child who have nothing no love and no normalcy there be those who can not free themselves of enslavement to whatever addiction drug welfare the demoralization that rule the slum there be crime to be conquer the rough crime of the street there be young woman to be help who be about to become mother of child they can not care for and might not love they need our care our guidance and our education though we bless they for choose life
 the old solution the old way be to think that public money alone could end these problem but we have learn that that be not so and in any case our fund be low we have a deficit to bring down we have more will than wallet but will be what we need we will make the hard choice look at what we have and perhaps allocate it differently make our decision base on honest need and prudent safety and then we will do the wise thing of all we will turn to the only resource we have that in time of need always grow the goodness and the courage of the american people
 and i be speak of a new engagement in the life of other a new activism hand on and involve that get the job do we must bring in the generation harness the unused talent of the elderly and the unfocused energy of the young for not only leadership be pass from generation to generation but so be stewardship and the generation bear after the second world war have come of age
 i have speak of a thousand points of light of all the community organization that be spread like star throughout the nation do good we will work hand in hand encouraging sometimes lead sometimes be lead rewarding we will work on this in the white house in the cabinet agency i will go to the people and the program that be the bright point of light and i will ask every member of my government to become involved the old idea be new again because they be not old they be timeless duty sacrifice commitment and a patriotism that find its expression in take part and pitch in
 we need a new engagement too between the executive and the congress the challenge before we will be thrash out with the house and the senate and we must bring the federal budget into balance and we must ensure that america stand before the world unite strong at peace and fiscally sound but of course thing may be difficult we need to compromise we have have dissension we need harmony we have have a chorus of discordant voice
 for congress too have change in our time there have grow a certain divisiveness we have see the hard look and hear the statement in which not each other 's idea be challenge but each other 's motive and our great party have too often be far apart and untruste of each other it be be this way since vietnam that war cleave we still but friend that war begin in earnest a quarter of a century ago and surely the statute of limitation have be reach this be a fact the final lesson of vietnam be that no great nation can long afford to be sunder by a memory a new breeze be blow and the old bipartisanship must be make new again
 to my friend and yes i do mean friend in the loyal opposition and yes i mean loyal i put out my hand i be put out my hand to you mr. speaker i be put out my hand to you mr. majority leader for this be the thing this be the age of the offer hand and we can not turn back clock and i do not want to but when our father be young mr. speaker our difference end at the water 's edge and we do not wish to turn back time but when our mother be young mr. majority leader the congress and the executive be capable of work together to produce a budget on which this nation could live let we negotiate soon and hard but in the end let we produce the american people await action they do not send we here to bicker they ask we to rise above the merely partisan in crucial thing unity"—and this my friend be crucial
 to the world too we offer new engagement and a renew vow we will stay strong to protect the peace the offer hand be a reluctant fist once make strong and can be use with great effect there be today americans who be hold against their will in foreign land and americans who be unaccounted for assistance can be show here and will be long remember good will beget good will good faith can be a spiral that endlessly move on
 great nation like great man must keep their word when america say something america mean it whether a treaty or an agreement or a vow make on marble step we will always try to speak clearly for candor be a compliment but subtlety too be good and have its place while keep our alliance and friendship around the world strong ever strong we will continue the new closeness with the soviet union consistent both with our security and with progress one might say that our new relationship in part reflect the triumph of hope and strength over experience but hope be good and so be strength and vigilance
 here today be ten of thousand of our citizen who feel the understandable satisfaction of those who have take part in democracy and see their hope fulfil but my thought have be turn the past few day to those who would be watch at home to an old fellow who will throw a salute by himself when the flag go by and the woman who will tell her son the word of the battle hymn i do not mean this to be sentimental i mean that on day like this we remember that we be all part of a continuum inescapably connect by the tie that bind
 our child be watch in school throughout our great land and to they i say thank you for watch democracy 's big day for democracy belong to we all and freedom be like a beautiful kite that can go higher and high with the breeze and to all i say no matter what your circumstance or where you be you be part of this day you be part of the life of our great nation
 a president be neither prince nor pope and i do not seek a window on man 's soul in fact i yearn for a great tolerance and easygoingness about each other 's attitude and way of life
 there be few clear area in which we as a society must rise up united and express our intolerance the most obvious now be drug and when that first cocaine be smuggle in on a ship it may as well have be a deadly bacteria so much have it hurt the body the soul of our country and there be much to be do and to be say but take my word for it this scourge will stop
 and so there be much to do and tomorrow the work begin and i do not mistrust the future i do not fear what be ahead for our problem be large but our heart be large our challenge be great but our will be great and if our flaw be endless god 's love be truly boundless
 some see leadership as high drama and the sound of trumpet call and sometimes it be that but i see history as a book with many page and each day we fill a page with act of hopefulness and meaning the new breeze blow a page turn the story unfold and so today a chapter begin a small and stately story of unity diversity and generosity share and write together
 thank you god bless you and god bless the united states of america

mr. speaker mr. president and distinguish member of the house and senate honored guest and fellow citizen less than 3 week ago i join you on the west front of this very building and look over the monument to our proud past offer you my hand in fill the next page of american history with a story of extended prosperity and continued peace and tonight i be back to offer you my plan as well the hand remain extend the sleeve be roll up america be wait and now we must produce together we can build a well america
 it be comfort to return to this historic chamber here 22 year ago i first raise my hand to be swear into public life so tonight i feel as if i be return home to friend and i intend in the month and year to come to give you what friend deserve frankness respect and my good judgment about way to improve america 's future in return i ask for an honest commitment to our common mission of progress if we seize the opportunity on the road before we there will be praise enough for all the people do not send we here to bicker and it be time to govern
 and many president have come to this chamber in time of great crisis war and depression loss of national spirit and 8 year ago i sit in that very chair as president reagan speak of punish inflation and devastatingly high interest rate and people out of work american confidence on the wane and our challenge be different we be fortunate a much change landscape lie before we tonight so i do not propose to reverse direction we be head the right way but we can not rest we be a people whose energy and drive have fuel our rise to greatness and we be a forward look nation generous yes but ambitious not for ourselves but for the world complacency be not in our character not before not now not ever
 and so tonight we must take a strong america and make it even well we must address some very real problem we must establish some very clear priority and we must make a very substantial cut in the federal budget deficit some people find that agenda impossible but i be present to you tonight a realistic plan for tackle it my plan have four broad feature attention to urgent priority investment in the future an attack on the deficit and no new taxis this budget represent my good judgment of how we can address our priority there be many area in which we would all like to spend more than i propose i understand that but we can not until we get our fiscal house in order
 next year alone thank to economic growth without any change in the law the federal government will take in over $ 80 billion more than it do this year that be right over $ 80 billion in new revenue with no increase in taxis and our job be to allocate those new resource wisely we can afford to increase spending by a modest amount but enough to invest in key priority and still cut the deficit by almost 40 percent in 1 year and that will allow we to meet the target set forth in the gramm rudman hollings law but to do that we must recognize that growth above inflation in federal program be not preordain that not all spending initiative be design to be immortal
 i make this pledge tonight my team and i be ready to work with the congress to form a special leadership group to negotiate in good faith to work day and night if that be what it take to meet the budget target and to produce a budget on time
 we can not settle for business as usual government by continue resolution or government by crisis will not do and i ask the congress tonight to approve several measure which will make budgeting more sensible we could save time and improve efficiency by enact 2 year budget forty three governors have the line item veto president should have it too and at the very least when a president propose to rescind federal spending the congress should be require to vote on that proposal instead of kill it by inaction and i ask the congress to honor the public 's wish by pass a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget such an amendment once phase in will discipline both the congress and the executive branch
 several principle describe the kind of america i hope to build with your help in the year ahead we will not have the luxury of take the easy spendthrift approach to solve problem because high spending and high taxis put economic growth at risk economic growth provide job and hope economic growth enable we to pay for social program economic growth enhance the security of the nation and low tax rate create economic growth
 i believe in give americans great freedom and great choice and i will work for choice for american family whether in the housing in which they live the school to which they send their child or the child care they select for their young you see i believe that we have an obligation to those in need but that government should not be the provider of first resort for thing that the private sector can produce well i believe in a society that be free from discrimination and bigotry of any kind and i will work to knock down the barrier leave by past discrimination and to build a more tolerant society that will stop such barrier from ever be build again
 i believe that family and faith represent the moral compass of the nation and i will work to make they strong for as benjamin franklin say if a sparrow can not fall to the ground without his notice can a great nation rise without his aid and i believe in give people the power to make their own life well through growth and opportunity and together let us put power in the hand of people
 three week ago we celebrate the bicentennial inaugural the 200th anniversary of the first presidency and if you look back one thing be so strike about the way the founding fathers look at america they do not talk about themselves they talk about posterity they talk about the future and we too must think in term big than ourselves we must take action today that will ensure a well tomorrow we must extend american leadership in technology increase long term investment improve our educational system and boost productivity these be the key to build a well future and here be some of my recommendation
 i propose almost $ 2.2 billion for the national science foundation to promote basic research and keep we on track to double its budget by 1993
 i propose to make permanent the tax credit for research and development
 i have ask vice president quayle to chair a new task force on competitiveness
 and i request funding for nasa national aeronautics and space administration and a strong space program an increase of almost $ 2.4 billion over the current fiscal year we must have a man space station a vigorous safe space shuttle program and more commercial development in space the space program should always go full throttle up and that be not just our ambition it be our destiny
 i propose that we cut the maximum tax rate on capital gain to increase long term investment history on this be clear this will increase revenue help saving and create new job we will not be competitive if we leave whole sector of america behind this be the year we should finally enact urban enterprise zone and bring hope to the inner city
 but the most important competitiveness program of all be one which improve education in america when some of our student actually have trouble locate america on a map of the world it be time for we to map a new approach to education we must reward excellence and cut through bureaucracy we must help school that need help the most we must give choice to parent student teacher and principal and we must hold all concerned accountable in education we can not tolerate mediocrity i want to cut that dropout rate and make america a more literate nation because what it really come down to be this the long our graduation line be today the short our unemployment line will be tomorrow
 so tonight i be propose the following initiative the beginning of a $ 500 million program to reward america 's good school merit school the creation of special presidential award for the good teacher in every state because excellence should be reward the establishment of a new program of national science scholars one each year for every member of the house and senate to give this generation of student a special incentive to excel in science and mathematic the expand use of magnet school which give family and student great choice and a new program to encourage alternative certification which will let talented people from all field teach in our classroom i have say i would like to be the education president and tonight i would ask you to join i by become the education congress
 just last week as i settle into this new office i receive a letter from a mother in pennsylvania who have be strike by my message in the inaugural address not 12 hour before she write my husband and = i receive word that our son be addict to cocaine he have the world at his foot bright gifted personable he could have do anything with his life and now he have choose cocaine and please she write find a way to curb the supply of cocaine get tough with the pusher our son need your help
 my friend that voice cry out for help could be the voice of your own neighbor your own friend your own son over 23 million americans use illegal drug last year at a staggering cost to our nation 's well being let this be record as the time when america rise up and say no to drug the scourge of drug must be stop and i be ask tonight for an increase of almost a billion dollar in budget outlay to escalate the war against drug the war must be wage on all front our new drug czar bill bennett and i will be shoulder to shoulder in the executive branch lead the charge
 some money will be use to expand treatment to the poor and to young mother this will offer the help hand to the many innocent victim of drug like the thousand of baby bear addict or with aids because of the mother 's addiction some will be use to cut the wait time for treatment some money will be devoted to those urban school where the emergency be now the bad and much of it will be use to protect our border with help from the coast guard and the customs service the departments of state and justice and yes the u.s. military
 i mean to get tough on the drug criminal and let i be clear this president will back up those who put their life on the line every single day our local police officer my budget ask for beefed up prosecution for a new attack on organized crime and for enforcement of tough sentence and for the bad kingpin that mean the death penalty i also want to make sure that when a drug dealer be convict there be a cell wait for he and he should not go free because prison be too full and so let the word go out if you be catch and convict you will do time
 but for all we do in law enforcement in interdiction and treatment we will never win this war on drug unless we stop the demand for drug so some of this increase will be use to educate the young about the danger of drug we must involve the parent we must involve the teacher we must involve the community and my friend we must involve ourselves each and every one of we in this concern
 one problem relate to drug use demand our urgent attention and our continue compassion and that be the terrible tragedy of aids i be ask for $ 1.6 billion for education to prevent the disease and for research to find a cure
 if we be to protect our future we need a new attitude about the environment we must protect the air we breathe i will send to you shortly legislation for a new more effective clean air act it will include a plan to reduce by date certain the emission which cause acid rain because the time for study alone have pass and the time for action be now we must make use of clean coal my budget contain full funding on schedule for the clean coal technology agreement that we have make with canada we have make that agreement with canada and we intend to honor that agreement we must not neglect our park so i be ask to fund new acquisition under the land and water conservation fund we must protect our ocean and i support new penalty against those who would dump medical waste and other trash into our ocean the age of the needle on the beach must end
 and in some case the gulfs and ocean off our shore hold the promise of oil and gas reserve which can make our nation more secure and less dependent on foreign oil and when those with the most promise can be tap safely as with much of the alaska national wildlife refuge we should proceed but we must use caution we must respect the environment and so tonight i be call for the indefinite postponement of three lease sale which have raise troubling question two off the coast of california and one which could threaten the everglade in florida action on these three lease sale will await the conclusion of a special task force set up to measure the potential for environmental damage
 i be direct the attorney general and the administrator of the environmental protection agency to use every tool at their disposal to speed and toughen the enforcement of our law against toxic waste dumper i want fast cleanup and tough enforcement of penalty against polluter
 in addition to care for our future we must care for those around we a decent society show compassion for the young the elderly the vulnerable and the poor our first obligation be to the most vulnerable infant poor mother child live in poverty and my propose budget recognize this i ask for full funding of medicaid an increase of over $ 3 billion and an expansion of the program to include coverage of pregnant woman who be near the poverty line i believe we should help work family cope with the burden of child care our help should be aim at those who need it most low income family with young child i support a new child care tax credit that will aim our effort at exactly those family without discriminate against mother who choose to stay at home
 now i know there be compete proposal but remember this the overwhelming majority of all preschool child care be now provide by relative and neighbor and church and community group family who choose these option should remain eligible for help parent should have choice and for those child who be unwanted or abuse or whose parent be deceased we should encourage adoption i propose to reenact the tax deduction for adoption expense and to double it to $ 3,000 let us make it easy for these kid to have parent who love they
 we have a moral contract with our senior citizen and in this budget social security be fully fund include a full cost of living adjustment we must honor our contract
 we must care about those in the shadow of life and i like many americans be deeply trouble by the plight of the homeless the cause of homelessness be many the history be long but the moral imperative to act be clear thank to the deep well of generosity in this great land many organization already contribute but we in government can not stand on the sideline in my budget i ask for great support for emergency food and shelter for health service and measure to prevent substance abuse and for clinic for the mentally ill and i propose a new initiative involve the full range of government agency we must confront this national shame
 there be another issue that i have decide to mention here tonight i have long believe that the people of puerto rico should have the right to determine their own political future personally i strongly favor statehood but i urge the congress to take the necessary step to allow the people to decide in a referendum
 certain problem the result of decade of unwise practice threaten the health and security of our people leave unattended they will only get bad but we can act now to put they behind we
 early this week i announce my support for a plan to restore the financial and moral integrity of our saving system i ask congress to enact our reform proposal within 45 day we must not let this situation fester we owe it to the saver in this country to solve this problem certainly the saving of americans must remain secure let i be clear insured depositor will continue to be fully protect but any plan to refinance the system must be accompany by major reform our proposal will prevent such a crisis from recur the good answer be to make sure that a mess like this will never happen again the majority of thrift in community across the nation have be honest they have play a major role in help family achieve the dream of home ownership but make no mistake those who be corrupt those who break the law must be kick out of the business and they should go to jail
 we face a massive task in clean up the waste leave from decade of environmental neglect at america 's nuclear weapon plant clearly we must modernize these plant and operate they safely that be not at issue our national security depend on it but beyond that we must clean up the old mess that be be leave behind and i propose in this budget to more than double our current effort to do so this will allow we to identify the exact nature of the various problem so we can clean they up and clean they up we will
 we have be fortunate during these past 8 year america be a strong nation than it be in 1980 morale in our armed forces have be restore our resolve have be show our readiness have be improve and we be at peace there can no long be any doubt that peace have be make more secure through strength and when america be strong the world be safe
 most people do not realize that after the successful restoration of our strength the pentagon budget have actually be reduce in real term for each of the last 4 year we can not tolerate continued real reduction in defense in light of the compelling need to reduce the deficit however i support a 1 year freeze in the military budget something i propose last fall in my flexible freeze plan and this freeze will apply for only 1 year and after that increase above inflation will be require i will not sacrifice american preparedness and i will not compromise american strength
 i should be clear on the condition attach to my recommendation for the come year the saving must be allocate to those priority for invest in our future that i have speak about tonight this defense freeze must be a part of a comprehensive budget agreement which meet the target spell out in gramm rudman hollings law without raise taxis and which incorporate reform in the budget process
 i have direct the national security council to review our national security and defense policy and report back to i within 90 day to ensure that our capability and resource meet our commitment and strategy i be also charge the department of defense with the task of develop a plan to improve the defense procurement process and management of the pentagon one which will fully implement the packard commission report many of these change can only be make with the participation of the congress and so i ask for your help we need few regulation we need less bureaucracy we need multiyear procurement and 2 year budgeting and frankly and do not take this wrong we need less congressional micromanagement of our nation 's military policy i detect a slight division on that question but nevertheless—[laughter
 secure a more peaceful world be perhaps the most important priority i would like to address tonight you know we meet at a time of extraordinary hope never before in this century have our value of freedom democracy and economic opportunity be such a powerful and intellectual force around the globe never before have our leadership be so crucial because while america have its eye on the future the world have its eye on america
 and it be a time of great change in the world and especially in the soviet union prudence and common sense dictate that we try to understand the full meaning of the change go on there review our policy and then proceed with caution but i have personally assure general secretary gorbachev that at the conclusion of such a review we will be ready to move forward we will not miss any opportunity to work for peace the fundamental fact remain that the soviets retain a very powerful military machine in the service of objective which be still too often in conflict with ours so let we take the new openness seriously but let us also be realistic and let us always be strong
 there be some press issue we must address i will vigorously pursue the strategic defense initiative the spread and even use of sophisticated weaponry threaten global security as never before chemical weapon must be ban from the face of the earth never to be use again and look this will not be easy verification extraordinarily difficult but civilization and human decency demand that we try and the spread of nuclear weapon must be stop and i will work to strengthen the hand of the international atomic energy agency our diplomacy must work every day against the proliferation of nuclear weapon
 and around the globe we must continue to be freedom 's good friend and we must stand firm for self determination and democracy in central america include in nicaragua it be my strongly hold conviction that when people be give the chance they inevitably will choose a free press freedom of worship and certifiably free and fair election
 we must strengthen the alliance of the industrial democracy as solid a force for peace as the world have ever know and this be an alliance forge by the power of our ideal not the pettiness of our difference so let us lift our sight to rise above fight about beef hormone to build a well future to move from protectionism to progress
 i have ask the secretary of state to visit europe next week and to consult with our ally on the wide range of challenge and opportunity we face together include east west relation and i look forward to meet with our nato partner in the near future
 and i too shall begin a trip shortly to the far reach of the pacific basin where the wind of democracy be create new hope and the power of free market be unleash a new force when i serve as our representative in china 14 or 15 year ago few would have predict the scope of the change we have witness since then but in prepare for this trip i be strike by something i come across from a chinese writer he be speak of his country decade ago but his word speak to each of we in america tonight today he say we be afraid of the simple word like goodness and mercy and kindness my friend if we be to succeed as a nation we must rediscover those word
 in just 3 day we mark the birthday of abraham lincoln the man who save our union and give new meaning to the word opportunity lincoln once say i hold that while man exist it be his duty to improve not only his own condition but to assist in ameliorate that of mankind it be this broad mission to which i call all americans because the definition of a successful life must include serve other
 and to the young people of america who sometimes feel left out i ask you tonight to give we the benefit of your talent and energy through a new program call yes for youth entering service to america
 to those man and woman in business remember the ultimate end of your work to make a well product to create well life i ask you to plan for the long term and avoid that temptation of quick and easy paper profit
 to the brave man and woman who wear the uniform of the united states of america thank you your calling be a high one to be the defender of freedom and the guarantor of liberty and i want you to know that this nation be grateful for your service
 to the farmer of america we appreciate the bounty you provide we will work with you to open foreign market to american agricultural product
 and to the parent of america i ask you to get involve in your child 's schooling check on the homework go to the school meet the teacher care about what be happen there it be not only your child 's future on the line it be america 's
 to kid in our city do not give up hope say no to drug stay in school and yes keep hope alive
 to those 37 million americans with some form of disability you belong in the economic mainstream we need your talent in america 's work force disabled americans must become full partner in america 's opportunity society
 to the family of america watch tonight in your live room hold fast to your dream because ultimately america 's future rest in your hand
 and to my friend in this chamber i ask your cooperation to keep america grow while cut the deficit that be only fair to those who now have no vote the generation to come let they look back and say that we have the foresight to understand that a time of peace and prosperity be not the time to rest but a time to press forward a time to invest in the future
 and let all americans remember that no problem of human making be too great to be overcome by human ingenuity human energy and the untiring hope of the human spirit i believe this i would not have ask to be your president if i do not and tomorrow the debate on the plan i have put forward begin and i ask the congress to come forward with your own proposal let us not question each other 's motive let us debate let us negotiate but let we solve the problem
 recall anniversary may not be my specialty in speeches—[laughter]—but tonight be one of some note on february 9th 1941 just 48 year ago tonight sir winston churchill take to the airwave during britain 's hour of peril he have receive from president roosevelt a hand carry letter quote longfellow 's famous poem sail on o ship of state sail on o union strong and great humanity with all its fear with all the hope of future year be hang breathless on thy fate and churchill respond on this night by radio broadcast to a nation at war but he direct his word to franklin roosevelt we shall not fail or falter he say we shall not weaken or tire give we the tool and we will finish the job
 tonight almost half a century later our peril may be less immediate but the need for perseverance and clear sighted fortitude be just as great now as then there be those who say it can not be do there be voice who say that america 's good day have pass that we be bind by constraint threaten by problem surround by trouble which limit our ability to hope well tonight i remain full of hope we americans have only begin on our mission of goodness and greatness and to those timid soul i repeat the plea give we the tool and we will do the job
 thank you god bless you and god bless america

thank you governor thank you all very much for that welcome good luck good luck to you thank you lady and gentleman thank you all chairman mckenzie and dr. adkisson and dr. mobley thank you for have i here and to the singing cadets thank you for that very special treat and to my secretary of commerce bob mosbacher i be delighted that he be with i today

 i want to pay my special respect to our governor bill clements to your congressman from this district joe barton and then of course to senator phil gramm he say he teach economic here and in congress it be hard to be humble but nevertheless—[laughter]—the point be the guy 's tell the truth and we be grateful to he every day for his leadership up there in washington as we be for joe barton as well so we have get a good combination phil gramm in the senate and today joe barton in the united states congress a wonderful combination with these aggie value in the forefront

 i be bring here today by an aggie and i bring he here to this marvelous ceremony with i he be mention by congressman barton but i would like to ask the pilot of air force one lieutenant colonel dan barr to stand up so you can see another aggie all suit up up there and you meet my day to day inside aggie fred mcclure we work every minute of the day on matter affect the legislative interest of this country but i will not reintroduce fred but i be delighted to be back among my fellow texans and friend and for those of you who be democrats there be no truth to the rumor that phil gramm and i be ready to take our elephant walk applause

 my sincere congratulation go to every graduate and to your parent in this ceremony we celebrate nothing less than the commencement of the rest and the good of your life and when you look back at your day at texas a&amp;m you will have a lot to be proud of a university that be first in baseball and first in service to our nation many be the hero whose name be call at muster many be those you remember in silver taps

 we be remind that no generation can escape history parent we share a fervent desire for our child and their child to know a well world a safe world and student your parent and grandparent have live through a world war and help america to rebuild the world they witness the drama of postwar nation divide by soviet subversion and force but sustain by an ally response most vividly see in the berlin airlift and today i would like to use this joyous and solemn occasion to speak to you and to the rest of the country about our relation with the soviet union it be fitting that these remark be make here at texas a&amp;m university

 wise man truman and eisenhower vandenberg and rayburn marshall acheson and kennan craft the strategy of containment they believe that the soviet union deny the easy course of expansion would turn inward and address the contradiction of its inefficient repressive and inhumane system and they be right the soviet union be now publicly face this hard reality containment work containment work because our democratic principle and institution and value be sound and always have be it work because our alliance be and be strong and because the superiority of free society and free market over stagnant socialism be undeniable

 we be approach the conclusion of an historic postwar struggle between two vision one of tyranny and conflict and one of democracy and freedom the review of u.s.-soviet relation that my administration have just complete outline a new path toward resolve this struggle our goal be bold more ambitious than any of my predecessor could have think possible our review indicate that 40 year of perseverance have bring we a precious opportunity and now it be time to move beyond containment to a new policy for the 1990 one that recognize the full scope of change take place around the world and in the soviet union itself in sum the united states now have as its goal much more than simply contain soviet expansionism we seek the integration of the soviet union into the community of nation and as the soviet union itself move toward great openness and democratization as they meet the challenge of responsible international behavior we will match their step with step of our own ultimately our objective be to welcome the soviet union back into the world order

 the soviet union say that it seek to make peace with the world and criticize its own postwar policy these be word that we can only applaud but a new relationship can not simply be declare by moscow or bestow by other it must be earn it must be earn because promise be never enough the soviet union have promise a more cooperative relationship before only to reverse course and return to militarism soviet foreign policy have be almost seasonal warmth before cold thaw before freeze we seek a friendship that know no season of suspicion no chill of distrust

 we hope perestroika be point the soviet union to a break with the cycle of the past a definitive break who would have think that we would see the deliberation of the central committee on the front page of pravda or dissident andrei sakharov seat near the council of power who would have imagine a soviet leader who canvass the sidewalk of moscow and also washington d.c. these be hopeful indeed remarkable sign and let no one doubt our sincere desire to see perestroika this reform continue and succeed but the national security of america and our ally be not predicate on hope it must be base on deed and we look for endure ingrained economic and political change

 while we hope to move beyond containment we be only at the beginning of our new path many danger and uncertainty be ahead we must not forget that the soviet union have acquire awesome military capability that be a fact of life for my predecessor and that be always be a fact of life for our ally and that be a fact of life for i today as president of the united states

 as we seek peace we must also remain strong the purpose of our military might be not to pressure a weak soviet economy or to seek military superiority it be to deter war it be to defend ourselves and our ally and to do something more to convince the soviet union that there can be no reward in pursue expansionism to convince the soviet union that reward lie in the pursuit of peace

 western policy must encourage the evolution of the soviet union toward an open society this task will test our strength it will tax our patience and it will require a sweeping vision let i share with you my vision i see a western hemisphere of democratic prosperous nation no long threaten by a cuba or a nicaragua arm by moscow i see a soviet union as it pull away from tie to terrorist nation like libya that threaten the legitimate security of their neighbor i see a soviet union which respect china 's integrity and return the northern territory to japan a prelude to the day when all the great nation of asia will live in harmony

 but the fulfillment of this vision require the soviet union to take positive step include first reduce soviet force although some small step have already be take the warsaw pact still possess more than 30,000 tank more than twice as much artillery and hundred of thousand more troop in europe than nato they should cut their force to less threatening level in proportion to their legitimate security need

 second adhere to the soviet obligation promise in the final day of world war ii to support self determination for all the nation of eastern europe and central europe and this require specific abandonment of the brezhnev doctrine one day it should be possible to drive from moscow to munich without see a single guard tower or a strand of barbed wire in short tear down the iron curtain

 and third work with the west in positive practical not merely rhetorical step toward diplomatic solution to these regional dispute around the world i welcome the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan and the angola agreement but there be much more to be do around the world we be ready let us roll up our sleeve and get to work

 and fourth achieve a lasting political pluralism and respect for human right dramatic event have already occur in moscow we be impress by limited but freely contest election we be impress by a great toleration of dissent we be impress by a new frankness about the stalin era mr. gorbachev do not stop now

 and fifth join with we in address press global problem include the international drug menace and danger to the environment we can build a well world for our child

 as the soviet union move toward arm reduction and reform it will find willing partner in the west we seek verifiable stabilize arm control and arm reduction agreement with the soviet union and its ally however arm control be not an end in itself but a mean of contribute to the security of america and the peace of the world i direct secretary of state baker to propose to the soviets that we resume negotiation on strategic force in june and as you know the soviet union have agree

 our basic approach be clear in the strategic arm reduction talk we wish to reduce the risk of nuclear war and in the companion defense and space talk our objective will be to preserve our option to deploy advanced defense when they be ready in nuclear testing we will continue to seek the necessary verification improvement in exist treaty to permit they to be bring into force and we be go to continue to seek a verifiable global ban on chemical weapon we support nato effort to reduce the soviet offensive threat in the negotiation on conventional force in europe and as i have say fundamental to all of these objective be simple openness

 make no mistake a new breeze be blow across the steppe and the city of the soviet union why not then let this spirit of openness grow let more barrier come down open emigration open debate open airwave let openness come to mean the publication and sale of ban book and newspaper in the soviet union let the 19,000 soviet jews who emigrate last year be follow by any number who wish to emigrate this year and when people apply for exit visa let there be no harassment against they let openness come to mean nothing less than the free exchange of people and book and idea between east and west

 and let it come to mean one thing more thirty four year ago president eisenhower meet in geneva with soviet leader who after the death of stalin promise a new approach toward the west he propose a plan call open skies which would allow unarmed aircraft from the united states and the soviet union to fly over the territory of the other country this would open up military activity to regular scrutiny and as president eisenhower put it convince the world that we be lessen danger and relax tension president eisenhower 's suggestion test the soviet readiness to open their society and the kremlin fail that test

 now let we again explore that proposal but on a broad more intrusive and radical basis one which i hope would include ally on both side we suggest that those country that wish to examine this proposal meet soon to work out the necessary operational detail separately from other arm control negotiation such surveillance flight complement satellite would provide regular scrutiny for both side such unprecedented territorial access would show the world the true meaning of the concept of openness the very soviet willingness to embrace such a concept would reveal their commitment to change

 where there be cooperation there can be a broad economic relationship but economic relation have be stifle by soviet internal policy they have be injure by moscow 's practice of use the cloak of commerce to steal technology from the west end discriminatory treatment of u.s. firm would be a helpful step trade and financial transaction should take place on a normal commercial basis

 and should the soviet union codify its emigration law in accord with international standard and implement its new law faithfully i be prepared to work with congress for a temporary waiver of the jackson vanik amendment open the way to extend most favor nation trade status to the soviet union after that last weighty point i can just imagine what you be think it have to happen your last day in college have to end with yet another political science lecture laughter

 in all seriousness the policy i have just describe have everything to do with you today you graduate you be go to start career and family and you will become the leader of america in the next century and what kind of world will you know perhaps the world order of the future will truly be a family of nation

 it be a sad truth that nothing force we to recognize our common humanity more swiftly than a natural disaster i be think of course of soviet armenia just a few month ago a tragedy without blame warlike devastation without war our son take our 12 year old grandson to yerevan at the end of the day of comfort the injured and console the bereaved the father and son go to church sit down together in the midst of the ruin and weep how can our two country magnify this simple expression of care how can we convey the good will of our people

 forty three year ago a young lieutenant by the name of albert kotzebue the class of 1945 at texas a&amp;m be the first american soldier to shake hand with the soviets at the bank of the elbe river once again we be ready to extend our hand once again we be ready for a hand in return and once again it be a time for peace

 thank you for invite i to texas a&amp;m. i wish you the very good in year to come god bless you all thank you very much

 these investment will keep america competitive and i know this about the american people we welcome competition we will match our ingenuity our energy our experience and technology our spirit and enterprise against anyone but let the competition be free but let it also be fair america be ready

 and there be something more we owe the generation of the future stewardship the safekeeping of america 's precious environmental inheritance it be just one sign of how serious we be we will elevate the environmental protection agency to cabinet rank not more bureaucracy not more redtape but the certainty that here at home and especially in our dealing with other nation environmental issue have the status they deserve

 we rescue the system in 1983 and it be sound again bipartisan arrangement our budget fully fund today 's benefit and it assure that future benefit will be fund as well the last thing we need to do be mess around with social security

 there be one more problem we need to address we must give careful consideration to the recommendation of the health care study underway now that be why tonight i be ask dr. sullivan lou sullivan secretary of health and human services to lead a domestic policy council review of recommendation on the quality accessibility and cost of our nation 's health care system i be commit to bring the staggering cost of health care under control

 the state of the government do indeed depend on many of we in this very chamber but the state of the union depend on all americans we must maintain the democratic decency that make a nation out of million of individual i have be appal at the recent mail bombing across this country every one of we must confront and condemn racism anti semitism bigotry and hate not next week not tomorrow but right now every single one of we

 the state of the union depend on whether we help our neighbor claim the problem of our community as our own we have get to step forward when there be trouble lend a hand be what i call a point of light to a stranger in need we have get to take the time after a busy day to sit down and read with our kid help they with their homework pass along the value we learn as child that be how we sustain the state of the union every effort be important it all add up it be do the thing that give democracy meaning it all add up to who we be and who we will be

 let i say that so long as we remember the american idea so long as we live up to the american ideal the state of the union will remain sound and strong

 and to those who worry that we have lose our way well i want you to listen to part of a letter write by private first class james markwell a 20 year old army medic of the 1st battalion 75th ranger it be date december 18 the night before our armed force go into action in panama it be a letter servicemen write and hope will never be send and sadly private markwell 's mother do receive this letter she pass it along to i out there in cincinnati

 and here be some of what he write i have never be afraid of death but i know he be wait at the corner i have be train to kill and to save and so have everyone else i be frightened what lay beyond the fog and yet do not mourn for i revel in the life that i have die to give you but most of all do not forget the army be my choice something that i want to do remember i join the army to serve my country and ensure that you be free to do what you want and live your life freely

 let i add that private markwell be among the first to see battle in panama and one of the first to fall but he know what he believe in he carry the idea we call america in his heart

 i begin tonight speak about the change we have see this past year there be a new world of challenge and opportunity before we and there be a need for leadership that only america can provide nearly 40 year ago in his last address to the congress president harry truman predict such a time would come he say as our world grow strong more united more attractive to man on both side of the iron curtain then inevitably there will come a time of change within the communist world today that change be take place

 for more than 40 year america and its ally hold communism in check and ensure that democracy would continue to exist and today with communism crumble our aim must be to ensure democracy 's advance to take the lead in forge peace and freedom 's good hope a great and grow commonwealth of free nation and to the congress and to all americans i say it be time to acclaim a new consensus at home and abroad a common vision of the peaceful world we want to see

 here in our own hemisphere it be time for all the people of the americas north and south to live in freedom in the far east and africa it be time for the full flowering of free government and free market that have serve as the engine of progress it be time to offer our hand to the emerge democracy of eastern europe so that continent for too long a continent divide can see a future whole and free it be time to build on our new relationship with the soviet union to endorse and encourage a peaceful process of internal change toward democracy and economic opportunity

 we be in a period of great transition great hope and yet great uncertainty we recognize that the soviet military threat in europe be diminish but we see little change in soviet strategic modernization therefore we must sustain our own strategic offense modernization and the strategic defense initiative

 but the time be right to move forward on a conventional arm control agreement to move we to more appropriate level of military force in europe a coherent defense program that ensure the u.s. will continue to be a catalyst for peaceful change in europe and i have consult with leader of nato in fact i speak by phone with president gorbachev just today

 i agree with our european ally that an american military presence in europe be essential and that it should not be tie solely to the soviet military presence in eastern europe but our troop level can still be low and so tonight i be announce a major new step for a further reduction in u.s. and soviet manpower in central and eastern europe to 195,000 on each side this level reflect the advice of our senior military adviser it be design to protect american and european interest and sustain nato 's defense strategy a swift conclusion to our arm control talk conventional chemical and strategic must now be our goal and that time have come

 still we must recognize an unfortunate fact in many region of the world tonight the reality be conflict not peace endure animosity and oppose interest remain and thus the cause of peace must be serve by an america strong enough and sure enough to defend our interest and our ideal it be this american idea that for the past four decade help inspire this revolution of 89

 here at home and in the world there be history in the making history to be make six month ago early in this season of change i stand at the gate of the gdansk shipyard in poland at the monument to the fallen worker of solidarity it be a monument of simple majesty three tall crosse rise up from the stone and atop each cross an anchor an ancient symbol of hope

 the anchor in our world today be freedom hold we steady in time of change a symbol of hope to all the world and freedom be at the very heart of the idea that be america give life to that idea depend on every one of we our anchor have always be faith and family

 in the last few day of this past momentous year our family be bless once more celebrate the joy of life when a little boy become our 12th grandchild when i hold the little guy for the first time the trouble at home and abroad seem manageable and totally in perspective

 now i know you be probably think well that be just a grandfather talk well maybe you be right but i have meet a lot of child this past year across this country as all of you have everywhere from the far east to eastern europe and all kid be unique and yet all kid be alike the bud young environmentalist i meet this month who join i in explore the florida everglades the little leaguer i play catch with in poland ready to go from warsaw to the world series and even the kid who be ill or alone and god bless those boarder baby bear addict to drug and aids and cope with problem no child should have to face but you know when it come to hope and the future every kid be the same full of dream ready to take on the world all special because they be the very future of freedom and to they belong this new world i have be speak about

 this historic act be the world 's first comprehensive declaration of equality for people with disability the first its passage have make the united states the international leader on this human right issue already leader of several other country include sweden japan the soviet union and all 12 member of the eec have announce that they hope to enact now similar legislation

 our success with this act prove that we be keep faith with the spirit of our courageous forefather who write in the declaration of independence we hold these truth to be self evident that all man be create equal that they be endow by their creator with certain unalienable right these word have be our guide for more than two century as we have labor to form our more perfect union but tragically for too many americans the blessing of liberty have be limit or even deny the civil rights act of 64 take a bold step towards right that wrong but the stark fact remain that people with disability be still victim of segregation and discrimination and this be intolerable today 's legislation bring we close to that day when no americans will ever again be deprive of their basic guarantee of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness

 this act be powerful in its simplicity it will ensure that people with disability be give the basic guarantee for which they have work so long and so hard independence freedom of choice control of their life the opportunity to blend fully and equally into the rich mosaic of the american mainstream legally it will provide our disabled community with a powerful expansion of protection and then basic civil right it will guarantee fair and just access to the fruit of american life which we all must be able to enjoy and then specifically first the ada ensure that employer cover by the act can not discriminate against qualified individual with disability second the ada ensure access to public accommodation such as restaurant hotel shopping center and office and third the ada ensure expand access to transportation service and fourth the ada ensure equivalent telephone service for people with speech or hearing impediment

 together we must remove the physical barrier we have create and the social barrier that we have accept for our will never be a truly prosperous nation until all within it prosper for inspiration we need look no far than our own neighbor with we in that wonderful crowd out there be people represent 18 of the daily points of light that i have name for their extraordinary involvement with the disabled community we applaud you and your shine example thank you for your leadership for all that be here today

 now let i just tell you a wonderful story a story about child already work in the spirit of the ada a story that really touch i across the nation some 10,000 youngster with disability be part of little league 's challenger division their team play just like other but and this be the most remarkable part as they play at their side be volunteer buddy from conventional little league team all of these player work together they team up to wheel around the basis and to field grounder together and most of all just to play and become friend we must let these child be our guide and inspiration

 i also want to say a special word to our friend in the business community you have in your hand the key to the success of this act for you can unlock a splendid resource of untapped human potential that when free will enrich we all i know there have be concern that the ada may be vague or costly or may lead endlessly to litigation but i want to reassure you right now that my administration and the united states congress have carefully craft this act we have all be determined to ensure that it give flexibility particularly in term of the timetable of implementation and we have be commit to contain the cost that may be incur

 this act do something important for american business though and remember this you have call for new source of worker well many of our fellow citizen with disability be unemployed they want to work and they can work and this be a tremendous pool of people and remember this be a tremendous pool of people who will bring to job diversity loyalty prove low turnover rate and only one request the chance to prove themselves and when you add together federal state local and private fund it cost almost $ 200 billion annually to support americans with disability in effect to keep they dependent well when give the opportunity to be independent they will move proudly into the economic mainstream of american life and that be what this legislation be all about

 our problem be large but our unified heart be large our challenge be great but our will be great and in our america the most generous optimistic nation on the face of the earth we must not and will not rest until every man and woman with a dream have the mean to achieve it

 and today america welcome into the mainstream of life all of our fellow citizen with disability we embrace you for your ability and for your disability for our similarity and indeed for our difference for your past courage and your future dream last year we celebrate a victory of international freedom even the strong person could not scale the berlin wall to gain the elusive promise of independence that lie just beyond and so together we rejoice when that barrier fall

 and now i sign legislation which take a sledgehammer to another wall one which have for too many generation separate americans with disability from the freedom they could glimpse but not grasp once again we rejoice as this barrier fall for claim together we will not accept we will not excuse we will not tolerate discrimination in america

 with again great thank to the members of the united states senate leader of whom be here today and those who work so tirelessly for this legislation on both side of the aisle and to those members of the house of representatives with we here today democrats and republicans as well i salute you and on your behalf as well as the behalf of this entire country i now lift my pen to sign this americans with disabilities act and say let the shameful wall of exclusion finally come tumble down

 god bless you all

in the life of a nation we be call upon to define who we be and what we believe sometimes these choice be not easy but today as president i ask for your support in a decision i have make to stand up for what be right and condemn what be wrong all in the cause of peace

 at my direction element of the 82d airborne division as well as key unit of the united states air force be arrive today to take up defensive position in saudi arabia i take this action to assist the saudi arabian government in the defense of its homeland no one commit america 's armed forces to a dangerous mission lightly but after perhaps unparalleled international consultation and exhaust every alternative it become necessary to take this action let i tell you why

 less than a week ago in the early morning hour of august 2d iraqi armed forces without provocation or warning invade a peaceful kuwait face negligible resistance from its much small neighbor iraq 's tank storm in blitzkrieg fashion through kuwait in a few short hour with more than 100,000 troop along with tank artillery and surface to surface missile iraq now occupy kuwait this aggression come just hour after saddam hussein specifically assure numerous country in the area that there would be no invasion there be no justification whatsoever for this outrageous and brutal act of aggression

 a puppet regime impose from the outside be unacceptable the acquisition of territory by force be unacceptable no one friend or foe should doubt our desire for peace and no one should underestimate our determination to confront aggression

 four simple principle guide our policy first we seek the immediate unconditional and complete withdrawal of all iraqi force from kuwait second kuwait 's legitimate government must be restore to replace the puppet regime and third my administration as have be the case with every president from president roosevelt to president reagan be commit to the security and stability of the persian gulf and fourth i be determined to protect the life of american citizen abroad

 immediately after the iraqi invasion i order an embargo of all trade with iraq and together with many other nation announce sanction that both freeze all iraqi asset in this country and protect kuwait 's asset the stake be high iraq be already a rich and powerful country that possess the world 's second large reserve of oil and over a million man under arm it be the fourth large military in the world our country now import nearly half the oil it consume and could face a major threat to its economic independence much of the world be even more dependent upon import oil and be even more vulnerable to iraqi threat

 we succeed in the struggle for freedom in europe because we and our ally remain stalwart keep the peace in the middle east will require no less we be begin a new era this new era can be full of promise an age of freedom a time of peace for all people but if history teach we anything it be that we must resist aggression or it will destroy our freedom appeasement do not work as be the case in the 1930 's we see in saddam hussein an aggressive dictator threaten his neighbor only 14 day ago saddam hussein promise his friend he would not invade kuwait and 4 day ago he promise the world he would withdraw and twice we have see what his promise mean his promise mean nothing

 in the last few day i have speak with political leader from the middle east europe asia and the americas and i have meet with prime minister thatcher prime minister mulroney and nato secretary general woerner and all agree that iraq can not be allow to benefit from its invasion of kuwait

 we agree that this be not an american problem or a european problem or a middle east problem it be the world 's problem and that be why soon after the iraqi invasion the united nations security council without dissent condemn iraq call for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of its troop from kuwait the arab world through both the arab league and the gulf cooperation council courageously announce its opposition to iraqi aggression japan the united kingdom and france and other government around the world have impose severe sanction the soviet union and china end all arm sale to iraq

 and this past monday the united nations security council approve for the first time in 23 year mandatory sanction under chapter vii of the united nations charter these sanction now enshrine in international law have the potential to deny iraq the fruit of aggression while sharply limit its ability to either import or export anything of value especially oil

 i pledge here today that the united states will do its part to see that these sanction be effective and to induce iraq to withdraw without delay from kuwait

 but we must recognize that iraq may not stop use force to advance its ambition iraq have mass an enormous war machine on the saudi border capable of initiate hostility with little or no additional preparation give the iraqi government 's history of aggression against its own citizen as well as its neighbor to assume iraq will not attack again would be unwise and unrealistic

 and therefore after consult with king fahd i send secretary of defense dick cheney to discuss cooperative measure we could take follow those meeting the saudi government request our help and i respond to that request by order u.s. air and ground force to deploy to the kingdom of saudi arabia

 let i be clear the sovereign independence of saudi arabia be of vital interest to the united states this decision which i share with the congressional leadership grow out of the longstanding friendship and security relationship between the united states and saudi arabia u.s. force will work together with those of saudi arabia and other nation to preserve the integrity of saudi arabia and to deter further iraqi aggression through their presence as well as through training and exercise these multinational force will enhance the overall capability of saudi armed forces to defend the kingdom

 i want to be clear about what we be do and why america do not seek conflict nor do we seek to chart the destiny of other nation but america will stand by her friend the mission of our troop be wholly defensive hopefully they will not be need long they will not initiate hostility but they will defend themselves the kingdom of saudi arabia and other friend in the persian gulf

 we be work around the clock to deter iraqi aggression and to enforce u.n. sanction i be continue my conversation with world leader secretary of defense cheney have just return from valuable consultation with president mubarak of egypt and king hassan of morocco secretary of state baker have consult with his counterpart in many nation include the soviet union and today he head for europe to consult with president ozal of turkey a staunch friend of the united states and he will then consult with the nato foreign ministers

 i will ask oil produce nation to do what they can to increase production in order to minimize any impact that oil flow reduction will have on the world economy and i will explore whether we and our ally should draw down our strategic petroleum reserve conservation measure can also help americans everywhere must do their part and one more thing i be ask the oil company to do their fair share they should show restraint and not abuse today 's uncertainty to raise price

 stand up for our principle will not come easy it may take time and possibly cost a great deal but we be ask no more of anyone than of the brave young man and woman of our armed forces and their family and i ask that in the church around the country prayer be say for those who be commit to protect and defend america 's interest

 stand up for our principle be an american tradition as it have so many time before it may take time and tremendous effort but most of all it will take unity of purpose as i have witness throughout my life in both war and peace america have never waver when her purpose be drive by principle and in this august day at home and abroad i know she will do no less

 thank you and god bless the united states of america

mr. president and mr. speaker and members of the united states congress distinguished guest fellow americans thank you very much for that warm welcome we gather tonight witness to event in the persian gulf as significant as they be tragic in the early morning hour of august 2d follow negotiation and promise by iraq 's dictator saddam hussein not to use force a powerful iraqi army invade its trusting and much weak neighbor kuwait within 3 day 120,000 iraqi troop with 850 tank have pour into kuwait and move south to threaten saudi arabia it be then that i decide to act to check that aggression
 at this moment our brave servicemen and woman stand watch in that distant desert and on distant sea side by side with the force of more than 20 other nation they be some of the fine man and woman of the united states of america and they be do one terrific job these valiant americans be ready at a moment 's notice to leave their spouse and their child to serve on the front line halfway around the world they remind we who keep america strong they do in the try circumstance of the gulf the morale of our service man and woman be excellent in the face of danger they be brave they be well train and dedicate
 a soldier private first class wade merritt of knoxville tennessee now station in saudi arabia write his parent of his worry his love of family and his hope for peace but wade also write i be proud of my country and its firm stance against inhumane aggression i be proud of my army and its man i be proud to serve my country well let i just say wade america be proud of you and be grateful to every soldier sailor marine and airman serve the cause of peace in the persian gulf i also want to thank the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general powell the chiefs here tonight our commander in the persian gulf general schwartzkopf and the man and woman of the department of defense what a magnificent job you all be do and thank you very very much from a grateful people i wish i could say that their work be do but we all know it be not
 so if there ever be a time to put country before self and patriotism before party the time be now and let i thank all americans especially those here in this chamber tonight for your support for our armed force and for their mission that support will be even more important in the day to come so tonight i want to talk to you about what be at stake what we must do together to defend civilized value around the world and maintain our economic strength at home
 our objective in the persian gulf be clear our goal define and familiar iraq must withdraw from kuwait completely immediately and without condition kuwait 's legitimate government must be restore the security and stability of the persian gulf must be assure and american citizen abroad must be protect these goal be not ours alone they have be endorse by the united nations security council five time in as many week most country share our concern for principle and many have a stake in the stability of the persian gulf this be not as saddam hussein would have it the united states against iraq it be iraq against the world
 as you know i have just return from a very productive meeting with soviet president gorbachev and i be pleased that we be work together to build a new relationship in helsinki our joint statement affirm to the world our share resolve to counter iraq 's threat to peace let i quote we be unite in the belief that iraq 's aggression must not be tolerate no peaceful international order be possible if large state can devour their small neighbor clearly no long can a dictator count on east west confrontation to stymie concert united nations action against aggression a new partnership of nation have begin
 we stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment the crisis in the persian gulf as grave as it be also offer a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation out of these troubled time our fifth objective a new world order can emerge a new era free from the threat of terror strong in the pursuit of justice and more secure in the quest for peace an era in which the nation of the world east and west north and south can prosper and live in harmony a hundred generation have search for this elusive path to peace while a thousand war rage across the span of human endeavor today that new world be struggle to be bear a world quite different from the one we have know a world where the rule of law supplant the rule of the jungle a world in which nation recognize the share responsibility for freedom and justice a world where the strong respect the right of the weak this be the vision that i share with president gorbachev in helsinki he and other leader from europe the gulf and around the world understand that how we manage this crisis today could shape the future for generation to come
 the test we face be great and so be the stake this be the first assault on the new world that we seek the first test of our mettle have we not respond to this first provocation with clarity of purpose if we do not continue to demonstrate our determination it would be a signal to actual and potential despot around the world america and the world must defend common vital interest and we will america and the world must support the rule of law and we will america and the world must stand up to aggression and we will and one thing more in the pursuit of these goal america will not be intimidate
 vital issue of principle be at stake saddam hussein be literally try to wipe a country off the face of the earth we do not exaggerate nor do we exaggerate when we say saddam hussein will fail vital economic interest be at risk as well iraq itself control some 10 percent of the world 's prove oil reserve iraq plus kuwait control twice that an iraq permit to swallow kuwait would have the economic and military power as well as the arrogance to intimidate and coerce its neighbor neighbor who control the lion 's share of the world 's remain oil reserve we can not permit a resource so vital to be dominate by one so ruthless and we will not
 recent event have surely prove that there be no substitute for american leadership in the face of tyranny let no one doubt american credibility and reliability let no one doubt our staying power we will stand by our friend one way or another the leader of iraq must learn this fundamental truth from the outset act hand in hand with other we have seek to fashion the broad possible international response to iraq 's aggression the level of world cooperation and condemnation of iraq be unprecedented armed force from country span four continent be there at the request of king fahd of saudi arabia to deter and if need be to defend against attack moslem and non moslems arabs and non arabs soldier from many nation stand shoulder to shoulder resolute against saddam hussein 's ambition
 we can now point to five united nations security council resolution that condemn iraq 's aggression they call for iraq 's immediate and unconditional withdrawal the restoration of kuwait 's legitimate government and categorically reject iraq 's cynical and self serve attempt to annex kuwait finally the united nations have demand the release of all foreign national hold hostage against their will and in contravention of international law it be a mockery of human decency to call these people guest they be hostage and the whole world know it
 prime minister margaret thatcher a dependable ally say it all we do not bargain over hostage we will not stoop to the level of use human being as bargaining chip ever of course of course our heart go out to the hostage and to their family but our policy can not change and it will not change america and the world will not be blackmail by this ruthless policy
 we be now in sight of a united nations that perform as envision by its founder we owe much to the outstanding leadership of secretary general javier perez de cuellar the united nations be back up its word with action the security council have impose mandatory economic sanction on iraq design to force iraq to relinquish the spoil of its illegal conquest the security council have also take the decisive step of authorize the use of all mean necessary to ensure compliance with these sanction together with our friend and ally ship of the united states navy be today patrol mideast water they have already intercept more than 700 ship to enforce the sanction three regional leader i speak with just yesterday tell i that these sanction be work iraq be feel the heat we continue to hope that iraq 's leader will recalculate just what their aggression have cost they they be cut off from world trade unable to sell their oil and only a tiny fraction of good get through
 the communique with president gorbachev make mention of what happen when the embargo be so effective that child of iraq literally need milk or the sick truly need medicine then under strict international supervision that guarantee the proper destination then food will be permit
 at home the material cost of our leadership can be steep that be why secretary of state baker and treasury secretary brady have meet with many world leader to underscore that the burden of this collective effort must be share we be prepared to do our share and more to help carry that load we insist that other do their share as well
 the response of most of our friend and ally have be good to help defray cost the leader of saudi arabia kuwait and the uae the united arab emirates have pledge to provide our deploy troop with all the food and fuel they need generous assistance will also be provide to stalwart front line nation such as turkey and egypt i be also hearten to report that this international response extend to the needy victim of this conflict those refugee for our part we have contribute $ 28 million for relief effort this be but a portion of what be need i commend in particular saudi arabia japan and several european nation who have join we in this purely humanitarian effort
 there be an energy relate cost to be bear as well oil produce nation be already replace lose iraqi and kuwaiti output more than half of what be lose have be make up and we be get superb cooperation if producer include the united states continue step to expand oil and gas production we can stabilize price and guarantee against hardship additionally we and several of our ally always have the option to extract oil from our strategic petroleum reserve if condition warrant as i have point out before conservation effort be essential to keep our energy need as low as possible and we must then take advantage of our energy source across the board coal natural gas hydro and nuclear our failure to do these thing have make we more dependent on foreign oil than ever before finally let no one even contemplate profiteer from this crisis we will not have it
 i can not predict just how long it will take to convince iraq to withdraw from kuwait sanction will take time to have their full intended effect we will continue to review all option with our ally but let it be clear we will not let this aggression stand
 our interest our involvement in the gulf be not transitory it predate saddam hussein 's aggression and will survive it long after all our troop come home and we all hope it be soon very soon there will be a lasting role for the united states in assist the nation of the persian gulf our role then to deter future aggression our role be to help our friend in their own self defense and something else to curb the proliferation of chemical biological ballistic missile and above all nuclear technology
 let i also make clear that the united states have no quarrel with the iraqi people our quarrel be with iraq 's dictator and with his aggression iraq will not be permit to annex kuwait that be not a threat that be not a boast that be just the way it be go to be
 our ability to function effectively as a great power abroad depend on how we conduct ourselves at home our economy our armed forces our energy dependence and our cohesion all determine whether we can help our friend and stand up to our foe for america to lead america must remain strong and vital our world leadership and domestic strength be mutual and reinforcing a woven piece strongly bind as old glory to revitalize our leadership our leadership capacity we must address our budget deficit not after election day or next year but now
 high oil price slow our growth and high defense cost would only make our fiscal deficit problem worse that deficit be already great than it should have be a project $ 232 billion for the come year it must it will be reduce
 to my friend in congress together we must act this very month before the next fiscal year begin on october 1st to get america 's economic house in order the gulf situation help we realize we be more economically vulnerable than we ever should be americans must never again enter any crisis economic or military with an excessive dependence on foreign oil and an excessive burden of federal debt
 most americans be sick and tired of endless battle in the congress and between the branch over budget matter it be high time we pull together and get the job do right it be up to we to straighten this out this job have four basic part first the congress should this month within a budget agreement enact growth orient tax measure to help avoid recession in the short term and to increase saving investment productivity and competitiveness for the long term these measure include extend incentive for research and experimentation expand the use of ira 's for new homeowner establish tax defer family saving account create incentive for the creation of enterprise zone and initiative to encourage more domestic drilling and yes reduce the tax rate on capital gain
 and second the congress should this month enact a prudent multiyear defense program one that reflect not only the improvement in east west relation but our broad responsibility to deal with the continue risk of outlaw action and regional conflict even with our obligation in the gulf a sound defense budget can have some reduction in real term and we be prepared to accept that but to go beyond such level where cut defense would threaten our vital margin of safety be something i will never accept the world be still dangerous and surely that be now clear stability be not secure american interest be far reach interdependence have increase the consequence of regional instability can be global this be no time to risk america 's capacity to protect her vital interest
 and third the congress should this month enact measure to increase domestic energy production and energy conservation in order to reduce dependence on foreign oil these measure should include my proposal to increase incentive for domestic oil and gas exploration fuel switching and to accelerate the development of the alaskan energy resource without damage to wildlife as you know when the oil embargo be impose in the early 1970 's the united states import almost 6 million barrel of oil a day this year before the iraqi invasion u.s. import have rise to nearly 8 million barrel per day and we have move in the wrong direction and now we must act to correct that trend
 and fourth the congress should this month enact a 5 year program to reduce the project debt and deficit by $ 500 billion that be by half a trillion dollar and if with the congress we can develop a satisfactory program by the end of the month we can avoid the ax of sequester deep across the board cut that would threaten our military capacity and risk substantial domestic disruption i want to be able to tell the american people that we have truly solve the deficit problem and for i to do that a budget agreement must meet these test it must include the measure i have recommend to increase economic growth and reduce dependence on foreign oil it must be fair all should contribute but the burden should not be excessive for any one group of program or people it must address the growth of government 's hide liability it must reform the budget process and far it must be real
 i urge congress to provide a comprehensive 5 year deficit reduction program to i as a complete legislative package with measure to assure that it can be fully enforce america be tired of phony deficit reduction or promise now save later plan it be time for a program that be credible and real and finally to the extent that the deficit reduction program include new revenue measure it must avoid any measure that would threaten economic growth or turn we back toward the day of punish income tax rate that be one path we should not head down again
 i have be pleased with recent progress although it have not always seem so smooth but now it be time to produce i hope we can work out a responsible plan but with or without agreement from the budget summit i ask both houses of the congress to allow a straight up or down vote on a complete $ 500 billion deficit reduction package not later than september 28 if the congress can not get i a budget then americans will have to face a tough mandate sequester i be hopeful in fact i be confident that the congress will do what it should and i can assure you that we in the executive branch will do our part
 in the final analysis our ability to meet our responsibility abroad depend upon political will and consensus at home this be never easy in democracy for we govern only with the consent of the govern and although free people in a free society be bind to have their difference americans traditionally come together in time of adversity and challenge
 once again americans have step forward to share a tearful goodbye with their family before leave for a strange and distant shore at this very moment they serve together with arabs europeans asians and africans in defense of principle and the dream of a new world order that be why they sweat and toil in the sand and the heat and the sun if they can come together under such adversity if old adversary like the soviet union and the united states can work in common cause then surely we who be so fortunate to be in this great chamber democrats republicans liberal conservative can come together to fulfill our responsibility here
 thank you good night and god bless the united states of america

mr. president thank you very much mr. secretary general distinguished delegate to the united nations it be really a great privilege to greet you today as we begin what mark a new and historic session of the general assembly my congratulation to the honorable guido de marco on your election sir as president of the general assembly and on a personal note i want to say that having witness the unprecedented unity and cooperation of the past 2 month that i have never be prouder to have once serve within your rank and never be prouder that the united states be the host country for the united nations

 forty five year ago while the fire of an epic war still rage across two ocean and two continent a small group of man and woman begin a search for hope amid the ruin and they gather in san francisco step back from the haze and horror to try to shape a new structure that might support an ancient dream intensely idealistic and yet temper by war they seek to build a new kind of bridge a bridge between nation a bridge that might help carry humankind from its dark hour to its bright day

 the founding of the united nations embody our deep hope for a peaceful world and during the past year we have come close than ever before to realize those hope we have see a century sunder by barbed threat and barbed wire give way to a new era of peace and competition and freedom

 the revolution of 89 sweep the world almost with a life of its own carry by a new breeze of freedom it transform the political climate from central europe to central america and touch almost every corner of the globe that breeze have be sustain by a now almost universal recognition of a simple fundamental truth the human spirit can not be lock up forever the truth be people everywhere be motivate in much the same way and people everywhere want much the same thing the chance to live a life of purpose the chance to choose a life in which they and their child can learn and grow healthy worship freely and prosper through the work of their hand and their heart and their mind we be not talk about the power of nation but the power of individual the power to choose the power to risk the power to succeed

 this be a new and different world not since 1945 have we see the real possibility of use the united nations as it be design as a center for international collective security

 the change in the soviet union have be critical to the emergence of a strong united nations the u.s.-soviet relationship be finally beyond containment and confrontation and now we seek to fulfill the promise of mutually share understanding the long twilight struggle that for 45 year have divide europe our two nation and much of the world have come to an end

 much have change over the last 2 year the soviet union have take many dramatic and important step to participate fully in the community of nation and when the soviet union agree with so many of we here in the united nations to condemn the aggression of iraq there could be no doubt no doubt then that we have indeed put four decade of history behind we

 we be hopeful that the machinery of the united nations will no long be freeze by the division that plague we during the cold war that at last long last we can build new bridge and tear down old wall that at long last we will be able to build a new world base on an event for which we have all hope an end to the cold war

 two day from now the world will be watch when the cold war be formally bury in berlin and in this time of testing a fundamental question must be ask a question not for any one nation but for the united nations and the question be this can we work together in a new partnership of nation can the collective strength of the world community express by the united nations unite to deter and defeat aggression because the cold war 's battle of idea be not the last epic battle of this century

 two month ago in the wane week of one of history 's most hopeful summer the vast still beauty of the peaceful kuwaiti desert be foul by the stench of diesel and the roar of steel tank once again the sound of distant thunder echo across a cloudless sky and once again the world awake to face the gun of august

 but this time the world be ready the united nations security council 's resolute response to iraq 's unprovoked aggression have be without precedent since the invasion on august 2d the council have pass eight major resolution set the term for a solution to the crisis

 the iraqi regime have yet to face the fact but as i say last month the annexation of kuwait will not be permit to stand and this be not simply the view of the united states it be the view of every kuwaiti the arab league the united nations iraq 's leader should listen it be iraq against the world

 let i take this opportunity to make the policy of my government clear the united states support the use of sanction to compel iraq 's leader to withdraw immediately and without condition from kuwait we also support the provision of medicine and food for humanitarian purpose so long as distribution can be properly monitor our quarrel be not with the people of iraq we do not wish for they to suffer the world 's quarrel be with the dictator who order that invasion

 along with other we have dispatch military force to the region to enforce sanction to deter and if need be defend against further aggression and we seek no advantage for ourselves nor do we seek to maintain our military force in saudi arabia for 1 day long than be necessary u.s. force be send at the request of the saudi government and the american people and this president want every single american soldier bring home as soon as this mission be complete

 let i also emphasize that all of we here at the u.n. hope that military force will never be use we seek a peaceful outcome a diplomatic outcome and one more thing in the aftermath of iraq 's unconditional departure from kuwait i truly believe there may be opportunity for iraq and kuwait to settle their difference permanently for the state of the gulf themselves to build new arrangement for stability and for all the state and the people of the region to settle the conflict that divide the arabs from israel

 but the world 's key task now first and always must be to demonstrate that aggression will not be tolerate or reward through the u.n. security council iraq have be fairly judge by a jury of its peer the very nation of the earth today the regime stand isolated and out of step with the time separate from the civilized world not by space but by century

 iraq 's unprovoked aggression be a throwback to another era a dark relic from a dark time it have plunder kuwait it have terrorize innocent civilian it have hold even diplomat hostage iraq and its leader must be hold liable for these crime of abuse and destruction but this outrageous disregard for basic human right do not come as a total surprise thousand of iraqis have be execute on political and religious ground and even more through a genocidal poison gas war wage against iraq 's own kurdish villager

 as a world community we must act not only to deter the use of inhumane weapon like mustard and nerve gas but to eliminate the weapon entirely and that be why 1 year ago i come to the general assembly with new proposal to banish these terrible weapon from the face of the earth i promise that the united states would destroy over 98 percent of its stockpile in the first 8 year of a chemical weapon ban treaty and 100 percent all of they in 10 year if all nation with chemical capability chemical weapon sign the treaty we have stand by those promise in june the united states and the soviet union sign a landmark agreement to halt production and to destroy the vast majority of our stockpile today u.s. chemical weapon be be destroy

 but time be run out this be not merely a bilateral concern the gulf crisis prove how important it be to act together and to act now to conclude an absolute worldwide ban on these weapon we must also redouble our effort to stem the spread of nuclear weapon biological weapon and the ballistic missile that can rain destruction upon distant people

 the united nations can help bring about a new day a day when these kind of terrible weapon and the terrible despot who would use they be both a thing of the past it be in our hand to leave these dark machine behind in the dark ages where they belong and to press forward to cap a historic movement towards a new world order and a long era of peace

 we have a vision of a new partnership of nation that transcend the cold war a partnership base on consultation cooperation and collective action especially through international and regional organization a partnership unite by principle and the rule of law and support by an equitable sharing of both cost and commitment a partnership whose goal be to increase democracy increase prosperity increase the peace and reduce arm

 and as we look to the future the calendar offer up a convenient milestone a signpost by which to measure our progress as a community of nation the year 2000 mark a turning point begin not only the turn of the decade not only the turn of the century but also the turn of the millennium and 10 year from now as the 55th session of the general assembly begin you will again find many of we in this hall hair a bit more gray perhaps maybe a little less spring in our walk but you will not find we with any less hope or idealism or any less confidence in the ultimate triumph of mankind

 i see a world of open border open trade and most importantly open mind a world that celebrate the common heritage that belong to all the world 's people take pride not just in hometown or homeland but in humanity itself i see a world touch by a spirit like that of the olympics base not on competition that be drive by fear but seek out of joy and exhilaration and a true quest for excellence and i see a world where democracy continue to win new friend and convert old foe and where the americas north central and south can provide a model for the future of all humankind the world 's first completely democratic hemisphere and i see a world build on the emerge new model of european unity not just europe but the whole world whole and free

 this be precisely why the present aggression in the gulf be a menace not only to one region 's security but to the entire world 's vision of our future it threaten to turn the dream of a new international order into a grim nightmare of anarchy in which the law of the jungle supplant the law of nation and that be why the united nations react with such historic unity and resolve and that be why this challenge be a test that we can not afford to fail i be confident we will prevail success too will have lasting consequence reinforce civilized standard of international conduct set a new precedent in international cooperation brighten the prospect for our vision of the future

 there be 10 more year until this century be out 10 more year to put the struggle of the 20th century permanently behind we 10 more year to help launch a new partnership of nation and throughout those 10 year and begin now the united nations have a new and vital role in building towards that partnership last year 's general assembly show how we can make great progress toward a more pragmatic and successful united nations and for the first time the u.n. security council be begin to work as it be design to work and now be the time to set aside old and counterproductive debate and procedure and controversy and resolution it be time to replace polemic attack with pragmatic action

 and we have show that the u.n. can count on the collective strength of the international community we have show that the u.n. can rise to the challenge of aggression just as its founder hope that it would and now be the time of testing and we must also show that the united nations be the place to build international support and consensus for meet the other challenge we face

 the world remain a dangerous place and our security and well being often depend in part on event occur far away we need serious international cooperative effort to make headway on the threat to the environment on terrorism on manage the debt burden on fight the scourge of international drug trafficking and on refugee and peacekeeping effort around the world

 but the world also remain a hopeful place call for democracy and human right be be reborn everywhere and these call be an expression of support for the value enshrine in the united nations charter they encourage our hope for a more stable more peaceful more prosperous world

 free election be the foundation of democratic government and can produce dramatic success as we have see in namibia and nicaragua and the time have come to structure the u.n. role in such effort more formally and so today i propose that the u.n. establish a special coordinator for electoral assistance to be assist by a u.n. electoral commission comprise of distinguished expert from around the world

 as with free election we also believe that universal u.n. membership for all state be central to the future of this organization and to this new partnership we have discuss in support of this principle and in conjunction with u.n. effort to reduce regional tension the united states fully support u.n. membership for the republic of korea we do so without prejudice to the ultimate objective of reunification of the korean peninsula and without opposition to simultaneous membership for the democratic people 's republic of korea

 build on these and other initiative we must join together in a new compact all of we to bring the united nations into the 21st century and i call today for a major long term effort to do so we should build on the success the admirable success of our distinguished secretary general my longtime friend and your my longtime colleague i might also say javier perez de cuellar we should strive for great effectiveness and efficiency of the united nations

 the united states be committed to play its part help to maintain global security promote democracy and prosperity and my administration be fully commit to support the united nations and to pay what we be oblige to pay by our commitment to the charter international peace and security and international freedom and prosperity require no less

 the world must know and understand from this hour from this day from this hall we step forth with a new sense of purpose a new sense of possibility we stand together prepare to swim upstream to march uphill to tackle the tough challenge as they come not only as the united nations but as the nation of the world united

 and so let it be say of the final decade of the 20th century this be a time when humankind come into its own when we emerge from the grit and the smoke of the industrial age to bring about a revolution of the spirit and the mind and begin a journey into a new day a new age and a new partnership of nation

 the u.n. be now fulfil its promise as the world 's parliament of peace and i congratulate you i support you and i wish you godspeed in the challenge ahead

 thank you very very much

tonight i want to talk to you about a problem that have linger and dog and vex this country for far too long the federal budget deficit thomas paine say many year ago these be the time that try man 's soul as we speak our nation be stand together against saddam hussein 's aggression but here at home there be another threat a cancer gnaw away at our nation 's health that cancer be the budget deficit
 year after year it mortgage the future of our child no family no nation can continue to do business the way the federal government have be operate and survive when you get a bill that bill must be pay and when you write a check you be suppose to have money in the bank but if you do not obey these simple rule of common sense there be a price to pay
 but for too long the nation 's business in washington have be conduct as if these basic rule do not apply well these rule do apply and if we fail to act next year alone we will face a federal budget deficit of more than $ 300 billion a deficit that could weaken our economy far and cost we thousand of precious job if what go up must come down then the way down could be very hard
 but it do not have to be that way we can do something in fact we have start to do something but we must act this week when congress will hold the first of two crucial up or down vote these vote will be on a deficit reduction agreement work out between the administration and the bipartisan leader of congress this budget agreement be the result of 8 month of blood sweat and fear fear of the economic chaos that would follow if we fail to reduce the deficit
 of course i can not claim it be the good deficit reduction plan possible it be not any one of we alone might have write a well plan but it be the good agreement that can be legislate now it be the big deficit reduction agreement ever half a trillion dollar it be the tough deficit reduction package ever with new enforcement rule to make sure that what we fix now stays fix and it have the large spending saving ever more than $ 300 billion for the first time a republican president and leader of a democratic congress have agree to real cut that will be enforce by law not promise no smoke no mirror no magic act but real and lasting spending cut
 this agreement will also raise revenue i be not and i know you be not a fan of tax increase but if there have to be tax measure they should allow the economy to grow they should not turn we back to high income tax rate and they should be fair everyone who can should contribute something and no one should have to contribute beyond their fair share our bipartisan agreement meet these test and through specific new incentive it will help create more job
 it be a little know fact but america 's good job creator and great innovator tend to be our small company so our budget plan will give small and medium size company a need shot in the arm just as important i be convinced that this agreement will help lower interest rate and low interest rate mean saving for consumer low mortgage payment for new homeowner and more investment to produce more job and that be what this agreement will do
 now let i tell you what this agreement will not do it will not raise income tax rate personal or corporate it will not mess with social security in any way it will not put america 's national security at risk and most of all it will not let our economy slip out of control
 clearly each and every one of we can find fault with something in this agreement in fact that be a burden that any truly fair solution must carry any workable solution must be judge as a whole not piece by piece those who dislike one part or another may pick our agreement apart but if they do believe i the political reality be no one can put a well one back together again everyone will bear a small burden but if we succeed every american will have a large burden lift if we fail to enact this agreement our economy will falter market may tumble and recession will follow
 in just a moment the democratic majority leader senator mitchell will offer what be know as the democratic response often a rebuttal but not tonight tonight the democratic and republican leadership and i all speak with one voice in support of this agreement tonight we ask you to help we move this agreement forward the congressional leadership and i both have a job to do in get it enact and tonight i ask for your help
 first i ask you to understand how important and for some how difficult this vote be for your congressman and senator many worry about your reaction to one part or another but i know you know the importance of the whole and so second i ask you to take this initiative tell your congressman and senator you support this deficit reduction agreement if they be republicans urge they to stand with the president urge they to do what the bipartisan leadership have do come together in the spirit of compromise to solve this national problem if they be democrats urge they to stand with their congressional leader ask they to fight for the future of your kid by support this budget agreement
 now be the time for you the american people to have a real impact your senators and congressmen need to know that you want this deficit bring down that the time for politic and posturing be over and the time to come together be now
 this deficit reduction agreement be tough and so be the time the agreement be fair and so be the american spirit the agreement be bipartisan and so be the vote the agreement be real and so be this crisis
 this be the first time in my presidency that i have make an appeal like this to you the american people with your help we can at last put this budget crisis behind we and face the other challenge that lie ahead if we do the long term result will be a healthy nation and something more we will have once again put ourselves on the path of economic growth and we will have demonstrate that no challenge be great than the determination of the american people
 thank you god bless you and good night

just 2 hour ago ally air force begin an attack on military target in iraq and kuwait these attack continue as i speak ground force be not engage
 this conflict start august 2d when the dictator of iraq invade a small and helpless neighbor kuwait a member of the arab league and a member of the united nations be crush its people brutalize five month ago saddam hussein start this cruel war against kuwait tonight the battle have be join
 this military action take in accord with united nations resolution and with the consent of the united states congress follow month of constant and virtually endless diplomatic activity on the part of the united nations the united states and many many other country arab leader seek what became know as an arab solution only to conclude that saddam hussein be unwilling to leave kuwait other travel to baghdad in a variety of effort to restore peace and justice our secretary of state james baker hold an historic meeting in geneva only to be totally rebuff this past weekend in a last ditch effort the secretary general of the united nations go to the middle east with peace in his heart his second such mission and he come back from baghdad with no progress at all in get saddam hussein to withdraw from kuwait
 now the 28 country with force in the gulf area have exhaust all reasonable effort to reach a peaceful resolution have no choice but to drive saddam from kuwait by force we will not fail
 as i report to you air attack be underway against military target in iraq we be determined to knock out saddam hussein 's nuclear bomb potential we will also destroy his chemical weapon facility much of saddam 's artillery and tank will be destroy our operation be design to well protect the life of all the coalition force by target saddam 's vast military arsenal initial report from general schwarzkopf be that our operation be proceed accord to plan
 our objective be clear saddam hussein 's force will leave kuwait the legitimate government of kuwait will be restore to its rightful place and kuwait will once again be free iraq will eventually comply with all relevant united nations resolution and then when peace be restore it be our hope that iraq will live as a peaceful and cooperative member of the family of nation thus enhance the security and stability of the gulf
 some may ask why act now why not wait the answer be clear the world could wait no long sanction though have some effect show no sign of accomplish their objective sanction be try for well over 5 month and we and our ally conclude that sanction alone would not force saddam from kuwait
 while the world wait saddam hussein systematically rape pillage and plunder a tiny nation no threat to his own he subject the people of kuwait to unspeakable atrocity and among those maim and murder innocent child
 while the world wait saddam seek to add to the chemical weapon arsenal he now possess an infinitely more dangerous weapon of mass destruction a nuclear weapon and while the world wait while the world talk peace and withdrawal saddam hussein dig in and move massive force into kuwait
 while the world wait while saddam stall more damage be be do to the fragile economy of the third world emerge democracy of eastern europe to the entire world include to our own economy
 the united states together with the united nations exhaust every mean at our disposal to bring this crisis to a peaceful end however saddam clearly feel that by stall and threaten and defy the united nations he could weaken the force array against he
 while the world wait saddam hussein meet every overture of peace with open contempt while the world pray for peace saddam prepare for war
 i have hope that when the united states congress in historic debate take its resolute action saddam would realize he could not prevail and would move out of kuwait in accord with the united nation resolution he do not do that instead he remain intransigent certain that time be on his side
 saddam be warn over and over again to comply with the will of the united nations leave kuwait or be drive out saddam have arrogantly reject all warning instead he try to make this a dispute between iraq and the united states of america
 well he fail tonight 28 nation country from 5 continent europe and asia africa and the arab league have force in the gulf area stand shoulder to shoulder against saddam hussein these country have hope the use of force could be avoid regrettably we now believe that only force will make he leave
 prior to order our force into battle i instruct our military commander to take every necessary step to prevail as quickly as possible and with the great degree of protection possible for american and allied service man and woman i have tell the american people before that this will not be another vietnam and i repeat this here tonight our troop will have the good possible support in the entire world and they will not be ask to fight with one hand tie behind their back i be hopeful that this fighting will not go on for long and that casualty will be hold to an absolute minimum
 this be an historic moment we have in this past year make great progress in end the long era of conflict and cold war we have before we the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generation a new world order a world where the rule of law not the law of the jungle govern the conduct of nation when we be successful and we will be we have a real chance at this new world order an order in which a credible united nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise and vision of the u.n. 's founder
 we have no argument with the people of iraq indeed for the innocent catch in this conflict i pray for their safety our goal be not the conquest of iraq it be the liberation of kuwait it be my hope that somehow the iraqi people can even now convince their dictator that he must lay down his arm leave kuwait and let iraq itself rejoin the family of peace love nation
 thomas paine write many year ago these be the time that try man 's soul those well know word be so very true today but even as plane of the multinational force attack iraq i prefer to think of peace not war i be convinced not only that we will prevail but that out of the horror of combat will come the recognition that no nation can stand against a world united no nation will be permit to brutally assault its neighbor
 no president can easily commit our son and daughter to war they be the nation 's fine ours be an all volunteer force magnificently train highly motivated the troop know why they be there and listen to what they say for they have say it well than any president or prime minister ever could
 listen to hollywood huddleston marine lance corporal he say let us free these people so we can go home and be free again and he be right the terrible crime and torture commit by saddam 's henchman against the innocent people of kuwait be an affront to mankind and a challenge to the freedom of all
 listen to one of our great officer out there marine lieutenant general walter boomer he say there be thing worth fight for a world in which brutality and lawlessness be allow to go unchecked be not the kind of world we be go to want to live in
 listen to master sergeant j.p. kendall of the 82d airborne we be here for more than just the price of a gallon of gas what we be do be go to chart the future of the world for the next 100 year it be well to deal with this guy now than 5 year from now
 and finally we should all sit up and listen to jackie jones an army lieutenant when she say if we let he get away with this who know what be go to be next
 i have call upon hollywood and walter and j.p. and jackie and all their courageous comrade in arm to do what must be do tonight america and the world be deeply grateful to they and to their family and let i say to everyone listen or watch tonight when the troop we have send in finish their work i be determined to bring they home as soon as possible

 we will watch carefully as the situation develop and we will maintain our contact with the soviet leadership to encourage continue commitment to democratization and reform if it be possible i want to continue to build a lasting basis for u.s.-soviet cooperation for a more peaceful future for all mankind

 the triumph of democratic idea in eastern europe and latin america and the continue struggle for freedom elsewhere all around the world all confirm the wisdom of our nation 's founder tonight we work to achieve another victory a victory over tyranny and savage aggression

 we in this union enter the last decade of the 20th century thankful for our blessing steadfast in our purpose aware of our difficulty and responsive to our duty at home and around the world for two century america have serve the world as an inspiring example of freedom and democracy for generation america have lead the struggle to preserve and extend the blessing of liberty and today in a rapidly change world american leadership be indispensable american know that leadership bring burden and sacrifice but we also know why the hope of humanity turn to we we be americans we have a unique responsibility to do the hard work of freedom and when we do freedom work

 the conviction and courage we see in the persian gulf today be simply the american character in action the indomitable spirit that be contribute to this victory for world peace and justice be the same spirit that give we the power and the potential to meet our tough challenge at home we be resolute and resourceful if we can selflessly confront the evil for the sake of good in a land so far away then surely we can make this land all that it should be if anyone tell you that america 's good day be behind she they be look the wrong way

 tonight i come before this house and the american people with an appeal for renewal this be not merely a call for new government initiative it be a call for new initiative in government in our community and from every american to prepare for the next american century

 america have always lead by example so who among we will set the example which of our citizen will lead we in this next american century everyone who step forward today to get one addict off drug to convince one troubled teenager not to give up on life to comfort one aids patient to help one hungry child

 we have within our reach the promise of a renew america we can find meaning and reward by serve some high purpose than ourselves a shine purpose the illumination of a thousand points of light and it be express by all who know the irresistible force of a child 's hand of a friend who stand by you and stay there a volunteer 's generous gesture an idea that be simply right

 the problem before we may be different but the key to solve they remain the same it be the individual the individual who step forward and the state of our union be the union of each of we one to the other the sum of our friendship marriage family and community

 we all have something to give so if you know how to read find someone who can not if you have get a hammer find a nail if you be not hungry not lonely not in trouble seek out someone who be join the community of conscience do the hard work of freedom and that will define the state of our union

 since the birth of our nation we the people have be the source of our strength what government can do alone be limited but the potential of the american people know no limit

 we be a nation of rock solid realism and clear eyed idealism we be americans we be the nation that believe in the future we be the nation that can shape the future and we have begin to do just that by strengthen the power and choice of individual and family

 together these last two year we have put dollar for child care directly in the hand of parent instead of bureaucracy unshackle the potential of americans with disability apply the creativity of the marketplace in the service of the environment for clean air and make home ownership possible for more americans

 the strength of a democracy be not in bureaucracy it be in the people and their community in everything we do let we unleash the potential of our most precious resource our citizen our citizen themselves we must return to family community county city states and institution of every kind the power to chart their own destiny and the freedom and opportunity provide by strong economic growth and that be what america be all about

 i know that tonight in some region of our country people be in genuine economic distress and i hear they early this month kathy blackwell of massachusetts write i about what can happen when the economy slow down say my heart be ache and i think that you should know your people out here be hurt badly

 i understand and i be not unrealistic about the future but there be reason to be optimistic about our economy first we do not have to fight double digit inflation second most industry will not have to make big cut in production because they do not have big inventory pile up and third our export be run solid and strong in fact american business be export at a record rate

 so let us put these time in perspective together since 1981 we have create almost 20 million job cut inflation in half and cut interest rate in half and yes the large peacetime economic expansion in history have be temporarily interrupt but our economy be still over twice as large as our close competitor

 we will get this recession behind we and return to growth soon we will get on our way to a new record of expansion and achieve the competitive strength that will carry we into the next american century we should focus our effort today on encourage economic growth invest in the future and give power and opportunity to the individual

 we must begin with control of federal spending that be why i be submit a budget that hold the growth in spending to less than the rate of inflation and that be why amid all the sound and fury of last year 's budget debate we put into law new enforceable spending cap so that future spending debate will mean a battle of idea not a bidding war

 though controversial the budget agreement finally put the federal government on a pay as you go plan and cut the growth of debt by nearly $ 500 billion and that free fund for save and job create investment

 now let us do more my budget again include tax free family saving account penalty free withdrawal from ira for first time home buyer and to increase job and growth a reduce tax for long term capital gain

 i know there be difference among us—[laughter]—about the impact and the effect of a capital gain incentive so tonight i be ask the congressional leader and the federal reserve to cooperate with we in a study lead by chairman alan greenspan to sort out our technical difference so that we can avoid a return to unproductive partisan bickering

 but just as our effort will bring economic growth now and in the future they must also be match by long term investment for the next american century that require a forward look plan of action and that be exactly what we will be send to the congress we have prepare a detailed series of proposal that include a budget that promote investment in america 's future in child education infrastructure space and high technology legislation to achieve excellence in education build on the partnership forge with the 50 governors at the education summit enable parent to choose their child 's school and help to make america number one in math and science a blueprint for a new national highway system a critical investment in our transportation infrastructure a research and development agenda that include record level of federal investment and a permanent tax credit to strengthen private r&amp;d and to create job a comprehensive national energy strategy that call for energy conservation and efficiency increase development and great use of alternative fuel a banking reform plan to bring america 's financial system into the 21st century so that our bank remain safe and secure and can continue to make job create loan for our factory our business and home buyer

 you know i do think there have be too much pessimism sound bank should be make sound loan now and interest rate should be low now

 in addition to these proposal we must recognize that our economic strength depend on be competitive in world market we must continue to expand american export a successful uruguay round of world trade negotiation will create more real job and more real growth for all nation you and i know that if the play field be level america 's worker and farmer can out work out produce anyone anytime anywhere

 and with a mexican free trade agreement and our enterprise for the americas initiative we can help our partner strengthen their economy and move toward a free trade zone throughout this entire hemisphere

 the budget also include a plan of action right here at home to put more power and opportunity in the hand of the individual and that mean new incentive to create job in our inner city by encourage investment through enterprise zone it also mean tenant control and ownership of public housing freedom and the power to choose should not be the privilege of wealth they be the birthright of every american

 civil right be also crucial to protect equal opportunity every one of we have a responsibility to speak out against racism bigotry and hate we will continue our vigorous enforcement of exist statute and i will once again press the congress to strengthen the law against employment discrimination without resort to the use of unfair preference

 we be determined to protect another fundamental civil right freedom from crime and the fear that stalk our city the attorney general will soon convene a crime summit of our nation 's law enforcement official and to help we support they we need tough crime control legislation and we need it now

 and as we fight crime we will fully implement our national strategy for combat drug abuse recent datum show that we be make progress but much remain to be do we will not rest until the day of the dealer be over forever

 good health care be every american 's right and every american 's responsibility and so we be propose an aggressive program of new prevention initiative for infant for child for adult and for the elderly to promote a healthy america and to help keep cost from spiral

 it be time to give people more choice in government by revive the ideal of the citizen politician who come not to stay but to serve and one of the reason that there be so much support across this country for term limitation be that the american people be increasingly concerned about big money influence in politic so we must look beyond the next election to the next generation and the time have come to put the national interest above the special interest and to totally eliminate political action committee and that would truly put more competition in election and more power in the hand of individual

 and where power can not be put directly in the hand of the individual it should be move close to the people away from washington the federal government too often treat government program as if they be of washington by washington and for washington once establish federal program seem to become immortal it be time for a more dynamic program life cycle some program should increase some should decrease some should be terminate and some should be consolidate and turn over to the state

 my budget include a list of program for potential turnover total more than $ 20 billion work with congress and the governors i propose we select at least $ 15 billion in such program and turn they over to the state in a single consolidated grant fully fund for flexible management by the state

 the value the value of this turnover approach be straightforward it allow the federal government to reduce overhead it allow state to manage more flexibly and more efficiently it move power and decisionmake close to the people and it reinforce a theme of this administration appreciation and encouragement of the innovative power of state as laboratory

 this nation be found by leader who understand that power belong in the hand of people and they plan for the future and so must we here and all around the world

 as americans we know that there be time when we must step forward and accept our responsibility to lead the world away from the dark chaos of dictator toward the bright promise of a well day almost 50 year ago we begin a long struggle against aggressive totalitarianism now we face another defining hour for america and the world

 there be no one more devoted more committed to the hard work of freedom than every soldier and sailor every marine airman and coastguardsman every man and woman now serve in the persian gulf oh how they deserve—[applause]—and what a fitting tribute to they

 you see what a wonderful fitting tribute to they each of they have volunteer volunteer to provide for this nation 's defense and now they bravely struggle to earn for america for the world and for future generation a just and last peace our commitment to they must be equal to their commitment to their country they be truly america 's fine

 the war in the gulf be not a war we want we work hard to avoid war for more than five month we along with the arab league the european community the united nations try every diplomatic avenue u.n. secretary general perez de cuellar president gorbachev mitterrand ozal mubarak and bendjedid kings fahd and hassan prime ministers major and andreotti just to name a few all work for a solution but time and again saddam hussein flatly reject the path of diplomacy and peace

 the world well know how this conflict begin and when it begin on august 2nd when saddam invade and sack a small defenseless neighbor and i be certain of how it will end so that peace can prevail we will prevail applause thank you

 tonight i be pleased to report that we be on course iraq 's capacity to sustain war be be destroy our investment our training our planning all be pay off time will not be saddam 's salvation

 our purpose in the persian gulf remain constant to drive iraq out of kuwait to restore kuwait 's legitimate government and to ensure the stability and security of this critical region

 let i make clear what i mean by the region 's stability and security we do not seek the destruction of iraq its culture or its people rather we seek an iraq that use its great resource not to destroy not to serve the ambition of a tyrant but to build a well life for itself and its neighbor we seek a persian gulf where conflict be no long the rule where the strong be neither tempt nor able to intimidate the weak

 most americans know instinctively why we be in the gulf they know we have to stop saddam now not later they know that this brutal dictator will do anything will use any weapon will commit any outrage no matter how many innocent suffer

 they know we must make sure that control of the world 's oil resource do not fall into his hand only to finance further aggression they know that we need to build a new endure peace base not on arm race and confrontation but on share principle and the rule of law

 and we all realize that our responsibility to be the catalyst for peace in the region do not end with the successful conclusion of this war

 democracy bring the undeniable value of thoughtful dissent and we have hear some dissent voice here at home some a handful reckless most responsible but the fact that all voice have the right to speak out be one of the reason we have be unite in purpose and principle for 200 year

 our progress in this great struggle be the result of year of vigilance and a steadfast commitment to a strong defense now with remarkable technological advance like the patriot missile we can defend against ballistic missile attack aim at innocent civilian

 look forward i have direct that the sdi program be refocus on provide protection from limited ballistic missile strike whatever their source let we pursue an sdi program that can deal with any future threat to the united states to our force overseas and to our friend and ally

 the quality of american technology thank to the american worker have enable we to successfully deal with difficult military condition and help minimize precious loss of life we have give our man and woman the very good and they deserve it

 we all have a special place in our heart for the family of our man and woman serve in the gulf they be represent here tonight by mrs. norman schwarzkopf we be all very grateful to general schwarzkopf and to all those serve with he and i might also recognize one who come with mrs. schwarzkopf alma powell the wife of the distinguished chairman of the joint chiefs and to the family let i say our force in the gulf will not stay there one day long than be necessary to complete their mission

 the courage and success of the raf pilot of the kuwaiti saudi french the canadians the italians the pilot of qatar and bahrain all be proof that for the first time since world war ii the international community be unite the leadership of the united nations once only a hope for ideal be now confirm its founder vision

 i be hearten that we be not be ask to bear alone the financial burden of this struggle last year our friend and ally provide the bulk of the economic cost of desert shield and now having receive commitment of over $ 40 billion for the first three month of 1991 i be confident they will do no less as we move through desert storm

 but the world have to wonder what the dictator of iraq be think if he think that by target innocent civilian in israel and saudi arabia that he will gain advantage he be dead wrong if he think that he will advance his cause through tragic and despicable environmental terrorism he be dead wrong and if he think that by abuse the coalition prisoner of war he will benefit he be dead wrong

 we will succeed in the gulf and when we do the world community will have send an endure warning to any dictator or despot present or future who contemplate outlaw aggression

 the world can therefore seize this opportunity to fulfill the long hold promise of a new world order where brutality will go unrewarded and aggression will meet collective resistance

 yes the united states bear a major share of leadership in this effort among the nation of the world only the united states of america have both the moral standing and the mean to back it up we be the only nation on this earth that could assemble the force of peace this be the burden of leadership and the strength that have make america the beacon of freedom in a search world

 this nation have never find glory in war our people have never want to abandon the blessing of home and work for distant land and deadly conflict if we fight in anger it be only because we have to fight at all and all of we yearn for a world where we will never have to fight again

 each of we will measure within ourselves the value of this great struggle any cost in life any cost be beyond our power to measure but the cost of close our eye to aggression be beyond mankind 's power to imagine this we do know our cause be just our cause be moral our cause be right

 let future generation understand the burden and the blessing of freedom let they say we stand where duty require we to stand let they know that together we affirm america and the world as a community of conscience

 the wind of change be with we now the force of freedom be together united we move toward the next century more confident than ever that we have the will at home and abroad to do what must be do the hard work of freedom

 may god bless the united states of america thank you very very much

 the coalition call upon the iraqi government to designate military commander to meet within 48 hour with their coalition counterpart at a place in the theater of operation to be specify to arrange for military aspect of the cease fire far i have ask secretary of state baker to request that the united nations security council meet to formulate the necessary arrangement for this war to be end

 this suspension of offensive combat operation be contingent upon iraq 's not fire upon any coalition force and not launch scud missile against any other country if iraq violate these term coalition force will be free to resume military operation

 at every opportunity i have say to the people of iraq that our quarrel be not with they but instead with their leadership and above all with saddam hussein this remain the case you the people of iraq be not our enemy we do not seek your destruction we have treat your pow 's with kindness coalition force fight this war only as a last resort and look forward to the day when iraq be lead by people prepare to live in peace with their neighbor

 and recognize this be a coalition effort let we not forget saudi general khalid britain 's general de la billiere or general roquejeoffre of france and all the other whose leadership play such a vital role and most importantly most importantly of all all those who serve in the field
 i thank the member of this congress support here for our troop in battle be overwhelming and above all i thank those whose unfailing love and support sustain our courageous man and woman i thank the american people
 tonight i come to this house to speak about the world the world after war the recent challenge could not have be clear saddam hussein be the villain kuwait the victim to the aid of this small country come nation from north america and europe from asia and south america from africa and the arab world all unite against aggression our uncommon coalition must now work in common purpose to forge a future that should never again be hold hostage to the dark side of human nature
 tonight in iraq saddam walk amidst ruin his war machine be crush his ability to threaten mass destruction be itself destroy his people have be lie to deny the truth and when his defeat legion come home all iraqis will see and feel the havoc he have work and this i promise you for all that saddam have do to his own people to the kuwaitis and to the entire world saddam and those around he be accountable
 all of we grieve for the victim of war for the people of kuwait and the suffering that scar the soul of that proud nation we grieve for all our fall soldier and their family for all the innocent catch up in this conflict and yes we grieve for the people of iraq a people who have never be our enemy my hope be that one day we will once again welcome they as friend into the community of nation our commitment to peace in the middle east do not end with the liberation of kuwait so tonight let i outline four key challenge to be meet
 first we must work together to create share security arrangement in the region our friend and ally in the middle east recognize that they will bear the bulk of the responsibility for regional security but we want they to know that just as we stand with they to repel aggression so now america stand ready to work with they to secure the peace this do not mean station u.s. ground force in the arabian peninsula but it do mean american participation in joint exercise involve both air and ground force it mean maintain a capable u.s. naval presence in the region just as we have for over 40 year let it be clear our vital national interest depend on a stable and secure gulf
 second we must act to control the proliferation of weapon of mass destruction and the missile use to deliver they it would be tragic if the nation of the middle east and persian gulf be now in the wake of war to embark on a new arm race iraq require special vigilance until iraq convince the world of its peaceful intention that its leader will not use new revenue to rearm and rebuild its menacing war machine iraq must not have access to the instrument of war
 and third we must work to create new opportunity for peace and stability in the middle east on the night i announce operation desert storm i express my hope that out of the horror of war might come new momentum for peace we have learn in the modern age geography can not guarantee security and security do not come from military power alone
 all of we know the depth of bitterness that have make the dispute between israel and its neighbor so painful and intractable yet in the conflict just conclude israel and many of the arab states have for the first time find themselves confront the same aggressor by now it should be plain to all party that peacemake in the middle east require compromise at the same time peace bring real benefit to everyone we must do all that we can to close the gap between israel and the arab states and between israelis and palestinians the tactic of terror lead absolutely nowhere there can be no substitute for diplomacy
 a comprehensive peace must be ground in united nations security council resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of territory for peace this principle must be elaborate to provide for israel 's security and recognition and at the same time for legitimate palestinian political right anything else would fail the twin test of fairness and security the time have come to put an end to arab israeli conflict
 the war with iraq be over the quest for solution to the problem in lebanon in the arab israeli dispute and in the gulf must go forward with new vigor and determination and i guarantee you no one will work hard for a stable peace in the region than we will
 fourth we must foster economic development for the sake of peace and progress the persian gulf and middle east form a region rich in natural resource with a wealth of untapped human potential resource once squander on military might must be redirect to more peaceful end we be already address the immediate economic consequence of iraq 's aggression now the challenge be to reach high to foster economic freedom and prosperity for all the people of the region
 by meet these four challenge we can build a framework for peace i have ask secretary of state baker to go to the middle east to begin the process he will go to listen to probe to offer suggestion to advance the search for peace and stability i have also ask he to raise the plight of the hostage hold in lebanon we have not forget they and we will not forget they
 to all the challenge that confront this region of the world there be no single solution no solely american answer but we can make a difference america will work tirelessly as a catalyst for positive change
 but we can not lead a new world abroad if at home it be politic as usual on american defense and diplomacy it be time to turn away from the temptation to protect unneeded weapon system and obsolete basis it be time to put an end to micromanagement of foreign and security assistance program micromanagement that humiliate our friend and ally and hamstring our diplomacy it be time to rise above the parochial and the pork barrel to do what be necessary what be right and what will enable this nation to play the leadership role require of we
 the consequence of the conflict in the gulf reach far beyond the confine of the middle east twice before in this century an entire world be convulse by war twice this century out of the horror of war hope emerge for endure peace twice before those hope prove to be a distant dream beyond the grasp of man until now the world we have know have be a world divide a world of barbed wire and concrete block conflict and cold war
 now we can see a new world come into view a world in which there be the very real prospect of a new world order in the word of winston churchill a world order in which the principle of justice and fair play protect the weak against the strong a world where the united nations free from cold war stalemate be poise to fulfill the historic vision of its founder a world in which freedom and respect for human right find a home among all nation the gulf war put this new world to its first test and my fellow americans we pass that test
 for the sake of our principle for the sake of the kuwaiti people we stand our ground because the world would not look the other way ambassador al sabah tonight kuwait be free and we be very happy about that
 tonight as our troop begin to come home let we recognize that the hard work of freedom still call we forward we have learn the hard lesson of history the victory over iraq be not wage as a war to end all war even the new world order can not guarantee an era of perpetual peace but endure peace must be our mission our success in the gulf will shape not only the new world order we seek but our mission here at home
 in the war just end there be clear cut objective timetable and above all an override imperative to achieve result we must bring that same sense of self discipline that same sense of urgency to the way we meet challenge here at home in my state of the union address and in my budget i define a comprehensive agenda to prepare for the next american century
 our first priority be to get this economy roll again the fear and uncertainty cause by the gulf crisis be understandable but now that the war be over oil price be down interest rate be down and confidence be rightly come back americans can move forward to lend spend and invest in this the strong economy on earth
 we must also enact the legislation that be key to build a well america for example in 1990 we enact an historic clean air act and now we have propose a national energy strategy we pass a child care bill that put power in the hand of parent and today we be ready to do the same thing with our school and expand choice in education we pass a crime bill that make a useful start in fight crime and drug this year we be send to congress our comprehensive crime package to finish the job we pass the landmark americans with disabilities act and now we have send forward our civil right bill we also pass the aviation bill this year we have send up our new highway bill and these be just a few of our pende proposal for reform and renewal
 so tonight i call on the congress to move forward aggressively on our domestic front let us begin with two initiative we should be able to agree on quickly transportation and crime and then let us build on success with those and enact the rest of our agenda if our force could win the ground war in 100 hour then surely the congress can pass this legislation in 100 day let that be a promise we make tonight to the american people
 when i speak in this house about the state of our union i ask all of you if we can selflessly confront evil for the sake of good in a land so far away then surely we can make this land all that it should be in the time since then the brave man and woman of desert storm accomplish more than even they may realize they set out to confront an enemy abroad and in the process they transform a nation at home think of the way they go about their mission with confidence and quiet pride think about their sense of duty about all they teach we about our value about ourselves
 we hear so often about our young people in turmoil how our child fall short how our school fail we how american product and american worker be second class well do not you believe it the america we see in desert storm be first class talent and they do it use america 's state of the art technology we see the excellence embody in the patriot missile and the patriot who make it work and we see soldier who know about honor and bravery and duty and country and the world shake power of these simple word there be something noble and majestic about the pride about the patriotism that we feel tonight
 so to everyone here and everyone watch at home think about the man and woman of desert storm let we honor they with our gratitude let we comfort the family of the fallen and remember each precious life lose
 let we learn from they as well let we honor those who have serve we by serve other let we honor they as individual man and woman of every race all creed and color by set the face of this nation against discrimination bigotry and hate eliminate they
 i be sure that many of you see on the television the unforgettable scene of four terrify iraqi soldier surrender they emerge from their bunker break tear stream from their eye fear the bad and then there be an american soldier remember what he say he say it be okay you be all right now you be all right now that scene say a lot about america a lot about who we be americans be a caring people we be a good people a generous people let we always be care and good and generous in all we do
 soon very soon our troop will begin the march we have all be wait for their march home and i have direct secretary cheney to begin the immediate return of american combat unit from the gulf less than 2 hour from now the first planeload of american soldier will lift off from saudi arabia head for the u.s.a. that plane will carry the man and woman of the 24th mechanized infantry division bind for fort stewart georgia this be just the beginning of a steady flow of american troop come home let their return remind we that all those who have go before be link with we in the long line of freedom 's march

president gorbachev good evening lady and gentleman the basic part of the visit the official visit of the president of the united states of america to the soviet union be behind we and there be many thing that be important which be still ahead within the framework of this big political international event

 these day be full of very substantial dialog over a wide spectrum of issue and i must say that it be kind of difficult for i

 at this point president bush 's earphone for translation fail

 i guess i will have to repeat from the very beginning what i say in that case laughter

 q. number two mr. president laughter

 president gorbachev now do you hear i now be everything okay it be tolerable

 i already say address the international press that we see the official visit of the president of the united states to the soviet union as a big event in our relation really a global event and i want to say that these day we have do a great deal of work which i think will create difficulty for i and the president in order to present it in condensed form and nevertheless this visit to some extent sum up the last stage of our cooperation at a very fundamental dramatic time of development of event in the world when both the president of the united states of america and the soviet union be place in very difficult circumstance unusual one which demand from they a great feeling of responsibility in take very important decision which have have consequence and will have consequence in the further development of our cooperation and event in the world

 and so with the president he and i do not lose time and immediately at our first meeting we summarize the overall situation in a fast change world and try from these position to look upon our cooperation evaluate our joint effort and try to map out some contour direction of development of this cooperation which would correspond to these change condition within which we have to act

 the president show great interest in the event take place in our country our domestic process i try to satisfy his interest and do this on my part with a great deal of satisfaction since in his interest i feel a desire to understand even more what be go on in our country and moreover i feel also a feeling of solidarity in this

 we have an interesting substantive discussion and perhaps for the first time it cover the following in our bilateral cooperation for the first time over the past period we probably accent rather strongly what our economic relationship should be like how we have to work together in this importance here so that or so that relationship in this area would be appropriate to the international dialog which we have reach in other area

 and here we have note on the basis of mutual understanding if not president bush will say so that there must be movement in accommodation as well obviously one can do a lot in the area of reform so that we can include ourselves in international economic tie to play by the rule of the game i like this expression i have not invent any other one for the time be that be why i use the term i be familiar with we have to do a great deal and we have make our choice to continue reform democratic change and especially now to move decisively forward towards a market relationship a relationship of property and so on

 it be clear that our success in these internal affair be tie to a great extent to the process of reform in the federation and i hope that i have satisfy the interest of the president about the state of this as of today we both understand that this be very important for the success of our work and thus we must change we must understand and will understand here in the soviet union that the basic responsibility for the fate of this country for reform for the making of decision which be very important be our prerogative our responsibility

 and obviously we be very interested in the more fruitful cooperation with the country of the west and in the light of continue the discussion which we have in london within the framework of my meeting at the g 7 we speak also about this subject as well and i try to develop a thesis which i express in london that we hope to see accommodate movement of the western country because they too in their approach in the sphere of economic cooperation must accommodate we

 we be talk about remove barrier which be connect with decision take during the cold war during the arm race this be a different time different wind be blow and we must reevaluate all these decision i do not think they need to be preserve when our relationship be different now and we want they not only to be preserve but to be more dynamic to be base more firmly on trust

 obviously the question arise about the participation of the soviet union in international economic organization and i must say for the first time we talk substantially about specific sphere of cooperation in implement certain project on the basis of bilateral cooperation to speak about this briefly we speak about cooperate in the field of energy especially in the area of conversion we have great possibility here and specifically in the sphere in which we be very interested that be the agricultural sphere especially food distribution

 in this regard i transmit certain material to the president as in a memoir the same be do by the foreign minister bessmertnykh give it to the secretary of state mr. baker in a memoir about those project in which we could cooperate fruitfully this be a very interesting and substantive project we would want to act in such a way that in implement these project all of they to give a possibility to each other to earn money in other word the process go forward and there be benefit from it

 but there be sphere of cooperation where movement forward will not give we a chance because of additional production to make these calculation like in the area of food production for example in the food area here there could be interesting accomplishment an interesting project but what we get as the result we need we have problem in the food area very acute one but we can not offer this to the united states they have no interest now in buy food from we so we must implement other project where we could earn hard currency and use this and i have name such sphere many such sphere

 we talk in general about continue such work soon we will have competent group of specialist head by important representative of business circle to realize these project and thus i expand this part and the other part will be short for the first time we discuss very substantially the sphere of bilateral relation and not only with regard to disarmament political dialog and a resolution of world problem but have such a businesslike discussion and i greet this i welcome it and i hope that it will have positive consequence

 then the president and i think about the following and what do we do next we have sign the treaty and what be next we have congratulate each other and our people and the world with the fact that such great progress have be accomplish as a result of almost a decade of work and what be next

 and we do not want simply to be pragmatist here we want to look at the problem of security stability from the point of view of the present day reality or should we simply continue the negotiation which already be take place and there be many problem which still need to be discuss or should we also look at the world from a somewhat different position from today 's height with the new reality which exist

 and i think that be the main item of our exchange because without understand each other in this it be hard to find the key to resolution of specific issue we agree to continue discussion on this issue and even set up the mechanism which must be implement in order to do this

 nevertheless we also examine very many specific issue of disarmament without our we do not leave unattended problem of the middle east and i must say and if the president consider it appropriate he could name certain thing and if you have question we could discuss this we have work out a joint document on this i have in mind our common position with regard to the middle east i think that this be a very important result of our joint work and i think that the fact that this position will be publicly announce will have serious influence on this process and we consider that it be in a decisive stage and we should not and here i want to use what our minister use to have a window of opportunity in order to really achieve progress in this very sensitive area of international politic

 the president and i talk about the situation in europe in the context of implement the agreement the helsinki agreement the paris charter and especially with regard to the process take place in that region and specifically note the situation in yugoslavia and express our position our understanding our approach to the resolution of this issue a very serious one which worry many of we also in a joint statement we express this

 i must say that we also move forward and discuss other thing we try to also look at many global process and in this regard do not pass by many issue of international politic compare our point of view in some issue we reserve the opportunity to come back to this we put off discuss this in some case we require consultation on the u.s. side in other case we need time to study the issue but that mean that the process will continue and in this case as well we note the necessity of cooperation and interaction in resolve those many international issue which exist and which must be resolve

 the atmosphere be a very warm one sincere frank open and today we sense the representative of the press say that the press do not want to interfere with we somewhere out in a village to talk one on one and in an uninhibited manner we do all of this this be also important it be very good

 one of the member of the delegation i ask the question how do you feel a very important person and the answer be like at home and that be the kind of atmosphere which we work in

 i be satisfied with the fact that political dialog be develop in this way once in this hall and there be many witness here i want to repeat this i talk about this to the president he know this as well that i be convinced that without what we have today in our relationship such a character of soviet american relation we could hardly count on everything that have happen in the past year and we could hardly have interact in such a way when the world place before we very serious problem

 if this have be in another time if we have face such problem in another time it would be difficult to say what would have happen but today we even understand well the value of our cooperation the fact that this be necessary so perhaps this be not a question of a platonic love but a deep understanding of the fact that as country and state we need each other today and tomorrow and i feel and i know that our people welcome this direction of development of our relation between our country

 and from this point of view it move ahead far ahead our cooperation and thus i want to ask the pardon of the president and the press i be the host and i maybe misuse it but perhaps i could listen to your comment as well that i be speak so much

 i understand that you almost agree with everything i have say laughter

 president bush what i hear i like laughter

 once again this might be an appropriate time for barbara and i to thank the president and mrs. gorbachev for this fantastic hospitality and yes i could not agree more about the productive nature of the talk the enhancement of mutual understanding this be not diplomatic language in my view this be fact

 you know my view on the start agreement indeed it be the culmination of a long and historic negotiation and i happen to believe that the winner on this be the young people not just in the soviet union not just in the united states but all around the world and we be take major step in transform our economic relation president gorbachev touch on some of this

 but we be go to send up the trade agreement to the u.s. congress we be go to grant most favor nation status now that the technicality have be work out we have fulfil thus our malta goal mr. president of normalize our economic relationship we agree here to tackle the next challenge president gorbachev talk about that further economic reform in the u.s.s.r. and seek to integrate the soviet economy into the international system we be go forward with space cooperation cooperation in the environment and we have several joint project in mind there

 building on our historic cooperation during the gulf crisis we discuss the president and i discuss our partnership in resolve longstanding regional problem as you mention we be put out statement on yugoslavia central america and indeed i want to comment now just briefly on the middle east before take your question

 we do reaffirm our mutual commitment to promote peace and genuine reconciliation between the arab states israel and the palestinians and we believe there be an historic opportunity right now to launch a process that can lead to a just and endure peace and to a comprehensive settlement in the middle east we share the strong conviction that this historic opportunity must not be lose and while recognize that peace can not be impose it can only result from direct negotiation between the party the united states and the soviet union pledge to do their utmost to promote and sustain the peacemaking process

 and to that end the united states and the soviet union act as cosponsor be go to work to convene an october peace conference design to launch bilateral and multilateral negotiation invitation to the conference will be issue at least 10 day prior to the date the conference be to convene and in the interim secretary baker and foreign minister bessmertnykh will continue to work with the party to prepare for this conference and i be today ask secretary of state jim baker to return to the middle east to obtain israel 's answer to our proposal for peace

 and again my thank to you and i would be prepared to take question along with you sir

 yugoslavia

 q. one question to comrade gorbachev you say that you talk with mr. bush about yugoslavia what be the essence of that conversation about yugoslavia

 and mr. bush when you receive i several year ago in the white house in your capacity at that time as vice president of the united states of america you say to i that the relation between our two country there be a special relationship between yugoslavia and the united states be that definition still valid and whether the united states be still support yugoslavian territorial integrity thank you

 president gorbachev you ask about the essence of the conversation i will then make use of the fact that i will relate the content of the u.s.-soviet statement on yugoslavia this be the result of our conversation on this subject we both country with a deep concern have note the dramatic development of event in yugoslavia and we have be against the use of force and call upon all side to abide by the agreement on the cease fire we the soviet union and the u.s. proceed from the premise that the resolution of issue must be find by the people of yugoslavia themselves on the basis of democratic principle through peaceful negotiation and a constructive approach

 we emphasize the necessity of have all side respect the basic principle indicate in the helsinki act and the paris charter the u.s. and the u.s.s.r. support the effort undertake by the csce country specifically the european community step to resolve the problem this be the essence of the statement

 president bush i would only add sir that inasmuch as that be a joint statement that express our continue position as well

 middle east peace talks

 q. mr. president can i ask you the fact that you be go ahead with this peace conference do that mean that you have israel 's acceptance of the outline of your condition for a peace conference or be there still a hangup or have you get a commitment from mr. shamir

 president bush well i would wait and let secretary baker answer that question after this next meeting and if i have to express a degree of optimism or pessimism i would say i be a little more optimistic today but the visit of jim baker now be for what we say here to obtain israel 's answer to our proposal for peace and if i have the answer in my pocket or he do i would expect that we would say so

 soviet u.s. relations

 q. i have a question to both president you discuss many question of international issue bilateral issue you sign a unique agreement today what do you leave for the next meeting and can we say when you be plan to have it

 president gorbachev i think that what we discuss today and what we have set in motion both with regard to a political dialog and a continuation of the disarmament process and new subject in the area of economic cooperation and trade interaction in the resolution of important issue include regional conflict which unfortunately still take place and especially since we have begin a significant discussion about the concept of future strategic stability that mean that we have many issue to discuss and many meeting ahead so i think that our contact will continue

 but i would express myself in favor of the following perhaps not always can we go and this make the position of president very specific but it be hard for they than for the ministers of foreign affairs to travel and discuss issue of foreign affair but nevertheless the president and i have develop a method of conversation we exchange opinion by telephone as soon as we have a need concern or simply to exchange opinion about something important we do this by telephone and this take place on a regular basis

 and secondly we regularly exchange letter and this exchange of opinion have not cease even in recent day when we have already reach agreement with the president we be expect he here so we have many channel in order to support this very high level of cooperation which we have and i think a great role will be give to our departments the ministries of foreign affairs but other departments as well because we have new area of cooperation

 president bush i would only add to that that though no date be set it be my view and i have not always hold this view that a meeting without an agenda be a good idea from time to time between the soviet president and the president of the united states and with this president gorbachev talk about arm control and regional problem and other problem but as this dynamic autonomy begin to move a chance for a dynamic economy here there be go to be much more to talk about on the economic side than we have ever have before cooperation partnership joint venture the whole approach to economic that he have endorse that be go to benefit i believe the soviet union and i think there be enormous potential for the united states

 so it be my view that we have get plenty to talk about and i for one would be prepare to as i have state before to have a meeting where there be not a crisis out there to be manage rather we can be sure that we be not two ship pass in the night the analogy i use i believe in malta appropriately laughter and i look forward to future meeting because you get a lot do where you can not put out sign a 3 point program or a 20 point protocol but a lot be do just by the kind of conversation we have have today

 lithuania

 q. president gorbachev there be an ugly border incident in lithuania last night in which a number of lithuanian border guard be kill i wonder if we could have your reaction and any explanation you might have of it

 also president bush any reaction from you in light particularly of your call yesterday afternoon for freedom for the baltic states

 president gorbachev you know we receive this information when we be talk outside the city the first information be such that the incident be on the border between lithuania and byelorussia and when one of the citizen of byelorussia go in the direction of lithuania and at the custom point where he be approach he see two wounded people and four that die he quickly relate this information and now the state security agency of lithuania and byelorussia the chairman of the state committee on security offer also to help in the cooperation so now we be investigate this

 i must say that in addition to regret we must simply sympathize with the family of the people that die and i myself must say that we be do everything in order not only to take action but also to avoid such excess such conflict on the basis of resolution of basic issue and we have take such basic mutual decision with regard to issue concern armenia and azerbaijan there be a dialog and the fast and more productive the dialog be the more effort there be to break it down not everyone like this process that be develop in such a direction and it be hard for we to say what happen we hear version the president and i but these be version this be not important at any rate i will be monitor this and we will tell you what it be that happen in reality

 q. i just want to get your reaction sir to the incident in light of your call yesterday afternoon for freedom for the baltic states

 president bush well i do not think there be a connection but i do regret the violence i listen to what president gorbachev say about the discussion we clearly favor negotiation he know that that would lead to a reduction of cross border violence from both side and obviously i would like to join in express my regret to those family whose loved one be lose

 but the president immediately get on this and say they be conduct an investigation i think there be hope that the investigation will be cooperative between the lithuanian side and byelorussia 's side and so we can not prejudge the incident but i have an opportunity to express my view to president gorbachev on the whole question of the baltic states i do not think it be fair to link a border incident before you know what happen to that question however

 soviet economic integration

 q. mr. president how far do you go after london in move ahead in the integration of the u.s.s.r. into the international economy be there progress reach in this area to both president

 president gorbachev perhaps you can begin

 president bush well let i say that be a serious objective to start with secondly i believe that active participation in these international financial institution and the status that be deem well by the g 7 be the most important thing that the soviets can do right now i have free up as you hear today certain trade benefit or normalize the trade procedure that in my view will help and we have do that since the meeting in london

 but the answer be full participation full benefit of these international institution require full knowledge and step towards the privatization and toward convertability all the thing that i believe the soviet union want

 so work with the international organization and then bilaterally do what we have do and other country will be do too i be sure to remove the underbrush remove the barrier to bilateral economic cooperation so quite a bit have happen between we since paris and we look forward with our representative in these international organization to work very cooperatively with the soviet leader

 president gorbachev i understand that i be suppose to comment on this as well since the question be to both president i will be brief since i have already express my opinion about this london be the beginning of a very important process this be the meaning of the london meeting and one must judge about this in that light

 it be very important that after london there be a desire on both part to work out a mechanism which would permit the shifting of this cooperation give the political will of the leadership of the western country in the soviet union we think that we should have special structure which would keep tab of the cooperation between the soviet union and the g 7 country and first of all in the area of investment so the process would be easy in the taking of decision of mutual interest

 and it be good that the mechanism have start to be implement which we discuss in london and the minister of finances of england be already here we first talk about the fact that there would be visit of the minister of finance the secretary of the treasury of the u.s. and the representative of the frg so in other word there would be the mechanism of implement specific area of cooperation and this be very important that there be a mechanism for real interaction

 and finally the president mention that on the part of the u.s. an important decision will be take to make trade between our country easy i would say that i mention this in pass but we often discuss this with the president i ask and we agree to study the question of cocom restriction today because many billion dollar project which be ready to go and even sign be not be implement because of the fact that they have element that come under cocom restriction

 and therefore a very serious process have start and i think that this will continue and grow strong be more specific it will give result there be a will and a desire to do this it be very important

 nuclear weapons

 q. i would ask both of you to think back to the 1986 reykjavik summit when ronald reagan horrify quite a few american nuclear expert and almost all of the european leader by give serious consideration to your proposal president gorbachev for a ban on all nuclear weapon in the end reagan say no because of the belief that nuclear deterrence have in fact keep the peace at that time you have a massive conventional edge in europe though since then we have have the cfe treaty why now be the two of you not say we will now work towards a total nuclear ban do you still believe in the efficacy of nuclear deterrence in keep the peace particularly sir i ask you president bush give the fact that some of these breakaway republic they have nuclear weapon in there and who know what would happen if they declare independence

 president bush the very fact that i would not suggest that a breakaway republic be go to use a nuclear weapon against the united states but i would suggest that we have every reason in the world to be concern about renegade not in these area perhaps i hope not get hold of nuclear weapon and that be one of the reason i strongly support our gpal program that be be debate in the senate right now

 but in my view other country do possess nuclear weapon it be not just the soviet union and the united states and i do believe that we be on the right path by the path that president gorbachev have outline today on follow on exist agreement so rather than try to have a ethereal or a utopian answer let us follow through practically as he suggest and then as far as the u.s. be concern i would like we to go forward with a system that put nobody at threat nobody at risk the only thing at risk be an errant nuclear missile aim at a country and that be why i support the defensive approach and that be why i think one of the lesson out of the iraq war and maybe president gorbachev read this differently be that defense work and though we be talk about a different concept now an expand concept a more high tech concept i think a lot of life be save by defense so that be my reply

 president gorbachev i will say a few word i think that the argument which you want to ascribe to i that in my policy i look upon nuclear weapon as an element of deterrence be not true i have not say this yes we get involve in the arm race in a very serious way thank god as we say in russian that we stop this and turn it back and this be a great accomplishment since we understand where we be head

 but it be hard to resolve all these issue which have pile up and all these weapon that have pile up and i think that there be still a lot that we have to do we have map out a few thing for the future and then there will probably also be question put to all member of the nuclear club and they also have to think about what to do with nuclear weapon in the future

 and finally we must very carefully act about have the mechanism which we have create and which seem have work but apparently not effectively enough about nonproliferation of nuclear weapon this be one of the important topic of our conversation with the president during these day for if certain country will lower their arm and disarm and head in the direction of a nonnuclear world and at the same time other will find way to develop the process in order to have their own nuclear weapon then we will have a situation which be absurd

 so in continue to support nuclear disarmament and within the framework of the negotiation process which we have we have agree to continue this we have the question of truly improve the mechanism of nonproliferation nuclear technology in order missile technology in order to create an unsurmountable barrier in this area i think this be one of the most important thing we have to do today

 q. what significance do the process of european integration have in your conversation with the president for example the postwar unification of europe what image of this be the most acceptable to you from the point of view of the soviet union for example the image of a general de gaulle europe of fatherland country with decision be make on a national level or a united state of europe with common decision be make among they thank you

 europe

 president gorbachev first of all you can probably guess that everything that happen in europe in the world we have always look towards europe for everything that happen in europe in our area i do not want to list they have a great importance for the development in the world so undoubtedly the president and i note the positive development which be take place in europe and we note support of the document aim at create a new europe and we see that the soviet union and the u.s. must participate very actively in build a new europe all of this have exist and continue to exist and we feel a responsibility to do this

 but you ask the question about how i think perhaps you be a little hasty because when we be create a certain schematic and then try to impose it then we get one result when a process be be develop in a logical way within the helsinki process a political process of choice then we find that new form of cooperation and new institute come into being

 now i would say the following we must within the framework of the document the general path map out in the helsinki and the paris agreement act in such a way that the old institution be transform in the interest of a new europe so that they serve the interest of a single economic territory a single security of europe a legal aspect and so this be what we must aim for that mean when the old institution when they change we have to bear this in mind but apparently we will also have new institution which will arise which will serve this process

 and now if we have for example a common energy approach there will be mechanism of administer this and will have a great significance in the fate of europe and the process to realize this thus in go along this path without destroy the old institution in create new one we probably will find the form gradually to resolve these issue but if we declare a specific course but will keep the old structure institution without change they at all then again there can be a process of simply regroup of force in europe and there can be new confrontation which would come into be with a different distribution of force

 i be not in favor of this so i would more quickly go through the process of creation of new institution and would stimulate those tendency which would move we towards a united europe

 i do not think that here we need to have language vanish culture tradition vanish i think this would be a mistake if we set ourselves such a goal i think we should take into consideration those specific characteristic and tradition the history of the people but also aim for their unification i think this be compatible although we see that there be also an explosion of nationalism separatism effort to unravel everything this be a dangerous process i think that if we follow a path of chaotic development of such process then we will get into a bad situation

 so i be for the transformation of all institution i be for new institution which would act in the interest of unification process in europe

 mr. fitzwater we use our allotted time thank you very much



 president gorbachev good evening lady and gentleman the basic part of the visit the official visit of the president of the united states of america to the soviet union be behind we and there be many thing that be important which be still ahead within the framework of this big political international event

 these day be full of very substantial dialog over a wide spectrum of issue and i must say that it be kind of difficult for i

 at this point president bush 's earphone for translation fail

 i already say address the international press that we see the official visit of the president of the united states to the soviet union as a big event in our relation really a global event and i want to say that these day we have do a great deal of work which i think will create difficulty for i and the president in order to present it in condensed form and nevertheless this visit to some extent sum up the last stage of our cooperation at a very fundamental dramatic time of development of event in the world when both the president of the united states of america and the soviet union be place in very difficult circumstance unusual one which demand from they a great feeling of responsibility in take very important decision which have have consequence and will have consequence in the further development of our cooperation and event in the world

 and so with the president he and i do not lose time and immediately at our first meeting we summarize the overall situation in a fast change world and try from these position to look upon our cooperation evaluate our joint effort and try to map out some contour direction of development of this cooperation which would correspond to these change condition within which we have to act

 and here we have note on the basis of mutual understanding if not president bush will say so that there must be movement in accommodation as well obviously one can do a lot in the area of reform so that we can include ourselves in international economic tie to play by the rule of the game i like this expression i have not invent any other one for the time be that be why i use the term i be familiar with we have to do a great deal and we have make our choice to continue reform democratic change and especially now to move decisively forward towards a market relationship a relationship of property and so on

 it be clear that our success in these internal affair be tie to a great extent to the process of reform in the federation and i hope that i have satisfy the interest of the president about the state of this as of today we both understand that this be very important for the success of our work and thus we must change we must understand and will understand here in the soviet union that the basic responsibility for the fate of this country for reform for the making of decision which be very important be our prerogative our responsibility

 but there be sphere of cooperation where movement forward will not give we a chance because of additional production to make these calculation like in the area of food production for example in the food area here there could be interesting accomplishment an interesting project but what we get as the result we need we have problem in the food area very acute one but we can not offer this to the united states they have no interest now in buy food from we so we must implement other project where we could earn hard currency and use this and i have name such sphere many such sphere

 we talk in general about continue such work soon we will have competent group of specialist head by important representative of business circle to realize these project and thus i expand this part and the other part will be short for the first time we discuss very substantially the sphere of bilateral relation and not only with regard to disarmament political dialog and a resolution of world problem but have such a businesslike discussion and i greet this i welcome it and i hope that it will have positive consequence

 then the president and i think about the following and what do we do next we have sign the treaty and what be next we have congratulate each other and our people and the world with the fact that such great progress have be accomplish as a result of almost a decade of work and what be next

 and we do not want simply to be pragmatist here we want to look at the problem of security stability from the point of view of the present day reality or should we simply continue the negotiation which already be take place and there be many problem which still need to be discuss or should we also look at the world from a somewhat different position from today 's height with the new reality which exist

 and i think that be the main item of our exchange because without understand each other in this it be hard to find the key to resolution of specific issue we agree to continue discussion on this issue and even set up the mechanism which must be implement in order to do this

 nevertheless we also examine very many specific issue of disarmament without our we do not leave unattended problem of the middle east and i must say and if the president consider it appropriate he could name certain thing and if you have question we could discuss this we have work out a joint document on this i have in mind our common position with regard to the middle east i think that this be a very important result of our joint work and i think that the fact that this position will be publicly announce will have serious influence on this process and we consider that it be in a decisive stage and we should not and here i want to use what our minister use to have a window of opportunity in order to really achieve progress in this very sensitive area of international politic

 the president and i talk about the situation in europe in the context of implement the agreement the helsinki agreement the paris charter and especially with regard to the process take place in that region and specifically note the situation in yugoslavia and express our position our understanding our approach to the resolution of this issue a very serious one which worry many of we also in a joint statement we express this

 i must say that we also move forward and discuss other thing we try to also look at many global process and in this regard do not pass by many issue of international politic compare our point of view in some issue we reserve the opportunity to come back to this we put off discuss this in some case we require consultation on the u.s. side in other case we need time to study the issue but that mean that the process will continue and in this case as well we note the necessity of cooperation and interaction in resolve those many international issue which exist and which must be resolve

 the atmosphere be a very warm one sincere frank open and today we sense the representative of the press say that the press do not want to interfere with we somewhere out in a village to talk one on one and in an uninhibited manner we do all of this this be also important it be very good

 one of the member of the delegation i ask the question how do you feel a very important person and the answer be like at home and that be the kind of atmosphere which we work in

 i be satisfied with the fact that political dialog be develop in this way once in this hall and there be many witness here i want to repeat this i talk about this to the president he know this as well that i be convinced that without what we have today in our relationship such a character of soviet american relation we could hardly count on everything that have happen in the past year and we could hardly have interact in such a way when the world place before we very serious problem

 if this have be in another time if we have face such problem in another time it would be difficult to say what would have happen but today we even understand well the value of our cooperation the fact that this be necessary so perhaps this be not a question of a platonic love but a deep understanding of the fact that as country and state we need each other today and tomorrow and i feel and i know that our people welcome this direction of development of our relation between our country

 and from this point of view it move ahead far ahead our cooperation and thus i want to ask the pardon of the president and the press i be the host and i maybe misuse it but perhaps i could listen to your comment as well that i be speak so much

 i understand that you almost agree with everything i have say laughter

 president bush what i hear i like laughter

 once again this might be an appropriate time for barbara and i to thank the president and mrs. gorbachev for this fantastic hospitality and yes i could not agree more about the productive nature of the talk the enhancement of mutual understanding this be not diplomatic language in my view this be fact

 you know my view on the start agreement indeed it be the culmination of a long and historic negotiation and i happen to believe that the winner on this be the young people not just in the soviet union not just in the united states but all around the world and we be take major step in transform our economic relation president gorbachev touch on some of this

 but we be go to send up the trade agreement to the u.s. congress we be go to grant most favor nation status now that the technicality have be work out we have fulfil thus our malta goal mr. president of normalize our economic relationship we agree here to tackle the next challenge president gorbachev talk about that further economic reform in the u.s.s.r. and seek to integrate the soviet economy into the international system we be go forward with space cooperation cooperation in the environment and we have several joint project in mind there

 building on our historic cooperation during the gulf crisis we discuss the president and i discuss our partnership in resolve longstanding regional problem as you mention we be put out statement on yugoslavia central america and indeed i want to comment now just briefly on the middle east before take your question

 we do reaffirm our mutual commitment to promote peace and genuine reconciliation between the arab states israel and the palestinians and we believe there be an historic opportunity right now to launch a process that can lead to a just and endure peace and to a comprehensive settlement in the middle east we share the strong conviction that this historic opportunity must not be lose and while recognize that peace can not be impose it can only result from direct negotiation between the party the united states and the soviet union pledge to do their utmost to promote and sustain the peacemaking process

 and to that end the united states and the soviet union act as cosponsor be go to work to convene an october peace conference design to launch bilateral and multilateral negotiation invitation to the conference will be issue at least 10 day prior to the date the conference be to convene and in the interim secretary baker and foreign minister bessmertnykh will continue to work with the party to prepare for this conference and i be today ask secretary of state jim baker to return to the middle east to obtain israel 's answer to our proposal for peace

 and again my thank to you and i would be prepared to take question along with you sir

 yugoslavia

 q. one question to comrade gorbachev you say that you talk with mr. bush about yugoslavia what be the essence of that conversation about yugoslavia

 and mr. bush when you receive i several year ago in the white house in your capacity at that time as vice president of the united states of america you say to i that the relation between our two country there be a special relationship between yugoslavia and the united states be that definition still valid and whether the united states be still support yugoslavian territorial integrity thank you

 president gorbachev you ask about the essence of the conversation i will then make use of the fact that i will relate the content of the u.s.-soviet statement on yugoslavia this be the result of our conversation on this subject we both country with a deep concern have note the dramatic development of event in yugoslavia and we have be against the use of force and call upon all side to abide by the agreement on the cease fire we the soviet union and the u.s. proceed from the premise that the resolution of issue must be find by the people of yugoslavia themselves on the basis of democratic principle through peaceful negotiation and a constructive approach

 we emphasize the necessity of have all side respect the basic principle indicate in the helsinki act and the paris charter the u.s. and the u.s.s.r. support the effort undertake by the csce country specifically the european community step to resolve the problem this be the essence of the statement

 president bush i would only add sir that inasmuch as that be a joint statement that express our continue position as well

 middle east peace talks

 q. mr. president can i ask you the fact that you be go ahead with this peace conference do that mean that you have israel 's acceptance of the outline of your condition for a peace conference or be there still a hangup or have you get a commitment from mr. shamir

 president bush well i would wait and let secretary baker answer that question after this next meeting and if i have to express a degree of optimism or pessimism i would say i be a little more optimistic today but the visit of jim baker now be for what we say here to obtain israel 's answer to our proposal for peace and if i have the answer in my pocket or he do i would expect that we would say so

 soviet u.s. relations

 q. i have a question to both president you discuss many question of international issue bilateral issue you sign a unique agreement today what do you leave for the next meeting and can we say when you be plan to have it

 president gorbachev i think that what we discuss today and what we have set in motion both with regard to a political dialog and a continuation of the disarmament process and new subject in the area of economic cooperation and trade interaction in the resolution of important issue include regional conflict which unfortunately still take place and especially since we have begin a significant discussion about the concept of future strategic stability that mean that we have many issue to discuss and many meeting ahead so i think that our contact will continue

 but i would express myself in favor of the following perhaps not always can we go and this make the position of president very specific but it be hard for they than for the ministers of foreign affairs to travel and discuss issue of foreign affair but nevertheless the president and i have develop a method of conversation we exchange opinion by telephone as soon as we have a need concern or simply to exchange opinion about something important we do this by telephone and this take place on a regular basis

 and secondly we regularly exchange letter and this exchange of opinion have not cease even in recent day when we have already reach agreement with the president we be expect he here so we have many channel in order to support this very high level of cooperation which we have and i think a great role will be give to our departments the ministries of foreign affairs but other departments as well because we have new area of cooperation

 president bush i would only add to that that though no date be set it be my view and i have not always hold this view that a meeting without an agenda be a good idea from time to time between the soviet president and the president of the united states and with this president gorbachev talk about arm control and regional problem and other problem but as this dynamic autonomy begin to move a chance for a dynamic economy here there be go to be much more to talk about on the economic side than we have ever have before cooperation partnership joint venture the whole approach to economic that he have endorse that be go to benefit i believe the soviet union and i think there be enormous potential for the united states

 so it be my view that we have get plenty to talk about and i for one would be prepare to as i have state before to have a meeting where there be not a crisis out there to be manage rather we can be sure that we be not two ship pass in the night the analogy i use i believe in malta appropriately laughter and i look forward to future meeting because you get a lot do where you can not put out sign a 3 point program or a 20 point protocol but a lot be do just by the kind of conversation we have have today

 lithuania

 q. president gorbachev there be an ugly border incident in lithuania last night in which a number of lithuanian border guard be kill i wonder if we could have your reaction and any explanation you might have of it

 also president bush any reaction from you in light particularly of your call yesterday afternoon for freedom for the baltic states

 president gorbachev you know we receive this information when we be talk outside the city the first information be such that the incident be on the border between lithuania and byelorussia and when one of the citizen of byelorussia go in the direction of lithuania and at the custom point where he be approach he see two wounded people and four that die he quickly relate this information and now the state security agency of lithuania and byelorussia the chairman of the state committee on security offer also to help in the cooperation so now we be investigate this

 i must say that in addition to regret we must simply sympathize with the family of the people that die and i myself must say that we be do everything in order not only to take action but also to avoid such excess such conflict on the basis of resolution of basic issue and we have take such basic mutual decision with regard to issue concern armenia and azerbaijan there be a dialog and the fast and more productive the dialog be the more effort there be to break it down not everyone like this process that be develop in such a direction and it be hard for we to say what happen we hear version the president and i but these be version this be not important at any rate i will be monitor this and we will tell you what it be that happen in reality

 q. i just want to get your reaction sir to the incident in light of your call yesterday afternoon for freedom for the baltic states

 president bush well i do not think there be a connection but i do regret the violence i listen to what president gorbachev say about the discussion we clearly favor negotiation he know that that would lead to a reduction of cross border violence from both side and obviously i would like to join in express my regret to those family whose loved one be lose

 but the president immediately get on this and say they be conduct an investigation i think there be hope that the investigation will be cooperative between the lithuanian side and byelorussia 's side and so we can not prejudge the incident but i have an opportunity to express my view to president gorbachev on the whole question of the baltic states i do not think it be fair to link a border incident before you know what happen to that question however

 soviet economic integration

 q. mr. president how far do you go after london in move ahead in the integration of the u.s.s.r. into the international economy be there progress reach in this area to both president

 president gorbachev perhaps you can begin

 president bush well let i say that be a serious objective to start with secondly i believe that active participation in these international financial institution and the status that be deem well by the g 7 be the most important thing that the soviets can do right now i have free up as you hear today certain trade benefit or normalize the trade procedure that in my view will help and we have do that since the meeting in london

 but the answer be full participation full benefit of these international institution require full knowledge and step towards the privatization and toward convertability all the thing that i believe the soviet union want

 so work with the international organization and then bilaterally do what we have do and other country will be do too i be sure to remove the underbrush remove the barrier to bilateral economic cooperation so quite a bit have happen between we since paris and we look forward with our representative in these international organization to work very cooperatively with the soviet leader

 president gorbachev i understand that i be suppose to comment on this as well since the question be to both president i will be brief since i have already express my opinion about this london be the beginning of a very important process this be the meaning of the london meeting and one must judge about this in that light

 it be very important that after london there be a desire on both part to work out a mechanism which would permit the shifting of this cooperation give the political will of the leadership of the western country in the soviet union we think that we should have special structure which would keep tab of the cooperation between the soviet union and the g 7 country and first of all in the area of investment so the process would be easy in the taking of decision of mutual interest

 and it be good that the mechanism have start to be implement which we discuss in london and the minister of finances of england be already here we first talk about the fact that there would be visit of the minister of finance the secretary of the treasury of the u.s. and the representative of the frg so in other word there would be the mechanism of implement specific area of cooperation and this be very important that there be a mechanism for real interaction

 and finally the president mention that on the part of the u.s. an important decision will be take to make trade between our country easy i would say that i mention this in pass but we often discuss this with the president i ask and we agree to study the question of cocom restriction today because many billion dollar project which be ready to go and even sign be not be implement because of the fact that they have element that come under cocom restriction

 and therefore a very serious process have start and i think that this will continue and grow strong be more specific it will give result there be a will and a desire to do this it be very important

 nuclear weapons

 q. i would ask both of you to think back to the 1986 reykjavik summit when ronald reagan horrify quite a few american nuclear expert and almost all of the european leader by give serious consideration to your proposal president gorbachev for a ban on all nuclear weapon in the end reagan say no because of the belief that nuclear deterrence have in fact keep the peace at that time you have a massive conventional edge in europe though since then we have have the cfe treaty why now be the two of you not say we will now work towards a total nuclear ban do you still believe in the efficacy of nuclear deterrence in keep the peace particularly sir i ask you president bush give the fact that some of these breakaway republic they have nuclear weapon in there and who know what would happen if they declare independence

 president bush the very fact that i would not suggest that a breakaway republic be go to use a nuclear weapon against the united states but i would suggest that we have every reason in the world to be concern about renegade not in these area perhaps i hope not get hold of nuclear weapon and that be one of the reason i strongly support our gpal program that be be debate in the senate right now

 but in my view other country do possess nuclear weapon it be not just the soviet union and the united states and i do believe that we be on the right path by the path that president gorbachev have outline today on follow on exist agreement so rather than try to have a ethereal or a utopian answer let us follow through practically as he suggest and then as far as the u.s. be concern i would like we to go forward with a system that put nobody at threat nobody at risk the only thing at risk be an errant nuclear missile aim at a country and that be why i support the defensive approach and that be why i think one of the lesson out of the iraq war and maybe president gorbachev read this differently be that defense work and though we be talk about a different concept now an expand concept a more high tech concept i think a lot of life be save by defense so that be my reply

 president gorbachev i will say a few word i think that the argument which you want to ascribe to i that in my policy i look upon nuclear weapon as an element of deterrence be not true i have not say this yes we get involve in the arm race in a very serious way thank god as we say in russian that we stop this and turn it back and this be a great accomplishment since we understand where we be head

 but it be hard to resolve all these issue which have pile up and all these weapon that have pile up and i think that there be still a lot that we have to do we have map out a few thing for the future and then there will probably also be question put to all member of the nuclear club and they also have to think about what to do with nuclear weapon in the future

 and finally we must very carefully act about have the mechanism which we have create and which seem have work but apparently not effectively enough about nonproliferation of nuclear weapon this be one of the important topic of our conversation with the president during these day for if certain country will lower their arm and disarm and head in the direction of a nonnuclear world and at the same time other will find way to develop the process in order to have their own nuclear weapon then we will have a situation which be absurd

 so in continue to support nuclear disarmament and within the framework of the negotiation process which we have we have agree to continue this we have the question of truly improve the mechanism of nonproliferation nuclear technology in order missile technology in order to create an unsurmountable barrier in this area i think this be one of the most important thing we have to do today

 q. what significance do the process of european integration have in your conversation with the president for example the postwar unification of europe what image of this be the most acceptable to you from the point of view of the soviet union for example the image of a general de gaulle europe of fatherland country with decision be make on a national level or a united state of europe with common decision be make among they thank you

 europe

 president gorbachev first of all you can probably guess that everything that happen in europe in the world we have always look towards europe for everything that happen in europe in our area i do not want to list they have a great importance for the development in the world so undoubtedly the president and i note the positive development which be take place in europe and we note support of the document aim at create a new europe and we see that the soviet union and the u.s. must participate very actively in build a new europe all of this have exist and continue to exist and we feel a responsibility to do this

 but you ask the question about how i think perhaps you be a little hasty because when we be create a certain schematic and then try to impose it then we get one result when a process be be develop in a logical way within the helsinki process a political process of choice then we find that new form of cooperation and new institute come into being

 now i would say the following we must within the framework of the document the general path map out in the helsinki and the paris agreement act in such a way that the old institution be transform in the interest of a new europe so that they serve the interest of a single economic territory a single security of europe a legal aspect and so this be what we must aim for that mean when the old institution when they change we have to bear this in mind but apparently we will also have new institution which will arise which will serve this process

 and now if we have for example a common energy approach there will be mechanism of administer this and will have a great significance in the fate of europe and the process to realize this thus in go along this path without destroy the old institution in create new one we probably will find the form gradually to resolve these issue but if we declare a specific course but will keep the old structure institution without change they at all then again there can be a process of simply regroup of force in europe and there can be new confrontation which would come into be with a different distribution of force

 i be not in favor of this so i would more quickly go through the process of creation of new institution and would stimulate those tendency which would move we towards a united europe

 i do not think that here we need to have language vanish culture tradition vanish i think this would be a mistake if we set ourselves such a goal i think we should take into consideration those specific characteristic and tradition the history of the people but also aim for their unification i think this be compatible although we see that there be also an explosion of nationalism separatism effort to unravel everything this be a dangerous process i think that if we follow a path of chaotic development of such process then we will get into a bad situation

 so i be for the transformation of all institution i be for new institution which would act in the interest of unification process in europe

 mr. fitzwater we use our allotted time thank you very much



mr. speaker and mr. president distinguished member of congress honored guest and fellow citizen

 thank you very much for that warm reception you know with the big buildup this address have have i want to make sure it would be a big hit but i could not convince barbara to deliver it for i

 i see the speaker and the vice president be laugh they see what i do in japan and they be just happy they be sit behind i

 i mean to speak tonight of big thing of big change and the promise they hold and of some big problem and how together we can solve they and move our country forward as the undisputed leader of the age

 we gather tonight at a dramatic and deeply promising time in our history and in the history of man on earth for in the past 12 month the world have know change of almost biblical proportion and even now month after the fail coup that doom a fail system i be not sure we have absorb the full impact the full import of what happen but communism die this year

 even as president with the most fascinating possible vantage point there be time when i be so busy manage progress and help to lead change that i do not always show the joy that be in my heart but the big thing that have happen in the world in my life in our life be this by the grace of god america win the cold war

 i mean to speak this evening of the change that can take place in our country now that we can stop make the sacrifice we have to make when we have an avow enemy that be a superpower now we can look homeward even more and move to set right what need to be set right

 i will speak of those thing but let i tell you something i have be think these past few month it be a kind of rollcall of honor for the cold war do not end it be win and i think of those who win it in place like korea and vietnam and some of they do not come back back then they be hero but this year they be victor

 the long rollcall all the g.i. joes and janes all the one who fight faithfully for freedom who hit the ground and suck the dust and know their share of horror this may seem frivolous and i do not mean it so but it be move to i how the world see they the world see not only their special valor but their special style their rambunctious optimistic bravery their do or die unity unhampere by class or race or region what a group we have put forth for generation now from the one who write kilroy be here on the wall of the german stalag to those who leave sign in the iraqi desert that say i see elvis what a group of kid we have send out into the world

 and there be another to be single out though it may seem inelegant and i mean a mass of people call the american taxpayer no one ever think to thank the people who pay a country 's bill or an alliance 's bill but for half a century now the american people have shoulder the burden and pay taxis that be high than they would have be to support a defense that be big than it would have be if imperial communism have never exist but it do do not anymore and here be a fact i would not mind the world acknowledge the american taxpayer bear the brunt of the burden and deserve a hunk of the glory

 so now for the first time in 35 year our strategic bomber stand down no long be they on round the clock alert tomorrow our child will go to school and study history and how plant grow and they will not have as my child do air raid drill in which they crawl under their desk and cover their head in case of nuclear war my grandchild do not have to do that and will not have the bad dream child have once in decade past there be still threat but the long draw out dread be over

 a year ago tonight i speak to you at a moment of high peril american force have just unleash operation desert storm and after 40 day in the desert sky and four day on the ground the man and woman of america 's armed force and our ally accomplish the goal that i declare and that you endorse we liberate kuwait soon after the arab world and israel sit down to talk seriously and comprehensively about peace an historic first and soon after that at christmas the last american hostage come home our policy be vindicate

 much good can come from the prudent use of power and much good can come of this a world once divide into two armed camp now recognize one sole and preeminent power the united states of america and they regard this with no dread for the world trust we with power and the world be right they trust we to be fair and restrained they trust we to be on the side of decency they trust we to do what be right

 i use those word advisedly a few day after the war begin i receive a telegram from joanne speicher the wife of the first pilot kill in the gulf lieutenant commander scott speicher even in her grief she want i to know that some day when her child be old enough she would tell they that their father go away to war because it be the right thing to do and she say it all it be the right thing to do

 and we do it together there be honest difference right here in this chamber but when the war begin you put partisanship aside and we support our troop this be still a time for pride but this be no time to boast for problem face we and we must stand together once again and solve they and not let our country down

 two year ago i begin plan cut in military spending that reflect the change of the new era but now this year with imperial communism go that process can be accelerate tonight i can tell you of dramatic change in our strategic nuclear force these be action we be take on our own because they be the right thing to do after complete 20 plane for which we have begin procurement we will shut down further production of the b-2 bomber we will cancel the small icbm program we will cease production of new warhead for our sea base ballistic missile we will stop all new production of the peacekeeper missile and we will not purchase any more advanced cruise missile

 this weekend i will meet at camp david with boris yeltsin of the russian federation i have inform president yeltsin that if the commonwealth the former soviet union will eliminate all land base multiple warhead ballistic missile i will do the following we will eliminate all peacekeeper missile we will reduce the number of warhead on minuteman missile to one and reduce the number of warhead on our sea base missile by about one third and we will convert a substantial portion of our strategic bomber to primarily conventional use president yeltsin 's early response have be very positive and i expect our talk at camp david to be fruitful

 i want you to know that for half a century american president have long to make such decision and say such word but even in the midst of celebration we must keep caution as a friend for the world be still a dangerous place only the dead have see the end of conflict and though yesterday 's challenge be behind we tomorrow 's be be bear

 the secretary of defense recommend these cut after consultation with the joint chiefs of staff and i make they with confidence but do not misunderstand i the reduction i have approve will save we an additional $ 50 billion over the next five year by 1997 we will have cut defense by 30 percent since i take office these cut be deep and you must know my resolve this deep and no deep to do less would be insensible to progress but to do more would be ignorant of history we must not go back to the day of the hollow army we can not repeat the mistake make twice in this century when armistice be follow by recklessness and defense be purge as if the world be permanently safe

 i remind you this evening that i have ask for your support in fund a program to protect our country from limited nuclear missile attack we must have this protection because too many people in too many country have access to nuclear arm and i urge you again to pass the strategic defense initiative sdi

 there be those who say that now we can turn away from the world that we have no special role no special place but we be the united states of america the leader of the west that have become the leader of the world and as long as i be president i will continue to lead in support of freedom everywhere not out of arrogance not out of altruism but for the safety and security of our child this be a fact strength in the pursuit of peace be no vice isolationism in the pursuit of security be no virtue

 and now to our trouble at home they be not all economic the primary problem be our economy there be some good sign inflation that thief be down and interest rate be down but unemployment be too high some industry be in trouble and growth be not what it should be let i tell you right from the start and right from the heart i know we be in hard time but i know something else this will not stand

 in this chamber in this chamber we can bring the same courage and sense of common purpose to the economy that we bring to desert storm and we can defeat hard time together i believe you will help one reason be that you be patriot and you want the good for your country and i believe that in your heart you want to put partisanship aside and get the job do because it be the right thing to do

 the power of america rest in a stirring but simple idea that people will do great thing if only you set they free well we be go to set the economy free for if this age of miracle and wonder have teach we anything it be that if we can change the world we can change america we must encourage investment we must make it easy for people to invest money and create new product new industry and new job we must clear away the obstacle to growth high taxis high regulation redtape and yes wasteful government spending

 none of this will happen with a snap of the finger but it will happen and the test of a plan be not whether it be call new or dazzling the american people be not impress by gimmick they be smart on this score than all of we in this room the only test of a plan be be it sound and will it work

 we must have a short term plan to address our immediate need and heat up the economy and then we need a long term plan to keep combustion go and to guarantee our place in the world economy there be certain thing that a president can do without congress and i be go to do they

 i have this evening ask major cabinet department and federal agency to institute a 90 day moratorium on any new federal regulation that could hinder growth in those 90 day major department and agency will carry out a top to bottom review of all regulation old and new to stop the one that will hurt growth and speed up those that will help growth

 far for the untold number of hard work responsible american worker and business man and woman who have be force to go without needed bank loan the banking credit crunch must end i will not neglect my responsibility for sound regulation that serve the public good but regulatory overkill must be stop and i have instruct our government regulator to stop it

 i have direct cabinet department and federal agency to speed up progrowth expenditure as quickly as possible this should put an extra $ 10 billion into the economy in the next six month and our new transportation bill provide more than $ 150 billion for construction and maintenance project that be vital to our growth and well being and that mean job build road job build bridge and job build railway

 and i have this evening direct the secretary of the treasury to change the federal tax withholding table with this change million of americans from whom the government withhold more than necessary can now choose to have the government withhold less from their paycheck something tell i a number of taxpayer may take we up on this one this initiative could return about $ 25 billion back into our economy over the next 12 month money people can use to help pay for clothing college or to get a new car finally work with the federal reserve we will continue to support monetary policy that keep both interest rate and inflation down

 now these be the thing i can do and now member of congress let i tell you what you can do for your country you must pass the other element of my plan to meet our economic need everyone know that investment spur recovery i be propose this evening a change in the alternative minimum tax and the creation of a new 15 percent investment tax allowance this will encourage business to accelerate investment and bring people back to work

 real estate have lead our economy out of almost all the tough time we have ever have once building start carpenter and plumber work people buy home and take out mortgage my plan would modify the passive loss rule for active real estate developer and it would make it easy for pension plan to purchase real estate for those americans who dream of buy a first home but who can not quite afford it my plan would allow first time homebuyer to withdraw saving from ira without penalty and provide a $ 5,000 tax credit for the first purchase of that home

 and finally my immediate plan call on congress to give crucial help to people who own a home to everyone who have a business or a farm or a single investment this time at this hour i can not take no for an answer you must cut the capital gain tax on the people of our country never have an issue be more demagogue by its opponent but the demagog be wrong they be wrong and they know it sixty percent of the people who benefit from low capital gain have income under $ 50,000 a cut in the capital gain tax increase job and help just about everyone in our country and so i be ask you to cut the capital gain tax to a maximum of 15.4 percent

 i will tell you those of you who say oh no someone who be comfortable may benefit from that you kind of remind i of the old definition of the puritan who could not sleep at night worry that somehow someone somewhere be out have a good time laughter the opponent of this measure and those who have author various so call soak the rich bill that be float around this chamber should be remind of something when they aim at the big guy they usually hit the little guy and maybe it be time that stop

 this then be my short term plan your part member of congress require enactment of these commonsense proposal that will have a strong effect on the economy without break the budget agreement and without raise tax rate

 while my plan be be pass and kick in we have get to care for those in trouble today i have provide for up to $ 4.4 billion in my budget to extend federal unemployment benefit and i ask for congressional action right away and i thank the committee applause well at last

 let us be frank let us be frank let i level with you i know and you know that my plan be unveil in a political season laughter i know and you know that everything i propose will be view by some in merely partisan term but i ask you to know what be in my heart and my aim be to increase our nation 's good i be do what i think be right and i be propose what i know will help

 i pride myself that i be a prudent man and i believe that patience be a virtue but i understand that politic be for some a game and that sometimes the game be to stop all progress and then decry the lack of improvement laughter but let i tell you far more important than my political future and far more important than yours be the well being of our country member of this chamber be practical people and i know you will not resent some practical advice when people put their party 's fortune whatever the party whatever side of this aisle before the public good they court defeat not only for their country but for themselves and they will certainly deserve it

 i submit my plan tomorrow and i be ask you to pass it by march 20 and i ask the american people to let you know they want this action by march 20 from the day after that if it must be the battle be join and you know when principle be at stake i relish a good fair fight

 i say my plan have two part and it do and it be the second part that be the heart of the matter for it be not enough to get an immediate burst we need long term improvement in our economic position we all know that the key to our economic future be to ensure that america continue as an economic leader of the world we have that in our power here then be my long term plan to guarantee our future

 first trade we will work to break down the wall that stop world trade we will work to open market everywhere and in our major trade negotiation i will continue push to eliminate tariff and subsidy that damage america 's farmer and worker and we will get more good american job within our own hemisphere through the north american free trade agreement and through the enterprise for the americas initiative

 but change be here and more be come the workplace of the future will demand more highly skilled worker than ever more people who be computer literate highly educated we must be the world 's leader in education and we must revolutionize america 's school my america 2000 strategy will help we reach that goal my plan will give parent more choice give teacher more flexibility and help community create new american school thirty state across the nation have establish america 2000 program hundred of city and town have join in now congress must join this great movement pass my proposal for new american school

 that be my second long term proposal and here be my third we must make commonsense investment that will help we compete long term in the marketplace we must encourage research and development my plan be to make the r&amp;d tax credit permanent and to provide record level of support over $ 76 billion this year alone for people who will explore the promise of emerge technology

 fourth we must do something about crime and drug it be time for a major renew investment in fight violent street crime it sap our strength and hurt our faith in our society and in our future together surely a tired woman on her way to work at 6 in the morning on a subway deserve the right to get there safely and surely it be true that everyone who change his or her life because of crime from those afraid to go out at night to those afraid to walk in the park they pay for surely these people have be deny a basic civil right it be time to restore it congress pass my comprehensive crime bill it be tough on criminal and supportive of police and it have be languish in these hallowed hall for year now pass it help your country

 fifth i ask you tonight to fund our hope housing proposal and to pass my enterprise zone legislation which will get business into the inner city we must empower the poor with the pride that come from own a home get a job become a part of thing my plan would encourage real estate construction by extend tax incentive for mortgage revenue bond and low income housing and i ask tonight for record expenditure for the program that help child bear into want move into excellence head start

 step six we must reform our health care system for this too bear on whether or not we can compete in the world american health cost have be explode this year america will spend over $ 800 billion on health and that be expect to grow to $ 1.6 trillion by the end of the decade we simply can not afford this the cost of health care show up not only in your family budget but in the price of everything we buy and everything we sell when health coverage for a fellow on an assembly line cost thousand of dollar the cost go into the product he make and you pay the bill

 we must make a choice now some pretend we can have it both way they call it play or pay but that expensive approach be unstable it will mean high taxis few job and eventually a system under complete government control

 really there be only two option and we can move toward a nationalize system a system which will restrict patient choice in pick a doctor and force the government to ration service arbitrarily and what we will get be patient in long line indifferent service and a huge new tax burden or we can reform our own private health care system which still give we for all its flaw the good quality health care in the world

 well let us build on our strength my plan provide insurance security for all americans while preserve and increase the idea of choice we make basic health insurance affordable for all low income people not now cover and we do it by provide a health insurance tax credit of up to $ 3,750 for each low income family and the middle class get help too and by reform the health insurance market my plan assure that americans will have access to basic health insurance even if they change job or develop serious health problem we must bring cost under control preserve quality preserve choice and reduce the people 's nagging daily worry about health insurance my plan the detail of which i will announce very shortly do just that

 seventh we must get the federal deficit under control we now have in law enforceable spending cap and a requirement that we pay for the program we create there be those in congress who would ease that discipline now but i can not let they do it and i will not

 my plan would freeze all domestic discretionary budget authority which mean no more next year than this year i will not tamper with social security but i would put real cap on the growth of uncontrolled spending and i would also freeze federal domestic government employment and with the help of congress my plan will get rid of 246 program that do not deserve federal funding some of they have noble title but none of they be indispensable we can get rid of each and every one of they

 you know it be time we rediscover a home truth the american people have never forget this government be too big and spend too much and i call upon congress to adopt a measure that will help put an end to the annual ritual of fill the budget with pork barrel appropriation every year the press have a field day make fun of outrageous example a lawrence welk museum research grant for belgian endive we all know how these thing get into the budget and maybe you need someone to help you say no i know how to say it and i know what i need to make it stick give i the same thing 43 governor have the line item veto and let i help you control spending

 we must put an end to unfinanced federal government mandate these be the requirement congress put on our city county and state without supply the money if congress pass a mandate it should be force to pay for it and balance the cost with saving elsewhere after all a mandate just increase someone else 's burden and that mean high taxis at the state and local level

 step eight congress should enact the bold reform proposal that be still await congressional action bank reform civil justice reform tort reform and my national energy strategy

 and finally we must strengthen the family because it be the family that have the great bearing on our future when barbara hold an aids baby in her arm and read to child she be say to every person in this country family matter

 and i be announce tonight a new commission on america 's urban families i have ask missouri 's governor john ashcroft to be chairman former dallas mayor annette strauss to be cochair you know i have mayor the lead mayor from the league of cities in the other day at the white house and they tell i something striking they say that every one of they republican or democrat agree on one thing that the major cause of the problem of the city be the dissolution of the family they ask for this commission and they be right to ask because it be time to determine what we can do to keep family together strong and sound

 there be one thing we can do right away ease the burden of rear a child i ask you tonight to raise the personal exemption by $ 500 per child for every family for a family with four kid that be an increase of $ 2,000 this be a good start in the right direction and it be what we can afford

 it be time to allow family to deduct the interest they pay on student loan i be ask you to do just that and i be ask you to allow people to use money from their ira to pay medical and education expense all without penalty

 and i be ask for more ask american parent what they dislike about how thing be go in our country and chance be good that pretty soon they will get to welfare americans be the most generous people on earth but we have to go back to the insight of franklin roosevelt who when he speak of what become the welfare program warn that it must not become a narcotic and a subtle destroyer of the spirit welfare be never mean to be a lifestyle it be never mean to be a habit it be never suppose to be pass from generation to generation like a legacy it be time to replace the assumption of the welfare state and help reform the welfare system

 state throughout the country be begin to operate with new assumption that when able body people receive government assistance they have responsibility to the taxpayer a responsibility to seek work education or job training a responsibility to get their life in order a responsibility to hold their family together and refrain from have child out of wedlock and a responsibility to obey the law we be go to help this movement often state reform require waive certain federal regulation i will act to make that process easy and quick for every state that ask for our help

 i want to add as we make these change we work together to improve this system that our intention be not scapegoate or finger pointing if you read the paper and watch tv you know there be be a rise these day in a certain kind of ugliness racist comment anti semitism an increase sense of division really this be not we this be not who we be and this be not acceptable

 and so you have my plan for america and i be ask for big thing but i believe in my heart you will do what be right

 you know it be kind of an american tradition to show a certain skepticism toward our democratic institution i myself have sometimes think the age process could be delay if it have to make its way through congress laughter you will deliberate and you will discuss and that be fine but my friend the people can not wait they need help now

 there be a mood among we people be worried there be be talk of decline someone even say our worker be lazy and uninspired and i think really you go tell neil armstrong stand on the moon tell the man and woman who put he there tell the american farmer who feed his country and the world tell the man and woman of desert storm

 moods come and go but greatness endure our do and maybe for a moment it be good to remember what in the dailiness of our life we forget we be still and ever the free nation on earth the kind nation on earth the strong nation on earth and we have always rise to the occasion and we be go to lift this nation out of hard time inch by inch and day by day and those who would stop we have well step aside because i look at hard time and i make this vow this will not stand

 and so we move on together a rise nation the once and future miracle that be still this night the hope of the world thank you god bless you and god bless our beloved country thank you very very much



thank you all very much thank you thank you very much and i be proud to receive and i be honor to accept your nomination for president of the united states

 may i thank my dear friend and our great leader bob dole for that wonderful introduction

 let i say this this nomination be not for i alone it be for the idea principle and value that we stand for

 my job have be make easy by a leader who be take a lot of unfair criticism with grace and humor the vice president of the united states dan quayle and i be very grateful to he

 i want to talk tonight about the sharp choice that i intend to offer americans this fall a choice between different agenda different direction and yes a choice about the character of the man you want to lead this nation i know that americans have many question about our economy about our country 's future even question about i i will answer they tonight

 first i feel great and i be hearten by the poll the one that say that i look well in my jogging short than the governor of arkansas

 four year ago i speak about mission for my life and for our country i speak of one urgent mission defend our security and promote the american ideal abroad

 just pause for a moment to reflect on what we have do germany be united and a slab of the berlin wall sit right outside this astrodome arabs and israelis now sit face to face and talk peace and every hostage hold in lebanon be free the conflict in el salvador be over and free election bring democracy to nicaragua black and white south africans cheer each other at the olympics the soviet union can only be find in history book the captive nation of eastern europe and the baltics be captive no more and today on the rural street of poland merchant sell can of air label ` ` the last breath of communism

 if i have stand before you 4 year ago and describe this as the world we would help to build you would have say ` ` george bush you must have be smoke something and you must have inhale

 this convention be the first at which an american president can say the cold war be over and freedom finish first

 audience member u.s.a. u.s.a. u.s.a.

 the president we have a lot to be proud of a lot some want to rewrite history want to skip over the struggle claim the outcome be inevitable and while the u.s. postwar strategy be largely bipartisan the fact remain that the liberal mcgovern wing of the other party include my opponent consistently make the wrong choice in the seventy they want a hollow army we want a strong fighting force in the eighty and you remember this one in the eighty they want a nuclear freeze and we insist on peace through strength from angola to central america they say ` ` let us negotiate deliberate procrastinate we say ` ` just stand up for freedom now the cold war be over and they claim ` ` hey we be with you all the way

 audience member boo o o

 the president you know their behavior remind i of the old con man 's advice to the new kid he say ` ` son if you be be run out of town just get out in front and make it look like a parade

 well make no mistake the demise of communism be not a sure thing it take the strong leadership of president from both party include republicans like richard nixon and gerald ford and ronald reagan without their vision and the support of the american people the soviet union would be a strong superpower today and we would be face a nuclear threat tonight

 my opponent say i spend too much time on foreign policy as if it do not matter that schoolchildren once hide under their desk in drill to prepare for nuclear war i see the chance to rid our child 's dream of the nuclear nightmare and i do over the past 4 year more people have breathe the fresh air of freedom than in all of human history i see a chance to help and i do these be the two define opportunity not of a year not of a decade but of an entire span of human history i seize those opportunity for our kid and our grandkid and i make no apology for that

 now the soviet bear may be go but there be still wolf in the wood we see that when saddam hussein invade kuwait the mideast might have become a nuclear powder keg our energy supply hold hostage so we do what be right and what be necessary we destroy a threat free a people and lock a tyrant in the prison of his own country

 what about the leader of the arkansas national guard the man who hope to be commander in chief well i bite the bullet and he bite his nail listen to this now two day after congress follow my lead my opponent say this and i quote directly ` ` i guess i would have vote with the majority if it be a close vote but i agree with the argument the minority make now sound to i like his policy can be sum up by a road sign he be probably see on his bus tour ` ` slippery when wet

 look this be serious business think about the impact of our foreign policy failure the last time the democrats control both end of pennsylvania avenue gas line grain embargo american hostage blindfold

 there will be more foreign policy challenge like kuwait in the next 4 year terrorist and aggressor to stand up to dangerous weapon to be control and destroy freedom 's fight be not finish i look forward to be the first president to visit a free democratic cuba who will lead the world in the face of these challenge not my opponent in his acceptance speech he devote just 65 second to tell we about the world

 then he say that america be and i quote again i want to be fair and factual i quote be ` ` ridicule everywhere well tell that to the people around the world for whom america be still a dream tell that to leader around the world from whom america command respect ridicule tell that to the man and woman of desert storm

 audience member u.s.a. u.s.a. u.s.a.

 the president let i just make an aside comment here because of what you have be read in the paper this be a political year but there be a lot of danger in the world you can be sure i will never let politic interfere with a foreign policy decision forget the election i will do right what be right for the national security of the united states of america and that be a pledge from my heart

 fifty year ago this summer i be 18 year of age i see some young people in the audience tonight and i remember how i feel in those day i believe deeply in this country and we be face with a world war so i make a decision to go off and fight a battle much different from political battle

 i be scared but i be willing i be young but i be ready i have barely live when i begin to watch man die i begin to see the special place of america in the world i begin to see even then that the world would become a much small place and faraway place could become more and more like america

 fifty year later after change of almost biblical proportion we know that when freedom grow america grow just as a strong america mean a safe world we have learn that a safe world mean a strong america

 this election be about change but that be not unusual because the american revolution be never end today the pace of change be accelerate we face new opportunity and new challenge the question be who do you trust to make change work for you

 audience member george bush george bush george bush

 the president my opponent say america be a nation in decline of our economy he say we be somewhere on the list beneath germany head south toward sri lanka well do not let anyone tell you that america be second rate especially somebody run for president

 maybe he have not hear that we be still the world 's large economy no other nation sell more outside its border the germans the british the japanese can not touch the productivity of you the american worker and the american farmer my opponent will not mention that he will not remind you that interest rate be the low they have be in 20 year and million of americans have refinance their home you just will not hear that inflation the thief of the middle class have be lock in a maximum security prison

 you do not hear much about this good news because the medium also tend to focus only on the bad when the berlin wall fall i half expect to see a headline ` ` wall falls three border guards lose jobs laughter and underneath it probably say ` ` clinton blames bush laughter

 you do not hear a lot about progress in america so let i tell you about some good thing we have do together

 just two week ago all three nation of north america agree to trade freely from manitoba to mexico this will bring good job to main street u.s.a.

 we pass the americans with disabilities act bring 43 million people into the economic mainstream i must say it be about time

 our child will breathe easy because of our new clean air pact

 we be rebuild our road provide job for more than half a million americans

 we pass a child care law and we take a stand for family value by say that when it come to raise child government do not know well parent know well

 i have fight against prejudice and anti semitism all my life i be proud that we strengthen our civil right law and we do it without resort to quota

 one more thing of vital importance to all today cocaine use have fall by 60 percent among young people to the teenager the parent and the volunteer who be help we battle the scourge of drug in america we say thank you thank you from the bottom of our heart

 do i want to do more you bet nothing hurt i more than to meet with soldier home from the persian gulf who can not find a job or worker who have a job but worry that the next day will bring a pink slip and what about parent who scrape and struggle to send their kid to college only to find they back live at home because they can not get work

 the world be in transition and we be feel that transition in our home the defining challenge of the ninety be to win the economic competition to win the peace we must be a military superpower an economic superpower and an export superpower

 in this election you will hear two version of how to do this theirs be to look inward and protect what we already have ours be to look forward to open new market prepare our people to compete to restore our social fabric to save and invest so we can win

 we believe that now that the world look more like america it be time for america to look more like herself and so we offer a philosophy that put faith in the individual not the bureaucracy a philosophy that empower people to do their good so america can be at its good in a world that be safe and free this be how we will build an america that be strong safe and more secure

 we start with a simple fact government be too big and spend too much

 i have ask congress to put a lid on mandatory spending except social security i have propose do away with over 200 program and 4,000 wasteful project and to freeze all other spending

 the gridlock democrat congress say no

 audience member boo o o

 the president so begin tonight i will enforce the spending freeze on my own if congress send i a bill spend more than i ask for in my budget i will veto it fast veto it fast fast than copy of millie 's book sell

 now congress will not cut spending but refuse to give the president the power to eliminate pork barrel project that waste your money forty three governors have that power so i ask you the american people give i a congress that will give i the line item veto

 let i tell you about a recent battle fight with the congress a battle in which i be aid by bob michel and his troop and bob dole and his this spring i work day and night to get two third of the house members to approve a balanced budget amendment to the constitution we almost have it but we lose by just nine vote now listen how just before the vote the liberal leader of the congress convince 12 member who cosponsor the bill to switch side and vote no keep in mind they vote against a bill they have already put their name on something fishy be go on

 and look at my opponent on this issue look at my opponent he say he be for balanced budget but he come out against the amendment he be like that on a lot of issue first on one side then the other he be be spot in more place than elvis presley

 after all these year congress have become pretty creative at find way to waste your money so we need to be just as creative at find way to stop they i have a brandnew idea taxpayer should be give the right to check a box on their tax return so that up to 10 percent of their payment can go for one purpose alone to reduce the national debt

 but we also need to make sure that congress do not just turn around and borrow more money to spend more money so i will require that for every tax dollar set aside to cut the debt the ceiling on spending will be cut by an equal amount that way we will cut both debt and spending and take a whack out of the budget deficit

 my feeling about big government come from my experience i spend half my adult life in the private sector my opponent have a different experience he be be in government nearly all his life his passion to expand government know no bound

 he be already propose and listen to this carefully he have already propose $ 220 billion in new spending along with the big tax increase in history $ 150 billion and that be just to start

 audience member boo o o

 the president he say he want to tax the rich but folk he define rich as anyone who have a job laughter

 you have hear of the separation of power well my opponent practice a different theory the power of separation government have the power to separate you from your wallet laughter

 now let i say this when it come to taxis i have learn the hard way there be an old saying ` ` good judgment come from experience and experience come from bad judgment two year ago i make a bad call on the democrats tax increase i underestimate congress addiction to taxis with my back against the wall i agree to a hard bargain one tax increase one time in return for the tough spending limit ever

 well it be a mistake to go along with the democratic tax increase and i admit it but here be the question for the american people who do you trust in this election the candidate who be raise taxis one time and regret it or the other candidate who raise taxis and fee 128 time and enjoy it every time

 audience member viva bush viva bush viva bush

 the president thank you very much

 audience member hit them again hit them again hard hard hit them again hit them again hard hard

 the president when the new congress convene next january i will propose to far reduce taxis across the board provide we pay for these cut with specific spending reduction that i consider appropriate so that we do not increase the deficit i will also continue to fight to increase the personal exemption and to create job by win a cut in capital gain taxis

 that will especially help small business you know they create small business they create two third of the new job in america but my opponent 's plan for small business be clear present and dangerous beside new income taxis his plan will lead to a new payroll tax to pay for a government takeover of health care and another new tax to pay for training that be just the beginning

 if he get his way hardware store across america will have a new sign up ` ` close for despair i guess you would say his plan really be ` ` elvis economic america will be check into the ` ` heartbreak hotel

 i believe that small business need relief from taxation regulation and litigation and thus i will extend for one year the freeze on paperwork and unnecessary federal regulation that i impose last winter there be no reason that federal regulation should live long than my friend george burns i will issue an order to get rid of any rule whose time have come and go

 i see something happen in our town and in our neighborhood sharp lawyer be run wild doctor be afraid to practice medicine and some mom and pop will not even coach little league any more we must sue each other less and care for each other more i be fight to reform our legal system to put an end to crazy lawsuit if that mean climb into the ring with the trial lawyer well let i just say round one start tonight

 after all my opponent 's campaign be be back by practically every trial lawyer who ever wear a tasselled loafer he be not in the ring with they he be in the tank

 there be other thing we need to do to get our economy up to speed prepare our kid for the next century we must have new incentive for research and new training for worker small business need capital and credit and defense worker need new job i have a plan to provide affordable health care for every american control cost by cut paperwork and lawsuit and expand coverage to the poor of the poor

 we do not need my opponent 's plan for a massive government takeover of health care which would ration care and deny you the right to choose a doctor who want health care with a system with the efficiency of the house post office and the compassion of the kgb

 what about our school what about our school my opponent and i both want to change the way our kid learn he want to change our school a little bit and i want to change they a lot take the issue of whether parent should be able to choose the good school for their kid my opponent say that be okay as long as the school be run by government and i say every parent and child should have a real choice of school public private or religious

 so we have a clear choice to fix our problem do we turn to the tattered blanket of bureaucracy that other nation be toss away or do we give our people the freedom and incentive to build security for themselves

 here be what i be fight for open market for american product low government spending tax relief opportunity for small business legal and health reform job training and new school build on competition ready for the 21st century

 now okay why be these proposal not in effect today only one reason the gridlock democratic congress

 audience member clean your house clean your house clean your house

 the president a very good idea a very good idea

 now i know americans be tired of the blame game tired of people in washington act like they be candidate for the next episode of ` ` american gladiators i do not like it either neither should you but the truth be the truth our policy have not fail they have not even be try

 americans want job and on january 28th i put before congress a plan to create job if it have be pass back then 500,000 more americans would be at work right now but in a nation that demand action congress have become the master of inaction

 it be not always this way i hear president ford tonight i serve in congress 22 year ago under he and back then we cooperate we do not get personal we put the people above everything else heck we do not even own blow dryer back in those day

 at my first inauguration i say that people do not send we to bicker i extend my hand and i think the american people know this i extend my hand to the congressional leader the democratic leader and they bite it

 the house leadership have not change in 38 year it be a body catch in a hopelessly tangle web of pac 's perk privilege partnership and paralysis every day congress put politic ahead of principle and above progress

 now let i give you just one example february 20th 1991 it be at the height of the gulf war on that very same day i ask american pilot to risk their life to fly mission over baghdad i also want to strengthen our economic security for the future so that very same day i introduce a new domestic energy strategy which would cut our dependence on foreign oil by 7 million barrel a day

 how many day do it take to win the gulf war forty three how many do it take congress to pass a national energy strategy five hundred and thirty two and still count i have ride stationary bike that can move fast than the united states house of representatives and the united states senate control by the democrat leadership

 audience member hit them again hit them again hard hard hit them again hit them again hard hard

 the president okay all right you wait i be fix to

 where do my opponent stand with congress well up in new york at their convention they keep the congressional leader away from the podium hide they away they do not want america to hear from the people who really make the decision they hide they for a very good reason because the american people would recognize a dangerous combination a rubber check congress and a rubber stamp president

 governor clinton and congress know that you have catch on to their lingo they know when they say ` ` spending you say ` ` uh oh so now they have a new word ` ` investment they want to ` ` invest $ 220 billion more of your money but i want you to keep it

 governor clinton and congress want to put through the large tax increase in history but i will not let that happen governor clinton and congress do not want kid to have the option of pray in school but i do clinton and congress do not want to close legal loophole and keep criminal behind bar but i will clinton and congress will stock the judiciary with liberal judge who write law they can not get approve by the voter

 governor clinton even say that mario cuomo belong on the supreme court laughter wait a minute though no wait maybe not a bad idea if you believe in judicial restraint you probably ought to be happy after all the good governor of new york can not make up his mind between chocolate and vanilla at baskin robbins he be there we will not have another court decision for 35 year and maybe that be all right too

 be my opponent and congress really in cahoot look at one important question should we limit the term of congress

 audience member yes

 the president governor clinton say no congress say no i say yes

 we try this look we try this once before combine the democratic governor of a small southern state with a very liberal vice president and a democratic congress america do not need carter ii we do not want to take america back to those day of malaise but americans want to know where 's proof that we will have well day in washington

 i will give you 150 reason that be how many member of congress be expect to leave washington this year some be taint by scandal the voter have bounce they the way they bounce their own check but other be good member republican and democrat and they agree with i the place just do not work anymore

 one hundred fifty new member from both party will be come to washington this fall every one will have a fresh view of america 's future

 i pledge today to the american people immediately after this election i will meet with every one of these member before they get attack by the pac 's overwhelmed by their staff and corner by some camera crew i will lay out my case for change change that matter real change that make a difference change that be right for america

 you see there be a yearning in america a feeling that maybe it be time to get back to our root sure we must change but some value be timeless i believe in family that stick together father who stick around i happen to believe very deeply in the worth of each individual human being bear or unborn i believe in teach our kid the difference between what be wrong and what be right teach they respect for hard work and to love their neighbor i believe that america will always have a special place in god 's heart as long as he have a special place in ours maybe that be why i have always believe that patriotism be not just another point of view

 there be time in every young person 's life when god introduce you to yourself i remember such a time it be back many year ago when i stand watch at 4 a.m. up on the bridge of a submarine the united states finback u.s.s. finback and i would stand there and look out on the blackness of the sky break only by the sparkle star above and i would think about friend i lose a country i love and about a girl name barbara i remember those night as clearly as any in my life

 you know you can see thing from up there that other people do not see you can see storm cloud rise and then disappear the first hint of the sun over the horizon and the first outline of the shore far away

 now i know that americans be uneasy today there be anxious talk around our kitchen table but from where i stand i see not america 's sunset but a sunrise

 the world change for which we have sacrifice for a generation have finally come to pass and with they a rare and unprecedented opportunity to pass the sweet cup of prosperity around our american table

 be we up to it i know we be as i travel our land i meet veteran who once work the turret of a tank and can now master the keyboard of high tech economy i see teacher bless with the incredible american capacity for innovation who be teach our child a new way to learn for a new century i meet parent some work two job with hectic schedule who still find new way to teach old value to steady their kid in a turbulent world

 i take heart from what be happen in america not from those who profess a new passion for government but from those with an old and endure faith in the human potential those who understand that the genius of america be our capacity for rebirth and renewal america be the land where the sun be always peek over the horizon

 tonight i appeal to that unyielding undying undeniable american spirit i ask you to consider now that the entire world be move our way why would we want to go back their way i ask not just for your support for my agenda but for your commitment to renew and rebuild our nation by shake up the one institution that have withstand change for over four decade join i in roll away the roadblock at the other end of pennsylvania avenue so that in the next 4 year we will match our accomplishment outside by build a strong safe more secure america inside

 forty four year ago in another age of uncertainty a different president embark on a similar mission his name be harry s truman as he stand before his party to accept their nomination harry truman know the freedom i know this evening the freedom to talk about what be right for america and let the chip fall where they may

 harry truman say this this be more than a political call to arm give i your help not to win vote alone but to win this new crusade and keep america safe and secure for its own people

 each candidate will have up to 2 minute for a closing statement the order of those as well as the questioning be determine by a drawing the first question go to mr. perot he will have 2 minute to answer to be follow by rebuttal of one minute each from governor clinton and then president bush

 distinction among candidates

 gentlemen good evening the first topic tonight be what separate each of you from the other mr. perot what do you believe tonight be the single most important separate issue of this campaign

 mr. perot i think the principal issue that separate i be that 5 1/2 million people come together on their own and put i on the ballot i be not put on the ballot by either of the two party i be not put on the ballot by any pac money by any foreign lobbyist money by any special interest money this be a movement that come from the people

 this be the way the framer of the constitution intend our government to be a government that come from the people over time we have develop a government that come at the people that come from the top down where the people be more or less treat as object to be program during the campaign with commercial and medium event and fear message and personal attack and thing of that nature

 the thing that separate my candidacy and make it unique be that this come from million of people in 50 state all over this country who want a candidate that work and belong to nobody but they i go into this race as their servant and i belong to they so this come from the people

 mr. lehrer governor clinton one minute response

 governor clinton the most important distinction in this campaign be that i represent real hope for change a departure from trickle down economic a departure from tax and spend economic to invest and grow but before i can do that i must challenge the american people to change and they must decide

 tonight i say to the president mr. bush for 12 year you have have it your way you have have your chance and it do not work it be time to change i want to bring that change to the american people but we must all decide first we have the courage to change for hope and a well tomorrow

 mr. lehrer president bush one minute response sir

 president bush well i think one thing that distinguish be experience i think we have dramatically change the world i will talk about that a little bit later but the change be mind boggle for world peace kid go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war and change for change 's sake be not enough we see that message in the late seventy when we hear a lot about change and what happen that misery index go right through the roof

 but my economic program i think be the kind of change we want and the way we be go to get it do be we be go to have a brandnew congress a lot of they be throw out because of all the scandal i will sit down with they democrats and republicans alike and work for my agenda for american renewal which represent real change

 but i would say if you have to separate out i think it be experience at this level

 experience

 mr. lehrer governor clinton how do you respond to the president you have 2 minute on the question of experience he say that be what distinguish he from the other two of you

 governor clinton i believe experience count but it be not everything value judgment and the record that i have amass in my state also should count for something i have work hard to create good job and to educate people my state now rank first in the country in job growth this year fourth in income growth fourth in the reduction of poverty third in overall economic performance accord to a major news magazine that be because we believe in invest in education and in job

 we have to change in this country you know my wife hillary give i a book about a year ago in which the author define insanity as just do the same old thing over and over again and expect a different result we have get to have the courage to change experience be important yes i have get a lot of good experience in deal with ordinary people over the last year and a month i have touch more people 's life and see more heartbreak and hope more pain and more promise than anybody else who be run for president this year and i think the american people deserve well than they be get we have go from first to 13th in the world in wage in the last 12 year since mr. bush and mr. reagan have be in personal income have drop while people have work hard in the last 4 year there have be twice as many bankruptcy as new job create

 we need a new approach the same old experience be not relevant we be live in a new world after the cold war and what work in this new world be not trickle down not government for the benefit of the privileged few not tax and spend but a commitment to invest in american job and american education control american health care cost and bring the american people together that be what work and you can have the right kind of experience and the wrong kind of experience mine be root in the real life of real people and it will bring real result if we have the courage to change

 mr. lehrer president bush one minute to respond

 president bush i just think of another another big difference here between i i do not believe mr. perot feel this way but i know governor clinton do because i want to accurately quote he he think i think he say that the country be come apart at the seam now i know that the only way he can win be to make everybody believe the economy be bad than it be but this country be not come apart at the seam for heaven sake we be the united states of america in spite of the economic problem we be the most respected economy around the world many would trade for it we have be catch up in a global slowdown we can do much much well but we ought not to try to convince the american people that america be a country that be come apart at the seam

 i would hate to be run for president and think that the only way i could win would be to convince everybody how horrible thing be yes there be big problem and yes people be hurt but i believe that this agenda for american renewal i have be the answer to do it and i believe we can get it do now whereas we do not in the past because you be go to have a whole brandnew bunch of people in the congress that be go to have to listen to the same american people i be listen to

 mr. lehrer mr. perot a minute response sir

 mr. perot well they have get a point i do not have any experience in run up a $ 4 trillion debt i do not have any experience in gridlocke government where nobody take responsibility for anything and everybody blame everybody else i do not have any experience in create the bad public school system in the industrialized world the most violent crime ride society in the industrialized world

 but i do have a lot of experience in get thing do so if we be at a point in history where we want to stop talk about it and do it i have get a lot of experience in figure out how to solve problem make the solution work and then move on to the next one i have get a lot of experience in not take 10 year to solve a 10 minute problem so if it be time for action i think i have experience that count if it be more time for gridlock and talk and finger pointing i be the wrong man

 character issues

 mr. lehrer president bush the question go to you you have 2 minute and the question be this be there important issue of character separate you from these other two man

 president bush i think the american people should be the judge of that i think character be a very important question i say something the other day where i be accuse of be like joe mccarthy because i question put it this way i think it be wrong to demonstrate against your own country or organize demonstration against your own country in foreign soil i just think it be wrong maybe they say well it be a youthful indiscretion i be 19 or 20 fly off an aircraft carrier and that shape i to be commander in chief of the armed forces and i be sorry but demonstrate it be not a question of patriotism it be a question of character and judgment

 they get on i bill 's get on i about read my lip when i make a mistake i will admit it but he have not admit the mistake and i just find it impossible to understand how an american can demonstrate against his own country in a foreign land organize demonstration against it when young man be hold prisoner in hanoi or kid out of the ghetto be draft

 some say well you be a little old fashioned maybe i be but i just do not think that be right now whether it be character or judgment whatever it be i have a big difference here on this issue and so we will just have to see how it play out but i could not do that and i do not think most americans could do that

 and they all say well it be a long time ago well let us admit it then say i make a terrible mistake how could you be commander in chief of the armed forces and have some kid say when you have to make a tough decision as i do in panama or in kuwait and then have some kid jump up and say well i be not go to go the commander in chief be organize demonstration halfway around the world during another era

 so there be difference but that be about the main area where i think we have a difference i do not know about we will talk about that a little with ross here in a bit

 mr. lehrer mr. perot you have one minute

 mr. perot i think the american people will make their own decision on character and at a time when we have work to do and we need action i think they need to clearly understand the background of each person i think the press can play a huge role in make sure that the background be clearly present in an objective way then make a decision

 certainly anyone in the white house should have the character to be there but i think it be very important to measure when and where thing occur do they occur when you be a young person in your formative year or do they occur while you be a senior official in the federal government when you be a senior official in the federal government spend billion of dollar in taxpayer money and you be a mature individual and you make a mistake then that be on our ticket if you make it as a young man time pass

 so i would say just look at all three of we decide who you think will do the job pick that person in november because believe i as i have say before the party be over and it be time for the cleanup crew and we do have to have change and people who never take responsibility for anything when it happen on their watch and people who be in charge

 mr. lehrer your time be up

 mr. perot the time be up

 mr. lehrer time be up

 mr. perot more later

 mr. lehrer governor clinton you have one minute

 governor clinton ross give a good answer but i have get to respond directly to mr. bush you have question my patriotism you even bring some right wing congressman into the white house to plot how to attack i for go to russia in 1969 1970 when over 50,000 other americans do

 now i honor your service in world war ii i honor mr. perot 's service in uniform and the service of every man and woman who ever serve include admiral crowe who be your chairman of the joint chiefs and who be support i but when joe mccarthy go around this country attack people 's patriotism he be wrong he be wrong and a senator from connecticut stand up to he name prescott bush your father be right to stand up to joe mccarthy you be wrong to attack my patriotism i be oppose to the war but i love my country and we need a president who will bring this country together not divide it we have have enough division i want to lead a unified country

 mr. lehrer all right we move now to the subject of taxis and spending the question go to governor clinton for a two minute answer it will be ask by ann compton

 taxes

 ann compton governor clinton can you lock in a level here tonight on where middle income family can be guarantee a tax cut or at the very least at what income level they can be guarantee no tax increase

 governor clinton the tax increase i have propose trigger in at family income of $ 200,000 and above those be the people who in the 1980 's have their income go up while their taxis go down middle class people define as people with income of $ 52,000 and down have their income go down while their taxis go up in the reagan bush year because of six increase in the payroll taxis so that be where my income limit would trigger

 ms. compton so there will be no tax increase below $ 200,000

 governor clinton my plan notwithstanding my opponent 's ad my plan trigger in at gross income family income of $ 200,000 and above and then we want to give modest middle class tax relief to restore some fairness especially to middle class people with family with income of under $ 60,000

 in addition to that the money that i raise from upper income people and from ask foreign corporation just to pay the same income on their income earn in america that american corporation do will be use to give incentive back to upper income people i want to give people permanent incentive on investment tax credit like president kennedy and the congress inaugurate in the early sixty to get industry move again a research and development tax credit a low income housing tax credit a long term capital gain proposal for new business and business expansion

 we have get to have no more trickle down we do not need across the board tax cut for the wealthy for nothing we need to say here be your tax incentive if you create american job the old fashioned way

 i would like to create more millionaire than be create under mr. bush and mr. reagan but i do not want to have 4 year where we have no growth in the private sector and that be what be happen in the last 4 year we be down 35,000 job in the private sector we need to invest and grow and that be what i want to do

 mr. lehrer president bush one minute sir

 president bush i have to correct one thing i do not question the man 's patriotism i question his judgment and his character what he do in moscow that be fine let he explain it he do i accept that what i do not accept be demonstrate and organize demonstration in a foreign country when your country 's at war i be sorry i can not accept that

 this one on taxis spell out the big difference between we i do not believe we need to go back to the mondale proposal or the dukakis proposal of tax and spend governor clinton say $ 200,000 but he also say he want to raise $ 150 billion tax people over $ 200,000 will not get you $ 150 billion and then when you add in his other spending proposal regrettably you end up sock it to the work man

 that old adage that they use we be go to soak the rich we be go to soak the rich it always end up be the poor cab driver or the work man that end up pay the bill and so i just have a different approach i believe the way to get the deficit down be to control the growth of mandatory spending program and not raise taxis on the american people we have get a big difference there

 mr. lehrer mr. perot one minute

 mr. perot we have get to have a grow expand job base to give we a grow expand tax base right now we have a flat to deteriorate job base and where it appear to be grow be minimum wage job so we have get to really rebuild our job base that be go to take money for infrastructure and investment to do that our foreign competitor be do it we be not

 we can not pay off the $ 4 trillion debt balance the budget and have the industry of the future and the high pay job in this country without have the revenue we be go to go through a period of share sacrifice there be one challenge it be get to be fair

 we have create a mess and do not have much to show for it and we have get to fix it and that be about all i can say in a minute

 mr. lehrer okay next question go to president bush for a 2 minute answer and it will be ask by sandy vanocur

 u.s. troop in europe

 sander vanocur mr. president this past week your secretary of the army michael stone say he have no plan to abide by a congressional mandate to cut u.s. force in europe from 150,000 to 100,000 by the end of september 1996 now why almost 50 year after the end of world war ii and with the total collapse of the soviet union should american taxpayer be tax support army in europe when the europeans have plenty of money to do it for themselves

 president bush well sander that be a good question and the answer be for 40 some year we keep the peace if you look at the cost of not keep the peace in europe it would be exorbitant we have reduce the number of troop that be deploy and go to be deploy i have cut defense spending and the reason we could do that be because of our fantastic success in win the cold war we never would have get there if we have go for the nuclear freeze crowd never would have get there if we have listen to those that want to cut defense spending i think it be important that the united states stay in europe and continue to guarantee the peace we simply can not pull back

 now when anybody have a spending program they want to spend money on at home they say well let us cut money out of the defense department i will accept and have accept the recommendation of two prove leader general colin powell and dick secretary dick cheney they feel that the level we be operate at and the reduction that i have propose be proper and so i simply do not think we should go back to the isolation day and start blame foreigner

 we be the sole remain superpower and we should be that we have a certain disproportionate responsibility but i would ask the american people to understand that if we make imprudent cut if we go too far we risk the peace and i do not want to do that i have see what it be like to see the burden of a war and i do not want to see we make reckless cut

 because of our program we have be able to significantly cut defense spending but let us not cut into the muscle and let us not cut down our insurance policy which be participation of american force in nato the great peacekeeping organization ever make today you have get problem in europe still bubble along even though europe 's go democracy 's route but we be there and i think this insurance policy be necessary i think it go with world leadership and i think the level we have come up with be just about right

 mr. lehrer mr. perot one minute sir

 mr. perot if i be poor and you be rich and i can get you to defend i that be good but when the table get turn i ought to do my share right now we spend about $ 300 billion a year on defense the japanese spend around $ 30 billion in asia the germans spend around $ 30 billion in europe

 for example germany will spend a trillion dollar building infrastructure over the next 10 year it be kind of easy to do if you only have to pick up a $ 30 billion tab to defend your country the european community be in a position to pay a lot more than they have in the past i agree with the president when they could not we should have now that they can they should

 we sort of seem to have a desire to try to stay over there and control it they do not want we to control it very candidly so it i think be very important for we to let they assume more and more of the burden and for we to bring that money back here and rebuild our infrastructure because we can only be a superpower if we be an economic superpower and we can only be an economic superpower if we have a grow expand job base

 mr. lehrer governor clinton one minute sir

 governor clinton i agree with the general statement mr. bush make i disagree that we need 150,000 troop to fulfill our role in europe we certainly must maintain an engagement there there be certainly danger there there be certainly other trouble spot in the world which be close to europe than to the united states but two former defense secretaries recently issue report say that 100,000 or slightly few troop would be enough include president reagan 's former defense secretary mr. carlucci many of the military expert whom i consult on this agree

 we be go to have to spend more money in the future on military technology and on great mobility great airlift great sealift the b-22 airplane we be go to have to do some thing that be quite costly and i simply do not believe we can afford nor do we need to keep 150,000 troop in europe give how much the red army now under the control of russia have be cut the arm control agreement conclude between mr. bush and mr. yeltsin something i have applaud i do not think we need 150,000 troop

 let i make one other point mr. bush talk about taxis he do not tell you that he veto a middle class tax cut because it would be pay for by raise taxis on the wealthy and veto an investment tax credit pay for by raise taxis on the wealthy

 taxes

 mr. lehrer all right we go now to mr. perot for a 2 minute question and it will be ask by john mashek

 john mashek mr. perot you talk about fairness just a minute ago on share the pain as part of your plan to reduce the ballooning federal deficit you have suggest that we raise gasoline taxis 50 cent a gallon over 5 year why punish the middle class consumer to such a degree

 mr. perot it be 10 cent a year cumulative it finally get to 50 cent at the end of the fifth year i think punish be the wrong word again you see i do not create this problem we be try to solve it

 now if you study our international competitor some of our international competitor collect up to $ 3.50 a gallon in taxis and they use that money to build infrastructure and create job we collect 35 cent and we do not have it to spend i know it be not popular and i understand the nature of your question but the people who will be help the most by it be the work people who will get the job create because of this tax why do we have to do it because we have so mismanage our country over the year and it be now time to pay the fiddler and if we do not we will be spend our child 's money we have spend $ 4 trillion worth an incredible number of young people be active in support my effort because they be deeply concerned that we have take the american dream from they

 i think it be fitting that we be on the campus of a university tonight these young people when they get out of this wonderful university will have difficulty find a job we have get to clean this mess up leave this country in good shape and pass on the american dream to they we be get to collect the taxis to do it if there be a fair way i be all ear ah h h.

 but see let i make it very clear people do not have the stomach to fix these problem i think it be a good time to face it in november if they do then they will have hear the harsh reality of what we have to do i be not play lawrence welk music tonight

 mr. lehrer governor clinton you have a minute sir

 governor clinton i think mr. perot have confront this deficit issue but i think it be important to point out that we really have two deficit in america not one we have a budget deficit in the federal government but we also have an investment a job an income deficit

 people be work hard for less money than they be make 10 year ago two third of our people a $ 1,600 drop in average income in just the last 2 year the problem i have with the perot prescription be that almost all economist who have look at it say that if you cut the deficit this much this quick it will increase unemployment it will slow down the economy that be why i think we should not do it that quickly we have a discipline reduction in the deficit of 50 percent over the next 4 year but first get incentive to invest in this economy put the american people back to work we have get to invest in growth nine nobel prize win economist and 500 other include numerous republican and democratic business executive have endorse this approach because it offer the good hope to put america back to work and get our income rise instead of fall

 mr. lehrer president bush one minute sir

 president bush the question be on fairness i just disagree with mr. perot i do not believe it be fair to slap a 50 cent a gallon tax over whatever many year on the people that have to drive for a living people that go long distance i do not think we need to do it

 you see i have a fundamental difference i agree with what he be talk about in try to get the spending down and to discipline although i think we ought to totally exempt social security but he be talk tough medicine and i think that be good i disagree with the tax and spend philosophy you see i do not think we need to tax more and spend more and then say that be go to make the problem well and i be afraid that be what i think i be hear from governor clinton

 i believe what you need to do be some of what ross be talk about control the growth of mandatory spending and get taxis down he be mention some way to do it and i agree with those i have be talk about get a capital gain cut forever and his friend in congress have be tell i that be a tax break for the rich it would stimulate investment i be for an investment tax allowance i be for a tax break for first time homebuyer and with this new congress come in gridlock will be go and i will sit down with they and say let us get this do but i do not want to go the tax and spend route

 mr. lehrer all right let us move on now to the subject of job the first question go to president bush for 2 minute and john will ask that question john

 the defense industry

 mr. mashek mr. president last month you come to st. louis to announce a very lucrative contract for mcdonnell douglas to build f-15 's for saudi arabia in today 's post dispatch a retired saleswoman a 75 year old woman name marjorie roberts ask if she could ask a question of the candidate say she want to register her concern about the lack of a plan to convert our defense orient industry into other purpose how would you answer she

 president bush well i assume she be supportive of the decision on mcdonnell douglas i assume she be support i on the decision to sell those airplane i think it be a good decision i take a little heat for it but i think it be the correct decision to do and we have work it out and indeed we be move forward all around the world in a much more peaceful way so that one we come away with which in create job for the american people

 i would simply say to she look take a look at what the president have propose on job retraining when you cut back on defense spending some people be go to be throw out of work if you throw another 50,000 kid on the street because of cut recklessly in troop level you be go to put a lot more out of work i would say to they look at the job retrain program that we be propose therein be the good answer to she

 and another one be stimulate investment and saving i mean we have get big economic problem but we be not come apart at the seam we be ready for a recovery with interest rate down and inflation down the cruel tax of all catch up in a global slowdown right now but that will change if you go with the program i have talk about and if you help with job retraining and education

 i be a firm believer that our america 2000 education problem be the answer a little long run it be go to take a while to educate but it be a good program so her good hope for short term be job retraining if she be throw out of work at a defense plant but tell she it be not all that gloomy we be the united states we have face tough problem before look at the misery index when the democrats have both the white house and the congress it be just right through the roof

 now we can do well and the way to do well be not to tax and spend but to retrain get that control of the mandatory spending program i be much more optimistic about this country than some

 mr. lehrer mr. perot you have one minute sir

 mr. perot your defense industry be go to have to convert to civilian industry many of they be and the soon they start the soon they will finish and there will be a significant transition

 and it be very important that we not continue to let our industrial base deteriorate we have someone who i be sure regret say it in the president 's staff say he do not care whether we make potato chip or computer chip well anybody that think about it care a great deal number one you make more make computer chip than you do potato chip number two 19 out of 20 computer chip that we have in this country now come from japan we have give away whole industry

 so as we phase these industry over there be a lot of intellectual talent in these industry a lot of these people in industry can be convert to the industry of tomorrow and that be where the high pay job be we need to have a very carefully think through phaseover

 see we practice 19th century capitalism the rest of the world practice 21st century capitalism i can not handle that in a minute but i hope we can get back into it later the rest of the world the country and the business would be work together to make this transition in an intelligent way

 mr. lehrer governor clinton you have one minute sir

 governor clinton we must have a transition plan a plan to convert from a defense to a domestic economy no other nation would have cut defense as much as we already have without that there be 200,000 people unemployed in california alone because we have cut defense without plan to retrain they and to reinvest in the technology of the future here at home that be what i want to do

 this administration may say they have a plan but the truth be they have not even release all the money the paltry sum of money that congress appropriate i want to take every dollar by which we reduce defense and reinvest it in technology for the 21st century in new transportation in communication and environmental cleanup technology let us put the american people to work and let us build the kind of high tech high wage high growth economy that the american people deserve

 mr. lehrer all right the next question go to mr. perot for a 2 minute answer it will be ask by ann

 ann

 jobs program

 ms. compton mr. perot you talk a minute ago about rebuild the job base but be it true what governor clinton just say that that mean that unemployment will increase that it will slow the economy and how would you specifically use the power of the presidency to get more people back into good job immediately

 mr. perot step one the american people send i up there the day after election i will get with the we will not even wait until inauguration i will ask the president to help i and i will ask his staff to help i and we will start put together team to put together to take all the plan that exist and do something with they

 please understand there be great plan lie all over washington nobody ever execute it be like have a blueprint for a house you never build you do not have anywhere to sleep now our challenge be to take these thing do something with they

 step one you want to put america back to work clean up the small business problem have one task force at work on that the second you have get your big company that be in trouble include the defense industry have another one on that have a third task force on new industry of the future to make sure we nail those for our country and they do not wind up in europe and asia convert from 19th to 21st century capitalism you see we have an adversarial relationship between government and business our international competitor that be clean our plate have an intelligent relationship between government and business and a supportive relationship

 then have another task force on crime because next to job our people be concerned about their safety health care school one on the debt and deficit and finally in that 90 day period before the inauguration put together the framework for the town hall and give the american people a christmas present show they by christmas the first cut at these plan by the time congress come into session to go to work have those plan ready to go in front of congress then get off to a fly start in 93 to execute these plan

 now there be people in this room and people on this stage who have be in meeting when i would sit there and say be this one we be go to talk about or do something about well obviously my orientation be let us go do it

 now put together your plan by christmas be ready to go when congress go nail these thing small business you have get to have capital you have get to have credit and many of they need mentor or coach and we can create more job there in a hurry than any other place

 mr. lehrer governor clinton one minute

 governor clinton this country desperately need a job program and my first priority would be to pass a job program to introduce it on the first day i be inaugurate i would meet with the leader of the congress with all the newly elect member of the congress and as many other with whom i could meet between the time of the election and the inauguration and we would present a job program

 then we would present a plan to control health care cost and phase in health care coverage for all americans until we control health care cost we be not go to control the deficit it be the number one culprit but first we must have an aggressive job program

 i live in a state where manufacturing job growth have far outpace the nation in the last few year where we have create more private sector job since mr. bush have be president than have be create in the entire rest of the country where mr. bush 's labor secretary say the job growth have be enormous we have do it in arkansas give i a chance to create these kind of job in america we can do it i know we can

 mr. lehrer president bush one minute

 president bush well we have get a plan announce for what we can do for small business i have already put forward thing that will get this country work fast some of which have be echo here tonight investment tax allowance capital gain reduction more on research and development a tax credit for first time homebuyer

 what i be go to do be say to jim baker when this campaign be over all right let us sit down now you do in domestic affair what you have do in foreign affair be the kind of economic coordinator of all the domestic side of the house and that include all the economic side all the training side and bring this program together we be go to have a new congress and we be go to say to they you have listen to the voter the way we have nobody want gridlock anymore and so let us get the program through

 and i believe it will work because as ross say we have get the plan the plan be all over washington and i have put ours together in something call the agenda for american renewal and it make sense it be sensible it create job it get to the base of the kind of job we need and so i will just be ask for support to get that put into effect

 mr. lehrer the next question go to governor clinton for 2 minute it will be ask by sandy

 federal reserve board chairman

 mr. vanocur governor clinton when a president run for the first time get into the office and want to do something about the economy he find in washington there be a person who have much more power over the economy than he do the chairman of the federal reserve board accountable to no one that be the case would you go along with proposal make by treasury secretary james brady and congressman lee hamilton to make the federal reserve board chairman somehow more accountable to elect official

 governor clinton well let i say that i think that we might ought to review the term and the way it work but frankly i do not think that be the problem today we have low interest rate today at least we have low interest rate that the fed can control our long term interest rate be still pretty high because of our deficit and because of our economic performance

 and there be a terrible reaction internationally to mr. bush say he be go to give we 4 more year of trickle down economic and other across the board tax cut and most of it go to the wealthy with no real guarantee of investment but i think the important thing be to use the power the president do have on the assumption that give the condition of this economy we be go to keep interest rate down if we have the discipline to increase investment and reduce the debt at the same time that be my commitment

 i think the american people be hungry for action i think congress be hungry for someone who will work with they instead of manipulate they someone who will not veto a bill that have an investment credit middle class tax relief research and development tax credit as mr. bush have do give i a chance to do that

 i do not have to worry i do not think in the near term about the federal reserve their policy so far it seem to i be pretty sound

 mr. lehrer president bush you have one minute

 president bush i do not think the fed ought to be put under the executive branch there be separation there i think that be fine alan greenspan be respect i have have some argument with he about the speed in which we might have lower rate

 but governor clinton he talk about the reaction to the market there be a momentary fear that he might win and the market go rrrfft down like that so i do not we can judge on the stock market have be strong it be be very strong since i have be president and they recognize we have get great difficulty but they be also much more optimistic than the pessimist we have up here tonight

 in term of veto tax bill you be darn right i be go to protect the american taxpayer against the spend and tax congress and i be go to keep on veto they because i do not think we be tax too little i think the government 's spending too much so governor clinton can label it tax for the rich or anything he want i be go to protect the work man by continue to veto and to threaten veto until we get this new congress when then we be go to move forward on our plan i`ve get to protect they

 mr. lehrer mr. perot one minute

 mr. perot keep the federal reserve independent but let us live in a world of reality we live in a global economy not a national economy these interest rate we have now do not make any sense we have a $ 4 trillion debt and only in america would you finance 70 percent of it 5 year or less so 70 percent of our debt be 5 year or less it be very interest sensitive

 we have a 4 percent gap between what we pay for treasury and what germany pay for 1- to 5 year treasury that gap be go to close because the arabs the japanese and folk in this country be go to start buy german treasury because they can get more money

 every time our interest rate go up 1 percent that add $ 28 billion to the deficit or to the debt whichever place you want to put it we be sit on a tick bomb folk because we have totally mismanage our country and we have well get it back under control

 just think in your own business if you have all of your long term problem finance short term you would go broke in a hurry

 mr. lehrer we be go to move to foreign affair the first question go to mr. perot for a 2 minute answer and sandy will ask it

 foreign affairs

 mr. vanocur mr. perot in the post cold war environment what should be the override u.s. national interest and what can the united states do and what can it afford to do to defend that national interest

 mr. perot again if you be not rich you be not a superpower so we have two that i would put as number one i have a 1 and 1a one be we have get to have the money to be able to pay for defense and we have get to manufacture here believe it or not folk you can not ship it all overseas you have get to make it here and you can not convert from potato chip to airplane in an emergency you see willow run could be convert from car to airplane in world war ii because it be here we have get to make thing here you just can not ship they overseas anymore i hope we talk more about that

 second thing on priority we have get to help russia succeed in its revolution and all of its republic when we think of russia remember we be think of many country now we have get to help they that be penny on the dollar compare to renew the cold war

 third we have get all kind of agreement on paper and some that be be execute on get rid of nuclear warhead russia and its republic be out of control or at good in weak control right now it be a very unstable situation you have get every rich middle eastern country over there try to buy nuclear weapon as you well know and that will lead to another five star migraine headache down the road we really need to nail down the intercontinental ballistic missile the one that can hit we from russia we have focus on the tactical we have make real progress there we have get some agreement on the nuclear but we do not have those thing put away yet the soon the well

 so in term of priority we have get to be financially strong number two we have get to take care of this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind we and give that a very high priority and number three we need to help and support russia and the republic in every possible way to become democratic capitalistic society and not just sit back and let those country continue in turmoil because they could go back bad than thing use to be and believe i there be a lot of old boy in the kgb and the military that like it well the way it use to be thank you

 mr. lehrer governor clinton one minute

 governor clinton in order to keep america the strong nation in the world we need some continuity and some change there be three fundamental challenge first of all the world be still a dangerous and uncertain place we need a new military and a new national security policy equal to the challenge of the post cold war era a small permanent military force but one that be more mobile well train with high technology equipment we need to continue the negotiation to reduce nuclear arsenal in the soviet union the former soviet union and the united states we need to stop this proliferation of weapon of mass destruction

 second we have to face that in this world economic security be a whole lot of national security our dollar be at an all time low against some foreign currency we be weak in the world we must rebuild america 's strength at home

 finally we ought to be promote the democratic impulse around the world democracy be our partner they do not go to war with each other they be reliable friend in the future national security economic strength democracy

 mr. lehrer president bush one minute

 president bush we still be the envy of the world in term of our military there be no question about that we be the envy of the world in term of our economy in spite of the difficulty we be have there be no question about that our export be dramatically up

 i might say to mr. perot i can understand why you might have miss it because there be so much fascination by trivium but i work out a deal with boris yeltsin to eliminate get rid of entirely the most destabilizing weapon of all the ss-18 the big intercontinental ballistic missile i mean that be be do and thank god it have because the parent of these young people around here go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war we have make dramatic progress

 so we have get a good military the question that say get a new military get the good in the world we have get it and they be keep the peace they be respect around the world and we be more respected because of the way we have conduct ourselves

 we do not listen to the nuclear freeze crowd we say peace through strength it work and the cold war be over america understand that but we be turn so inward we do not understand the global picture we be help democracy ross the freedom support act be something that i get through the congress and it be a very good thing because it do exactly what you say and i think you agree with that to help russian democracy we be go to keep on do that

 mr. lehrer all right next question be for governor clinton and john will ask it

 china u.s. relations

 mr. mashek governor clinton you have accuse the president of coddle tyrant include those in beijing as president how would you exert u.s. power to influence affair in china

 governor clinton i think our relation ship with china be important and i do not think we want to isolate china but i think it be a mistake for we to do what this administration do when all those kid go out there carry the statue of liberty in tiananmen square and mr. bush send two people in secret to toast the chinese leader and basically tell they not to worry about it they reward he by open negotiation with iran to transfer nuclear technology that be their response to that sort of action

 now that voice in the congress and throughout the country have insist that we do something about china look what have happen china have finally agree to stop send we product make with prison labor not because we coddle they but because the administration be push into do something about it recently the chinese have announce that they be go to lower some barrier to our product which they ought to do since they have a $ 15 billion trade surplus with the united states under mr. bush the second big surplus of all second to japan

 so i would be firm i would say if you want to continue most favor nation status for your government own industry as well as your private one observe human right in the future open your society recognize the legitimacy of those kid that be carry the statue of liberty if we can stand up for our economic interest we ought to be able to pursue the democratic interest of the people in china and over the long run they will be more reliable partner

 mr. lehrer president bush you have one minute

 president bush well the administration be the first major country to stand up against the abuse in tiananmen square we be the one that work out the prison labor deal we be the one that have lower the barrier to product the carla hills negotiation i be the one that say let us keep the mfn because you see china move toward a free market economy to do what the congress and governor clinton be suggest you would isolate and ruin hong kong they be make some progress not enough for we we be the first one to put sanction on we still have they on some thing

 but governor clinton 's philosophy be isolate they he say do not do it but the policy he be expound of put condition on mfn and kind of humiliate they be not the way you make the kind of progress we be get i have stand up with these people and i understand what you have to do to be strong in this situation it be move not as fast as we would like but you isolate china and turn they inward and then we have make a tremendous mistake i be not go to do it i have have to fight a lot of people that be say human right we be the one that put the sanction on and stand for it and he can insult general scowcroft if he want to he do not go over to coddle he go over to say

 mr. lehrer mr. president you be over

 president bush you must make the very change they be make now

 mr. lehrer one minute mr. perot

 mr. perot china 's a huge country break into many province it have some very elderly leader that will not be around too much long capitalism be grow and thrive across big portion of china asia will be our large trading partner in the future it will be a grow and a close relationship we have a delicate tightwire walk that we must go through at the present time to make sure that we do not cozy up to tyrant to make sure that they do not get the impression that they can suppress their people but time be our friend there because their leader will change in not too many year bad case and their country be make great progress

 one last point on the missile i do not want the american people to be confuse we have write agreement and we have some missile that have be destroy but we have a huge number of intercontinental ballistic missile that be still in place in russia the fact that you have an agreement be one thing until they be destroy some crazy person can either sell they or use they

 mr. lehrer all right the next question go to president bush for a 2 minute answer and ann will ask it

 bosnia and somalia

 ms. compton mr. president how can you watch the killing in bosnia and the ethnic cleansing or the starvation and anarchy in somalia and not want to use america 's might if not america 's military to try to end that kind of suffer

 president bush ann both of they be very complicated situation i vow something because i learn something from vietnam i be not go to commit u.s. force until i know what the mission be until the military tell i that it can be complete until i know how they can come out

 we be help american airplane be help today on humanitarian relief for sarajevo it be america that be in the lead in help with humanitarian relief for somalia but when you go to put somebody else 's son or daughter into war i think you have get to be a little bit careful and you have to be sure that there be a military plan that can do this

 you have ancient ethnic rivalry that have crop up as yugoslavia be dissolve or getting dissolve it be not go to be solve by send in the 82d airborne and i be not go to do that as commander in chief i be go to stand by and use the moral persuasion of the united states to get satisfaction in term of prison camp and we be make some progress there and in term of get humanitarian relief in there

 right now as you know the united states take the lead in a no fly operation up there no fly order up in the united nations we be work through the international organization that be one thing i learn by forge that tremendous and greatly highly successful coalition against saddam hussein the dictator work internationally to do it i be very concerned about it i be concerned about ethnic cleansing i be concerned about attack on muslims for example over there but i must stop short of use american force until i know how those young man and woman be go to get out of there as well as get in know what the mission be and define it i think i be on the right track

 ms. compton be you design a mission that would

 mr. lehrer ann sorry sorry time be up we have to go to mr. perot for a one minute response

 mr. perot if we learn anything in vietnam it be you first commit this nation before you commit the troop to the battlefield we can not send our people all over the world to solve every problem that come up

 this be basically a problem that be a primary concern to the european community certainly we care about the people we care about the child we care about the tragedy but it be inappropriate for we just because there be a problem somewhere around the world to take the son and daughter of work people and make no mistake about it our all volunteer armed force be not make up of the son and daughter of the beautiful people it be the work folk that send their son and daughter to war with a few exception very unlike world war ii when fdr 's son fly mission everybody go it be a different world now it be very important that we not just without think it through just rush to every problem in the world and have our people tear to piece

 mr. lehrer governor clinton one minute

 governor clinton i agree that we can not commit ground force to become involved in the quagmire of bosnia or in the tribal war of somalia but i think that it be important to recognize that there be thing that can be do short of that and that we do have interest there there be after all two million refugee now because of the problem in what be yugoslavia the large number since world war ii and there may be hundred of thousand of people who will starve or freeze to death in this winter

 the united states should try to work with its ally and stop it i urge the president to support this air cover and he do and i applaud that i applaud the no fly zone and i know that he be go back to the united nations to try to get authority to enforce it i think we should stiffen the embargo on the belgrade government i think we have to consider whether or not we should lift the arm embargo now on the bosnians since they be in no way in a fair fight with a heavily armed opponent bent on ethnic cleansing we can not get involve in the quagmire but we must do what we can

 mr. lehrer all right move on now to division in our country the first question go to governor clinton for two minute and ann will ask it

 family value

 ms. compton governor clinton can you tell we what your definition of the word family be

 governor clinton a family involve at least one parent whether natural or adoptive or foster and child a good family be a place where love and discipline and good value be transmute from the elder to the child a place where people turn for refuge and where they know they be the most important people in the world

 america have a lot of family that be in trouble today there be be a lot of talk about family value in this campaign i know a lot about that i be bear to a widow mother who give i family value and grandparent i have see the family value of my people in arkansas i have see the family value of all these people in america who be out there kill themselves work hard for less in a country that be have the bad economic year in 50 year and the first decline in industrial production ever

 i think the president owe it to family value to show that he value america 's family whether they be people on welfare you be try to move from welfare to work the work poor whom i think deserve a tax break to lift they above poverty if they have get a child in the house and work 40 hour a week work family who deserve a fair tax system and the opportunity for constant retraining they deserve a strong economy i think they deserve a family and medical leave act seventy two other nation have be able to do it mr. bush veto it twice because he say we can not do something 72 other country do even though there be a small business exemption

 so with all the talk about family value i know about family value i would not be here without they the good expression of my family value be that tonight 's my 17th wedding anniversary and i would like to close my question by just wish my wife a happy anniversary and thank my daughter for be here

 mr. lehrer president bush one minute

 president bush well i would say that one meeting that make a profound impression on i be when the mayor of the big city include the mayor of los angeles a democrat come to see i and they unanimously say the decline in urban america stem from the decline in the american family so i do think we need to strengthen family when barbara hold an aids baby she be show a certain compassion for family when she read to child the same thing

 i believe that discipline and respect for the law all of these thing should be teach to child not in our school but family have to do that i be appal at the high outrageous number of divorce it be happen in family it be happen in ours but it be get too much and i just think that we ought to do everything we can to respect the american family it can be a single parent family those mother need help one way to do it be to get these deadbeat father to pay their obligation to these mother that will help strengthen the american family and there be a whole bunch of other thing that i can not click off in this short period of time

 mr. lehrer mr. perot you have one minute

 mr. perot if i have to solve all the problem that face this country and i could be grant one wish as we start down the trail to rebuild the job base the school and so on and so forth i would say a strong family unit in every home where every child be love nurture and encourage a little child before they be 18 month learn to think well of himself or herself or poorly they develop a positive or negative self image at a very early age they learn how to learn if we have child who be not surround with love and affection see i look at my grandchild and wonder if they will ever learn to walk because they be always in someone 's arm i think my gosh would not it be wonderful if every child have that love and support but they do not

 we will not be a great country unless we have a strong family unit in every home and i think you can use the white house as a bully pulpit to stress the importance of these little child particularly in their young and formative year to mold these little precious piece of clay so that they too can live rich full life when they be grow

 mr. lehrer new question 2 minute answer go to president bush sandy will ask it

 legalization of drugs

 mr. vanocur mr. president there be be a lot of talk about harry truman in this campaign so much so that i think tomorrow i will wake up and see he name as the next commissioner of baseball

 president bush we could use one

 mr. vanocur the thing that mr. truman do not have to deal with is drug americans be increasingly alarmed about drug relate crime in city and suburb and your administration be not the first to have grapple with this be you at all of a mind that maybe it ought to go to another level if not to what be advocate by william f. buckley jr. and milton friedman legalization somewhere between there and where we be now

 president bush no i do not think that be the right answer i do not believe legalize narcotic be the answer i just do not believe that be the answer i do believe that there be some fairly good news out there the use of cocaine for example by teenager be dramatically down but we have get to keep fight on this war against drug

 we be do a little well in interdiction many of the country that use to say well this be a united states problem if you would get the demand down then we would not have the problem be work cooperatively with the dea and other law the military we be use the military more now in term of interdiction our funding for recovery be up recover the addict

 where we be not make the progress sander be in we be make it in teenager and thank god because i think what ross say be most appropriate about these family and these child but where we be not make it be with the confirm addict i will tell you one place that be work well and that be the private sector jim burke and this task force that he have you may know about it tell the american people but this man say i will get you a million dollar a day in pro bono advertising something that be very hard for the government to do he go out and he do it and people be begin to educate through this program teach these kid you should not use drug

 so we be still in the fight but i must tell you i think legalization of narcotic or something of that nature in the face of the medical evidence would be totally counterproductive and i oppose it and i be go to stand up and continue to oppose it

 mr. lehrer mr. perot one minute

 mr. perot any time you think you want to legalize drug go to a neonatal unit if you can get in they be between 100 and 200 percent capacity up and down the east coast and the reason be crack baby be bear baby be in the hospital 42 day typical cost to you and i be $ 125,000 again and again and again the mother disappear in 3 day and the child become a ward of the state because he be permanently and genetically damage just look at those little child and if anybody can even think about legalize drug they have lose i

 now let us look at priority we go on the libyan raid you remember that one because we be worried to death that qadhafi might be build up chemical weapon we have get chemical warfare be conduct against our child on the street in this country all day every day and we do not have the will to stamp it out

 again if i get up there if you send i we be go to have some blunt talk about this we be really go to get out in the trench and say be this one you want to talk about or fix because talk will not do it folk there be guy that could not get a job third shift in a dairy queen drive bmw 's and mercedes sell drug these old boy be not go to quit easy

 mr. lehrer governor clinton one minute

 governor clinton like mr. perot i have hold crack baby in my arm but i know more about this i think than anybody else up here because i have a brother who be a recover drug addict i be very proud of he but i can tell you this if drug be legal i do not think he would be alive today i be adamantly opposed to legalize drug he be alive today because of the criminal justice system

 that be a mistake what should we do first we ought to prevent more of this on the street thirty year ago there be three policeman for every crime now there be three crime for every policeman we need 100,000 more police on the street i have a plan for that secondly we ought to have treatment on demand thirdly we ought to have boot camp for first time nonviolent offender so they can get discipline and treatment and education and get reconnecte to the community before they be sever and send to prison where they can learn how to be first class criminal

 there be a crime bill that lamentably be block from passage once again mostly by republicans in the united states senate which would have address some of these problem that crime bill be go to be one of my high priority next january if i become president

 mr. lehrer next question be to you mr. perot you have 2 minute to answer it and john will ask it

 racial harmony

 mr. mashek mr. perot racial division continue to tear apart our great city the last episode be this spring in los angeles why be this still happen in america and what would you do to end it

 mr. perot this be a relevant question here tonight first thing i would do be during political campaign i would urge everybody to stop try to split this country into fragment and appeal to the difference between we and then wonder why the melting pot 's all break to piece after november the 3d

 we be all in this together we ought to love one another because united team win and divide team lose if we can not love one another we ought to get along with one another if you can not get there just recognize we be all stuck with one another because nobody be go anywhere right

 now that ought to get everybody back up to let us get along together and make it work our diversity be a strength we have turn it into a weakness

 now again the white house be a bully pulpit i think whoever be in the white house should just make it absolutely unconscionable and inexcusable and if anybody be in the middle of a speech at you know one of these convention i would expect the candidate to go out and lift he off the stage if he start preach hate because we do not have time for it

 our difference be our strength we have get to pull together in athletic we know it you see divide team lose united team win we have get to unite and pull together and there be nothing we can not do but if we sit around blow all this energy out the window on racial strife and hatred we be stick with a sure loser because we have be a melting pot we be become more and more of a melting pot let us make it a strength not a weakness

 mr. lehrer governor clinton one minute

 governor clinton i grow up in the segregated south thankfully raise by a grandfather with almost no formal education but with a heart of gold who teach i early that all people be equal in the eye of god i see the wind of hatred divide people and keep the people of my state poorer than they would have be spiritually and economically i have do everything i could in my public life to overcome racial division we do not have a person to waste in this country

 we be be murder economically because we have too many dropout we have too many low birth weight baby we have too many drug addict as kid we have too much violence we be too divide by race by income by region i have devote a major portion of this campaign to go across this country and look for opportunity to go to white group and african american group and latino group asian american group and say the same thing if the american people can not be bring together we can not turn this country around if we can come together nothing nothing can stop we

 mr. lehrer mr. president one minute

 president bush well i think governor clinton be commit i do think it be fair to note he can rebut it that arkansas be one of the few state that do not have any civil right legislation

 i have try to use the white house as a bully pulpit speak out against discrimination we pass two very forward look civil right bill it be not go to be all do by legislation but i do think that you need to make an appeal every time you can to eliminate racial division and discrimination and i will keep on do that and point to some legislative accomplishment to back it up

 i have to take 10 second here at the end the red light be not on yet to say to ross perot please do not say to the dea agent on the street that we do not have the will to fight drug please i have watch these people the same for our local law enforcement people we be back they in every way we possibly can but maybe you mean that some in the country do not have the will to fight it but those that be out there on the front line as you know you have be a strong backer of law enforcement really i just want to clear that up have the will to fight it and frankly some of they be give their life

 mr. lehrer time mr. president all right let us go now to another subject the subject of health the first question for 2 minute be to president bush and john will ask it

 aids

 mr. mashek mr. president yesterday ten of thousand of people parade past the white house to demonstrate their concern about the disease aids a celebrated member of your commission magic johnson quit say that there be too much inaction where be this widespread feeling come from that your administration be not do enough about aids

 president bush come from the political process we have increase funding for aids we have double it on research and on every other aspect of it my request for this year be $ 4.9 billion for aids 10 time as much for aids victim as per cancer victim i think that we be show the proper compassion and concern so i can not tell you where it be come from but i be very much concerned about aids and i believe that we have get the good researcher in the world out there at nih work the problem we be fund they i wish there be more money but we be fund they far more than any time in the past we be go to keep on do that

 i do not know i be a little disappointed in magic because he come to i and i say now if you see something we be not do get ahold of i call i let i know he go to one meeting and then we hear that he be step down so he be be replace by mary fisher who electrify the republican convention by talk about the compassion and the concern that we feel it be a beautiful moment and i think she will do a first class job on that commission

 so i think the appeal be yes we care the other thing be part of aids it be one of the few disease where behavior matter and i once call on somebody well change your behavior if the behavior you be use be prone to cause aids change the behavior the next thing i know one of these act up group be out say bush ought to change his behavior you can not talk about it rationally the extreme be hurt the aids cause to go into a catholic mass in a beautiful cathedral in new york under the cause of help in aids and start throw condom around in the mass i be sorry i think it set back the cause we can not move to the extreme

 we have get to care we have get to continue everything we can at the federal and the local level barbara i think be do a superb job in destroy the myth about aids all of we be in this fight together all of we care do not go to the extreme

 mr. lehrer one minute mr. perot

 mr. perot first i think mary fisher be a great choice we be lucky to have she head the commission secondly i think one thing that if i be send to do the job i would sit down with fda look exactly where we be then i would really focus on let us get these thing out if you be go to die you do not have to go through this 10 year cycle that fda go through on new drug believe i people with aids be more than willing to take that risk we could be move out to the human population a whole lot fast than we be on some of these new drug so i think we can expedite the problem there

 let i go back a minute to racial divisiveness all time low in our country be the judge thomas anita hill hearing and those senator ought to be hang their head in shame for what they do there

 second thing there be not many time in your life when you get to talk to a whole country but let i just say this to all of america if you hate people i do not want your vote that be how strongly i feel about it

 mr. lehrer governor clinton one minute

 governor clinton over 150,000 americans have die of aids well over a million and a quarter americans be hiv positive we need to put one person in charge of the battle against aids to cut across all the agency that deal with it we need to accelerate the drug approval process we need to fully fund the act name for that wonderful boy ryan white to make sure we be do everything we can on research and treatment the president should lead a national effort to change behavior to keep our child alive in the school responsible behavior to keep people alive this be a matter of life and death

 i have work in my state to reduce teen pregnancy and illness among child and i know it be tough the reason magic johnson resign from the aids commission be because the statement you hear tonight from mr. bush be the long and good statement he be make about it in public i be proud of what we do at the democratic convention put two hiv positive people on the platform and i be proud of the leadership that i be go to bring to this country in deal with the aids crisis

 mr. lehrer new question for mr. perot you have 2 minute to answer and ann will ask it

 entitlement programs

 ms. compton mr. perot even if you have get what people say be the gut to take on change in the most popular and the most sacred of the entitlement medicare people say you have not a prayer of actually get anything pass in washington since the president be not a lone ranger how in the world can you make some of those unpopular change

 mr. perot two way number one if i get there it will be a very unusual and historical event because laughter because the people not the special interest put i there i will have a unique mandate i have say again and again and this really upset the establishment in washington that we be go to inform the people in detail on the issue through an electronic town hall so that they really know what be go on they will want to do what be good for our country

 now all these fellow with thousand dollar suit and alligator shoe run up and down the halls of congress that make policy now the lobbyist the pac guy the foreign lobbyist what have you they will be over there in the smithsonian laughter because we be go to get rid of they the congress will be listen to the people and the american people be willing to have fair share sacrifice they be not as stupid as washington think they be the american people be bright intelligent caring love people who want a great country for their child and grandchild they will make those sacrifice so i welcome that challenge and just watch because if the american people send i there we will get it do

 now everybody will faint in washington they have never see anything happen in that town this be a town where the white house say congress do it congress say the white house do it and i be sit there and say well who else could be around and then when they get off by themselves they say nobody do it and yet the cash register be empty and it use to have our money the taxpayer money in it and we do not get the result we will get it do

 mr. lehrer governor one minute

 governor clinton ross that be a great speech but it be not quite that simple i mean look at the fact both party in washington the president and the congress have cut medicare the average senior citizen be spend a high percentage of income on health care today than they be in 1965 before medicare come in the president 's get another proposal to require they to pay $ 400 a year more for the next 5 year

 but if you do not have the gut to control cost by change the insurance system and take on the bureaucracy and the regulation of health care in the private and public sector you can not fix this problem cost will continue to spiral just remember this folk a lot of folk on medicare be out there every day make the choice between food and medicine not poor enough for medicare medicaid not wealthy enough to buy their medicine i have meet they people like mary annie and edward davis of nashua new hampshire all over this country they can not even buy medicine so let us be careful when we talk about cut health care cost let us start with the insurance company and the people that be make a killing instead of make our people healthy

 mr. lehrer one minute president bush

 president bush well first place i would like to clear up something because every 4 year the democrats go around and say hey republicans be go to cut social security and medicare they have start it again i be the president that stand up and say do not mess with social security and i be not go to and we have not we be not go to go after the social security recipient i have one difference with mr. perot on that because i do not think we need to touch social security

 what we do need to do though be control the growth of these mandatory program and ross properly say okay there be some pain in that but governor clinton refuse to touch that simply refuse so what we have get to do be control it the growth let it grow for inflation let it grow for the amount of new people add population and then hold the line i believe that be the way you get the deficit down not by the tax and spend program that we hear every 4 year whether it be mondale dukakis whoever else it be i just do not believe we ought to do that so hold the line on social security and put a cap on the growth of the mandatory program

 mr. lehrer new question it be for governor clinton 2 minute answer sandy will ask it

 health care costs

 mr. vanocur governor clinton ann compton have bring up medicare i remember in 1965 when wilbur mills of arkansas the chairman of ways and means be push it through the congress the charge against it be it be socialize medicine one you never

 governor clinton mr. bush make that charge

 mr. vanocur well he serve with he 2 year later in 1967 where i first meet he the second point though be that it be now skyrocket out of control people want it we say it be go bonker be not the oregon plan apply to medicaid rationing the proper way to go even though the federal government last august rule that violate the americans with disabilities act of 1990

 governor clinton i think the oregon plan should at least have be allow to be try because at least the people in oregon be try to do something

 let i go back to the main point sandy mr. bush be try to run against lyndon johnson and jimmy carter and everybody in the world but i in this race i have propose a manage competition plan for health care i will say again you can not control health care cost simply by cut medicare look what be happen the federal government have cut medicare and medicaid in the last few year state have cut medicaid we have do it in arkansas under budget pressure but what happen more and more people get on the roll as poverty increase if you do not control the health care cost of the entire system you can not get control of it

 look at our program we have set up a national ceiling on health care cost tie to inflation and population growth set by health care provider not by the government we provide for manage competition not government model in every state and we control private and public health care cost

 now just a few day ago a bipartisan commission of republicans and democrats more republicans than democrats say my plan will save the average family $ 1,200 a year more than the bush plan will by the year 2000 $ 2.2 trillion in the next 12 year $ 400 billion a year by the end of this decade i have get a plan to control health care cost but you can not just do it by cut medicare you have to take on the insurance company the bureaucracy and you have to have cost control yes but keep in mind we be spend 30 percent more on health care than any country in the world any other country yet we have 35 million people uninsured we have no preventive and primary care the oregon plan be a good start if the federal government be go to continue to abandon its responsibility

 i say if germany can cover everybody and keep cost under inflation if hawaii can cover 98 percent of their people at low health care cost than the rest of we if rochester new york can do it with two third of the cost of the rest of we america can do it too i be try of be tell we can not i say we can we can do well and we must

 mr. lehrer president bush one minute

 president bush well i do not have time in 30 second or one minute to talk about our health care reform plan the oregon plan make some good sense but it be easy to dismiss the concern of the disabled as president i have to be sure that those waiver which we be approve all over the place be cover under the law maybe we can work it out but the americans for disabilities act speak about sound and sensible civil right legislation be the foremost piece of legislation pass in modern time so we do have something more than a technical problem

 governor clinton click off the thing you have get to take on insurance company and bureaucracy he fail to take on somebody else the malpractice suit people those that bring these lawsuit against these frivolous trial lawyer lawsuit that be run cost of medical care up by $ 25 billion to $ 50 billion he refuse to put anything control on these crazy lawsuit

 if you want to help somebody do not run the cost up by make doctor have to have five or six test where one would do for fear of be sue or have somebody along the highway not stop to pick up a guy and help he because he be afraid a trial lawyer will come along and sue he we be sue each other too much and care for each other too little

 mr. lehrer mr. perot one minute

 mr. perot we have get the most expensive health care system in the world it rank behind 15 other nation when we come to life expectancy and 22 other nation when we come to infant mortality so we do not have the good pretty simple folk if you be pay more and you do not have the good if all else fail go copy the people who have the good who spend less right but we can do well than that again we have get plan lie all over the place in washington nobody ever implement they

 now i be back to square one if you want to stop talk about it and do it then i will be glad to go up there and we will get it do but if you just want to keep the music go just stay traditional this next time around and 4 year from now you will have everybody blame everybody else for a bad health care system talk be cheap word be plentiful deed be precious let us get on with it

 mr. lehrer and that be exactly what we be go to do that be in fact the final question and answer we be now go to move to closing statement each candidate will have up to 2 minute the order remember be determine by a drawing and mr. perot you be first

 when you go to bed tonight look at your child think of their dream think of your dream as a child and ask yourself be not it time to stop talk about it be not it time to stop create image be not it time to do it be not you sick of be treat like an unprogrammed robot every 4 year they send you all kind of message to tell you how to vote and then go back to business as usual they tell you at the tax and budget summit that if you agree to a tax increase we could balance the budget they do not tell you that that same year they increase spend $ 1.83 for every dollar we increase taxis that be washington in a nutshell right there

 mr. lehrer president bush your closing statement

 president bush well let i tell you a little what it be like to be president in the oval office you can not predict what kind of crisis be go to come up you have to make tough call you can not be on one hand this way and one hand another you can not take different position on these difficult issue

 then you need a philosophical i would call it a philosophical underpinning mine for foreign affair be democracy and freedom look at the dramatic change around the world the cold war be over the soviet union be no more and we be work with a democratic country poland hungary czechoslovakia the baltics be free take a look at the middle east we have to stand up against a tyrant the united states come together as we have not in many many year we kick this man out of kuwait in the process as a result of that will and that decision and that toughness we now have ancient enemy talk peace in the middle east nobody would have dream it possible

 i think the big dividend of make these tough call be the fact that we be less afraid of nuclear war every parent out there have much less worry that their kid be go to be face with nuclear holocaust all this be good

 on the domestic side what we must do be have change that empower people not change for the sake of change tax and spend we do not need to do that anymore what we need to do be empower people we need to invest and save we need to do well in education we need to do well in job retraining we need to expand our export and they be go very very well indeed we need to strengthen the american family

 i hope as president that i have earn your trust i have admit it when i make a mistake but then i go on and help try to solve the problem i hope i have earn your trust because a lot of be president be about trust and character and i ask for your support for 4 more year to finish this job

 mr. lehrer do not go away yet i just want to thank the three panelist and thank the three candidate for participate president bush governor clinton and mr. perot they will appear again together on october the 15th and again on october 19th next tuesday there will be a debate among the three candidate for vice president

 and for now from washington university in st. louis missouri i be jim lehrer thank you and good night

i want to talk to you today about the tragedy in somalia and about a mission that can ease suffering and save life every american have see the shocking image from somalia the scope of suffer there be hard to imagine already over a quarter million people as many people as live in buffalo new york have die in the somali famine in the month ahead 5 time that number 1 1/2 million people could starve to death
 for many month now the united states have be actively engage in the massive international relief effort to ease somalia 's suffering all tell america have send somalia 200,000 ton of food more than half the world total this summer the distribution system break down truck convoy from somalia 's port be block sufficient food fail to reach the starving in the interior of somalia
 so in august we take additional action in concert with the united nations we send in the u.s. air force to help fly food to the town to date american pilot have fly over 1,400 flight deliver over 17,000 ton of food aid and when the u.n. authorize 3,500 u.n. guard to protect the relief operation we fly in the first of they 500 soldier from pakistan
 but in the month since then the security situation have grow bad the u.n. have be prevent from deploy its initial commitment of troop in many case food from relief flight be be loot upon landing food convoy have be hijack aid worker assault ship with food have be subject to artillery attack that prevent they from dock there be no government in somalia law and order have break down anarchy prevail
 one image tell the story imagine 7,000 ton of food aid literally burst out of a warehouse on a dock in mogadishu while somalis starve less than a kilometer away because relief worker can not run the gauntlet of armed gang rove the city confront with these condition relief group call for outside troop to provide security so they could feed people it be now clear that military support be necessary to ensure the safe delivery of the food somalis need to survive
 it be this situation which lead we to tell the united nations that the united states would be willing to provide more help to enable relief to be deliver last night the united nations security council by unanimous vote and after the tireless effort of secretary general boutros ghali welcome the united states offer to lead a coalition to get the food through
 after consult with my adviser with world leader and the congressional leadership i have today tell secretary general boutros ghali that america will answer the call i have give the order to secretary cheney to move a substantial american force into somalia as i speak a marine amphibious ready group which we maintain at sea be offshore mogadishu these troop will be join by element of the 1st marine expeditionary force base out of camp pendleton california and by the army 's 10th mountain division out of fort drum new york these and other american force will assist in operation restore hope they be america 's fine they will perform this mission with courage and compassion and they will succeed
 the people of somalia especially the child of somalia need our help we be able to ease their suffering we must help they live we must give they hope america must act
 in take this action i want to emphasize that i understand the united states alone can not right the world 's wrong but we also know that some crisis in the world can not be resolve without american involvement that american action be often necessary as a catalyst for broad involvement of the community of nation only the united states have the global reach to place a large security force on the ground in such a distant place quickly and efficiently and thus save thousand of innocent from death
 we will not however be act alone i expect force from about a dozen country to join we in this mission when we see somalia 's child starve all of america hurt we have try to help in many way and make no mistake about it now we and our ally will ensure that aid get through here be what we and our coalition partner will do
 first we will create a secure environment in the hard hit part of somalia so that food can move from ship over land to the people in the countryside now devastate by starvation
 second once we have create that secure environment we will withdraw our troop hand the security mission back to a regular u.n. peacekeeping force our mission have a limited objective to open the supply route to get the food move and to prepare the way for a u.n. peacekeeping force to keep it move this operation be not open ended we will not stay one day long than be absolutely necessary
 let i be very clear our mission be humanitarian but we will not tolerate armed gang rip off their own people condemn they to death by starvation general hoar and his troop have the authority to take whatever military action be necessary to safeguard the life of our troop and the life of somalia 's people the outlaw element in somalia must understand this be serious business we will accomplish our mission we have no intent to remain in somalia with fight force but we be determined to do it right to secure an environment that will allow food to get to the starve people of somalia
 to the people of somalia i promise this we do not plan to dictate political outcome we respect your sovereignty and independence base on my conversation with other coalition leader i can state with confidence we come to your country for one reason only to enable the starving to be feed
 let i say to the man and woman of our armed forces we be ask you to do a difficult and dangerous job as commander in chief i assure you you will have our full support to get the job do and we will bring you home as soon as possible
 finally let i close with a message to the family of the man and woman who take part in this mission i understand it be difficult to see your love one go to send they off know they will not be home for the holiday but the humanitarian mission they undertake be in the fine tradition of service so to every sailor soldier airman and marine who be involve in this mission let i say you be do god 's work we will not fail
 thank you and may god bless the united states of america

thank you all for that welcome back thank you very very much good afternoon everybody and thank you all i know if i wear this necktie i would get a nice welcome but anyway thank you dr. mobley thank you bill for your kind introduction

 i want to say thank to my host the memorial student center political forum when that forum start i think congressman bob eckhardt and i be the first two speaker to speak at the political forum i would hate to tell you how far back that be but anyway i be glad to be back here and may i send my heartiest thank to the corp of cadet and the fightin texas aggies band over here
 as i tell bill mobley and ross early on a personal note i be look forward to spend more time here to actively participate in our presidential library that will be build here to help with the school of public service that will be part of that library and barbara and i be both look forward to be part of the a&amp;m family thank you very much
 now for the business at hand in 36 day i will hand over the stewardship of this great nation cap a career in public service that begin 50 year ago in wartime sky over the pacific and our country win that great contest but enter an uneasy peace you see the fire of world war ii cool into a long cold war one that freeze the world into two oppose camp on the one side america and its ally and on the other—[applause]—the force of freedom thus against an alien ideology that cast its shadow over every american
 three year ago when i be honor to address the graduating class here at texas a&amp;m i speak of the need to move beyond containment and i say we seek the integration of the soviet union into the community of nation ultimately our objective be to welcome the soviet union back into the world order and be this aim too ambitious not for the american people
 today by the grit of our people and the grace of god the cold war be over freedom have carry the day and i leave the white house grateful for what we have achieve together and also exhilarate by the promise of what can come to pass
 this afternoon i would like to just share some of my thought on the past few year and on america 's purpose in the world my thesis be a simple one amid the triumph and the tumult of the recent past one truth ring out more clearly than ever america remain today what lincoln say it be more than a century ago the last good hope of man on earth this be a fact a truth make indelible by the struggle and the agony of the 20th century and in the sacrifice symbolize by each tower oak on simpson drill field here at texas a&amp;m university the leadership the power and yes the conscience of the united states of america all be essential for a peaceful prosperous international order just as such an order be essential for we
 history 's lesson be clear when a war weary america withdraw from the international stage follow world war i the world spawn militarism fascism and aggression unchecked plunge mankind into another devastating conflict but in answer the call to lead after world war ii we build from the principle of democracy and the rule of law a new community of free nation a community whose strength perseverance patience and unity of purpose contain soviet totalitarianism and keep the peace
 in the end soviet communism provide no match for free enterprise beyond its border or the yearning for liberty within they and the american leadership that undermine the confidence and capacity of the communist regime become a beacon for all the people of the world
 steadfast and sure generation of americans stand in the path of the soviet advance while our adversary probe for weakness that be never find president from both party lead an atlantic alliance hold together by the bond of principle and love of liberty face a warsaw pact lash together by occupation troop and quisle government and when all else fail the use of tank against its own people by the 1980 's kremlin leader find that our alliance would not crack when they threaten america 's ally with the infamous ss-20 nuclear missile nor do the alliance shrink from the deployment of countervail missile to defend against this menace
 in the pacific too we build a new alliance with japan defend korea and call hundred of thousand of americans to sacrifice in the jungle of southeast asia
 the american people demonstrate that they would shoulder whatever defense burden make whatever sacrifice be need to assure our freedom and protect our ally and interest and we make use of this superb technology that our free enterprise system have produce and having learn that they could not divide our alliance the soviets eventually be force to realize that their command economy simply could not compete as the soviet system stall and crumble so too do the ability of its ruler to deny their people the truth about we and about they
 in the end soviet communism be destroy by its own internal contradiction new leader with new vision face the hard truth that their predecessor have long deny glasnost perestroika they may have be russian word but the concept at their core be universal
 the soviet union do not simply lose the cold war the western democracy win it i say this not to gloat but to make a key point the quality that enable we to triumph in that struggle faith strength unity and above all american leadership be those we must call upon now to win the peace
 in recent year with the soviet empire in its death throe the potential for crisis and conflict be never great the demand for american leadership never more compelling as the people of eastern europe make their bold move for freedom we urge they along a peaceful path to liberation they turn to we they turn to america and we do not turn away and when our german friend take their hammer to tear down that wall we encourage a united germany safely within the nato alliance they look to america and we do not look away and when the people of russia block the tank that try to roll back the tide of history america do not walk away
 i can remember speak to boris yeltsin at that terrible moment of crisis at time the static on the telephone make it almost impossible to hear he but there be no mistaking what he want to know he ask where the united states of america stand and america answer for all the world to hear we stand with you
 boris yeltsin to this day have not forget praise our country on his visit to the white house this june he say george bush be the first to understand the true scope and meaning of the victory of the russian people on august 19 1991 he address i but he be talk about our country the united states of america
 the free people of the world watch they watch in awe as the soviet union collapse but they hold their breath at what might take its place wonder who might control its ten of thousand of nuclear weapon only america could manage that danger we act decisively to help the new leader reduce their arsenal and gain firm control of those that remain
 here then be the remarkable fact that history will record a fact that will be study for year in the library right here at texas a&amp;m university the end of a titanic clash of political system the collapse of the most heavily armed empire in history take place without a shot be fire that should be a source of pride for every american
 from the day after world war ii when fragile european democracy be threaten by stalin 's expansionism to the last day of the cold war as our foe become fragile democracy themselves american leadership have be indispensable no one person deserve credit for this america do it have be achieve because of what we as a people stand for and what we be make of
 yes we answer the call and we triumph but today we be summon again this time we be call not to wage a war hot or cold but to win the democratic peace not for half a world as before but for people the world over the end of the cold war you see have place in our hand a unique opportunity to see the principle for which america have stand for two century democracy free enterprise and the rule of law spread more widely than ever before in human history
 for the first time turn this global vision into a new and well world be indeed a realistic possibility it be a hope that embody our country 's tradition of idealism which have make we unique among nation and uniquely successful and our vision be not mere utopianism the advance of democratic ideal reflect a hard nosed sense of our own of american self interest for certain truth have indeed now become evident government responsive to the will of the people be not likely to commit aggression they be not likely to sponsor terrorism or to threaten humanity with weapon of mass destruction likewise the global spread of free market by encourage trade investment and growth will sustain the expansion of american prosperity in short by help other we help ourselves
 some will dismiss this vision as no more than a dream i ask they to consider the last 4 year when a dozen dream be make real the berlin wall demolish and germany unite the captive nation set free russia democratic whole class of nuclear weapon eliminate the rest vastly reduce many nation unite in our historic u.n. coalition to turn back a tyrant in the persian gulf israel and its arab neighbor for the first time talk peace face to face in a region that have know so much war each of these once seem a dream today they be concrete reality bring about by a common cause the patient and judicious application of american leadership american power and perhaps most of all american moral force
 without a doubt there be go to be serious obstacle and setback ahead you know and i know that we face some already violence poverty ethnic and religious hatred will be powerful adversary and overcome they be go to take time and it be go to take tenacity courage and commitment but i be absolutely convinced that they can be overcome
 look to europe where nation after century of war transform themselves into a peaceful progressive community no society no continent should be disqualify from share the ideal of human liberty the community of democratic nation be more robust then ever and it will gain strength as it grow by work with our ally by invigorate our international institution america do not have to stand alone
 yet from some quarter we hear voice sound the retreat we have carry the burden too long they say and the disappearance of the soviet challenge mean that america can withdraw from international responsibility and then other assert that domestic need preclude an active foreign policy that we have do our part now it be someone else 's turn we be warn against entangle ourselves in the trouble that abound in today 's world to name only a few clan warfare mass starvation in somalia savage violence in bosnia instability in the former soviet union the alarming growth of virulent nationalism
 it be true these problem some freeze by the cold war other hold in check by communist repression seem to have ignite all at once tax the world 's ability to respond but let us be clear the alternative to american leadership be not more security for our citizen but less not the flourish of american principle but their isolation in a world actively hold hostile to they
 destiny it have be say be not a matter of chance it be a matter of choice it be not a thing to be wait for it be a thing to be achieve and we can never safely assume that our future will be an improvement over the past our choice as a people be simple we can either shape our time or we can let the time shape we and shape we they will at a price frightening to contemplate morally economically and strategically
 morally a failure to respond to massive human catastrophe like that in somalia would scar the soul of our nation there can be no single or simple set of guideline for foreign policy we should help but we should consider use military force only in those situation where the stake warrant where it can be effective and its application limit in scope and time as we seek to save life we must always be mindful of the life that we may have to put at risk
 economically a world of escalate instability and hostile nationalism will disrupt global market set off trade war set we on a path of economic decline american job would be lose our chance to compete would be block and our very well being would be undermine
 strategically abandonment of the worldwide democratic revolution could be disastrous for american security the alternative to democracy i think we would all agree be authoritarianism regime that can be repressive xenophobic aggressive and violent and in a world where despite u.s. effort weapon of mass destruction be spread the collapse of the democratic revolution could pose a direct threat to the safety of every single american
 the new world could in time be as menacing as the old and let i be blunt a retreat from american leadership from american involvement would be a mistake for which future generation indeed our own child would pay dearly
 but we can influence the future we can rededicate ourselves to the hard work of freedom and this do not mean run off on reckless expensive crusade it do not mean bear the world 's burden all alone but it do mean leadership economic political and yes military when our interest and value be at risk and where we can make a difference and when we place our young man and woman of the military in harm 's way we must be able to assure they and their family that their mission be define and that its success can be achieve
 it seem like age ago that the people of germany tear down that wall but it be be only 3 year and just over a year since the august coup be defeat by brave russian democrat and in this brief time we have embark on a new course through uncharted water the united states and its friend old and new have begin to define the post cold war reality and we be already transform the old network of alliance institution and regime to face the future and those challenge must be meet with collective action lead by the united states to protect and promote our political economic and security value
 our foundation must be the democratic community that win the cold war and we have begin to adapt america 's political economic and defense relationship with europe and japan to ensure their vitality and strength in this new era for these will continue to be essential partner in address the next generation of problem and opportunity
 for example we have begin to transform the atlantic alliance that bulwark against the soviet threat into a partnership with a more united europe a partnership prime to meet new security challenge in this age of uncertainty and a new feature of our alliance the north atlantic cooperation council enable nato to reach out to our former adversary in the warsaw pact
 in the pacific we have affirm the importance of the u.s.-japan security tie to stability in asia but we be also explore way to work together as global partner to address common interest in economic development and regional problem
 then we have commit ourselves to expand the democratic community by support political and economic freedom in nascent democracy and market economy and we be share this burden with the very nation america help after world war ii
 look in central and eastern europe our enterprise fund and these other program have help develop a new political economic and civic infrastructure for nation long oppress by stalin 's legacy and now the freedom support act will provide crucial help for reform in the land of our former enemy
 in latin america the day of the dictator have give way to the dawn of democracy this very day our vice president be take part in a ceremony in el salvador that cap the long effort to end the killing and give the people there the opportunity to live in peace
 throughout the region economic initiative be help a new generation of leader reform their society the brady plan and our enterprise for the americas initiative have open up extraordinary possibility for a new relationship with our hemispheric neighbor investment free trade debt relief and environmental protection will nurture the homegrown reform throughout latin america
 we be strengthen the ability of the democratic community to deal with the political landmine that the cold war have expose aggressive nationalism early i mention ethnic conflict civil war and humanitarian crisis the united states have lead the world in support a united nations more capable with deal with these crisis
 all over the world nicaragua namibia angola cambodia we have promote election not only as a goal but as a tool a device for resolve conflict and establish political legitimacy
 one of vital interest to every young person in the area of security and arm control we have step up patrol against the spread of weapon of mass destruction the new chemical weapon convention will ban chemical weapon from the arsenal of all participate state we have strengthen multilateral export control on nuclear and chemical and biological and missile relate technology and in a mission without precedent a u.n. inspection team be demolish iraq 's unconventional weapon capability and we be go to support they every inch of the way and once implement the agreement we have negotiate will ban new nuclear state on the territory of the former soviet union and above all we have seek to erase nuclear nightmare from the sleep of future generation
 we underscore one key security principle with a line in the sand naked aggression against our vital interest will be answer decisively by american resolve american leadership and american might our victory in the gulf in the persian gulf be more than a blow for justice it be a reminder to other would be aggressor that they will pay a price for their outlaw act
 we have be commit to build the basis for sustained international economic growth for ourselves and for those nation of what be once the so call second and third world the heart of our effort have be the creation of a strong and free international trading market
 our recent breakthrough with the european community clear the way for an early conclusion to the uruguay round of gatt and a major boost to world economic recovery this week mexico canada and the united states will sign a landmark agreement establish the large free trade zone the world have ever see and our effort to forge a new mechanism for asia pacific economic cooperation confirm america 's commitment to remain an economic and security power in asia
 i believe we have take important step toward a world in which democracy be the norm in which private enterprise free trade and prosperity enrich every region a world in which the rule of law prevail we must not stumble as we travel toward a world without the brutal violence of bosnia the deadly anarchy of somalia or the squalor that still haunt so much of the globe we can not rest while a handful of renegade regime aspire to obtain weapon of mass destruction with which to threaten their neighbor or even america there be much to be do before we be within reach of the democratic peace but these first step have take we in that right direction
 the challenge ahead then be as great as the one we face at the end of the last great war but the opportunity be vastly great success will require american vision and resolve an america secure in its military moral and economic strength success will require unity of purpose a commitment on the part of all our people to the proposition that our nation 's destiny lie in the hope of a well world a new world make well with our friend and ally again by american leadership

thank you all very much good luck please be seat thank you general graves for that very kind introduction barbara and i be just delighted to be here and honor that we could be join by our able secretary of the army mike stone of course the man well know here that head our army general sullivan general gordon sullivan and gracie graves general robert foley general galloway shawn daniel well know to everybody here be our host in a sense and a west point alum who have be at my side for 4 year over here somewhere general scowcroft graduate of this great institution who serve his country with such distinction may i salute the member of the board of visitors i see another i have to single out general galvin who serve his country with such honor and of course save the good for last the corps of cadets thank you for that welcome
 let i begin with the hard part it be difficult for a navy person to come up to west point after that game a month ago go ahead rub it in but i watch it amazing thing can happen in sport look at the oilers my other team that take it on the chin the other day
 but i guess the moral of all of this be that lose be never easy trust i i know something about that laughter but if you have to lose that be the way to do it fight with all you have give it your good shot and win or lose learn from it and get on with life
 i be about to get on with the rest of my life but before i do i want to share with you at this institution of leadership some of my thinking both about the world you will soon be call upon to enter and the life that you have choose
 any president have several function he speak for and to the nation he must faithfully execute the law and he must lead but no function none of the president 's hat in my view be more important than his role as commander in chief for it be as commander in chief that the president confront and make decision that one way or another affect the life of everyone in this country as well as many other around the world
 i have have many occasion to don this most important of hat over the past 4 year the man and woman who proudly and bravely wear the uniform of the u.s. armed service have be call upon to go in harm 's way and have discharge their duty with honor and professionalism
 i wish i could say that such demand be a thing of the past that with the end of the cold war the call upon the united states would diminish i can not yes the end of the cold war we would all concede be a blessing it be a time of great promise democratic government have never be so numerous what happen 2 or 3 day ago in moscow would not have be possible in the cold war day thank to historic treaty such as that start ii pact just reach with russia the likelihood of nuclear holocaust be vastly diminish
 but this do not mean that there be no specter of war no threat to be reckon with and already we see disturb sign of what this new world could become if we be passive and aloof we would risk the emergence of a world characterize by violence characterize by chaos one in which dictator and tyrant threaten their neighbor build arsenal brim with weapon of mass destruction and ignore the welfare of their own man woman and child and we could see a horrible increase in international terrorism with american citizen more at risk than ever before
 we can not and we need not allow this to happen our objective must be to exploit the unparalleled opportunity present by the cold war 's end to work toward transform this new world into a new world order one of government that be democratic tolerant and economically free at home and commit abroad to settle inevitable difference peacefully without the threat or use of force
 unfortunately not everyone subscribe to these principle we continue to see leader bent on deny fundamental human right and seize territory regardless of the human cost no an international society one more attuned to the endure principle that have make this country a beacon of hope for so many for so long will not just emerge on its own it be get to be build
 two hundred year ago another depart president warn of the danger of what he describe as entangle alliance his be the right course for a new nation at that point in history but what be entangle in washington 's day be now essential this be why at texas a&amp;m a few week ago i speak of the folly of isolationism and of the importance morally economically and strategically of the united states remain involve in world affair we must engage ourselves if a new world order one more compatible with our value and congenial to our interest be to emerge but even more we must lead
 leadership well it take many form it can be political or diplomatic it can be economic or military it can be moral or spiritual leadership leadership can take any one of these form or it can be a combination of they
 leadership should not be confuse with either unilateralism or universalism we need not respond by ourselves to each and every outrage of violence the fact that america can act do not mean that it must a nation 's sense of idealism need not be at odd with its interest nor do principle displace prudence
 no the united states should not seek to be the world 's policeman there be no support abroad or at home for we to play this role nor should there be we would exhaust ourselves in the process waste precious resource need to address those problem at home and abroad that we can not afford to ignore
 but in the wake of the cold war in a world where we be the only remain superpower it be the role of the united states to marshal its moral and material resource to promote a democratic peace it be our responsibility it be our opportunity to lead there be no one else
 leadership can not be simply assert or demand it must be demonstrate leadership require formulate worthy goal persuade other of their virtue and contribute one 's share of the common effort and then some leadership take time it take patience it take work
 some of this work must take place here at home congress do have a constitutional role to play leadership therefore also involve work with the congress and the american people to provide the essential domestic underpinning if u.s. military commitment be to be sustainable
 this be what our administration the bush administration have try to do when saddam hussein invade kuwait it be the united states that galvanize the u.n. security council to act and then mobilize the successful coalition on the battlefield the pattern not exactly the same but similar in somalia first the united states underscore the importance of alleviate the grow tragedy and then we organize humanitarian effort design to bring hope food and peace
 at time real leadership require a willingness to use military force and force can be a useful backdrop to diplomacy a complement to it or if need be a temporary alternative
 as commander in chief i have make the difficult choice to use military force i determine we could not allow saddam 's force to ravage kuwait and hold this critical region at gunpoint i think then and i think now that use military force to implement the resolution of the u.n. security council be in the interest of the united states and the world community the need to use force arise as well in the wake of the gulf war when we come to the aid of the people of both northern and southern iraq and more recently as i be sure you know i determine that only the use of force could stem this human tragedy of somalia
 the united states should not stand by with so many life at stake and when a limited deployment of u.s. force buttress by the force of other country and act under the full authority of the united nations could make an immediate and dramatic difference and do so without excessive level of risk and cost operation provide comfort and southern watch in iraq and then operation restore hope in somalia all bear witness to the wisdom of select use of force for selective purpose
 sometimes the decision not to use force to stay our hand i can tell you it be just as difficult as the decision to send our soldier into battle the former yugoslavia well it be be such a situation there be we all know important humanitarian and strategic interest at stake there but up to now it be not be clear that the application of limited amount of force by the united states and its traditional friend and ally would have have the desire effect give the nature and complexity of that situation
 our assessment of the situation in the former yugoslavia could well change if and as the situation change the stake could grow the conflict could threaten to spread indeed we be constantly reassess our option and be actively consult with other about step that might be take to contain the fighting protect the humanitarian effort and deny serbia the fruit of aggression
 military force be never a tool to be use lightly or universally in some circumstance it may be essential in other counterproductive i know that many people would like to find some formula some easy formula to apply to tell we with precision when and where to intervene with force anyone look for scientific certitude be in for a disappointment in the complex new world we be enter there can be no single or simple set of fix rule for use force inevitably the question of military intervention require judgment each and every case be unique to adopt rigid criterion would guarantee mistake involve american interest and american life and it would give would be troublemaker a blueprint for determine their own action it could signal u.s. friend and ally that our support be not to be count on
 similarly we can not always decide in advance which interest will require our use military force to protect they the relative importance of an interest be not a guide military force may not be the good way of safeguard something vital while use force might be the good way to protect an interest that qualify as important but less than vital
 but to warn against a futile quest for a set of hard and fast rule to govern the use of military force be not to say there can not be some principle to inform our decision such guideline can prove useful in size and indeed shape our force and in help we to think our way through this key question
 use military force make sense as a policy where the stake warrant where and when force can be effective where no other policy be likely to prove effective where its application can be limit in scope and time and where the potential benefit justify the potential cost and sacrifice
 once we be satisfied that force make sense we must act with the maximum possible support the united states can and should lead but we will want to act in concert where possible involve the united nations or other multinational grouping the united states can and should contribute to the common undertaking in a manner commensurate with our wealth with our strength but other should also contribute militarily be it by provide combat or support force access to facility or basis or overflight right and similarly other should contribute economically it be unreasonable to expect the united states to bear the full financial burden of intervention when other nation have a stake in the outcome
 a desire for international support must not become a prerequisite for act though sometimes a great power have to act alone i make a tough decision i might say on advice of our outstanding military leader who be so well known to everybody here to use military force in panama when american life and the security of the canal appear to be threaten by outlaw who steal power in the face of free election and similarly we move swiftly to safeguard democracy in the philippines
 but in every case involve the use of force it will be essential to have a clear and achievable mission a realistic plan for accomplish the mission and criterion no less realistic for withdraw u.s. force once the mission be complete only if we keep these principle in mind will the potential sacrifice be one that can be explain and justify we must never forget that use force be not some political abstraction but a real commitment of our father and mother and son and daughter brother and sister friend and neighbor you have get to look at it in human term
 in order even to have the choice we must have available adequate military force tailor for a wide range of contingency include peacekeeping indeed lead the effort toward a new world order will require a modern capable military in some area necessitate more rather than less defense spending as president i have say that my ability to deploy force on behalf of u.s. interest abroad be make possible because past president and i would single out in particular my predecessor ronald reagan and past secretaries of defense sustain a strong military consistent with this sacred trust i be proud to pass on to my successor president elect clinton a military second to none we have the very good
 yet it be essential to recognize that as important as such factor be any military be more than simply the sum of its weapon or the state of its technology what make any armed force truly effective be the quality of its leadership the quality of its training the quality of its people
 we have succeed abroad in no small part because of our people in uniform the man and woman in our armed forces have demonstrate their ability to master the challenge of modern warfare and at the same time and whether on the battlefield of iraq or in some tiny little village in somalia america 's soldier have always bring a quality of caring and kindness to their mission who will ever forget i know i won't those terrify iraqi soldier surrender to american troop and who will forget the way the american soldier hold out his arm and say it be okay you be all right now or in somalia the young marine eye fill with tear hold the fragile arm of an emaciated child there can be no doubt about it the all volunteer force be one of the true success story of modern day america
 it be instructive to look at just why this be so at its heart a voluntary military be base upon choice you all know that the decision freely take by young man and woman to join the decision by more mature man and woman to remain and the institution of the armed forces have thrive on its commitment to develop and promote excellence it be meritocracy in action race religion wealth background count not indeed the military offer many example for the rest of society show what can be do to eradicate the scourge of drug to break down the barrier of racial discrimination to offer equal opportunity to woman
 this be not just a result of self selection it also reflect the military 's commitment to education and training you know people speak of defense conversion the process by which the defense firm retool for civilian task well defense conversion within the military have be go on for year it be the constant process of training and retraining which the military do so well that allow individual to keep up with the late technology take on more challenging assignment and prepare for life on the outside
 out of this culture of merit and competition have emerge hundred of thousand of highly skilled man and woman brim with real self confidence what they possess be a special mix of discipline a willingness to accept direction and the confidence a willingness to accept responsibility together discipline and confidence provide the basis for win for get the job do
 there be no high calling no more honorable choice than the one that you here today have make to join the armed forces be to be prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for your country and for your fellow man
 what you have do what you be do send an important message one that i fear sometimes get lose amidst today 's often materialist self interested culture it be important to remember it be important to demonstrate that there be a high purpose to life beyond one 's self now i speak of family of community of ideal i speak of duty honor country
 there be many form of contribute to this country of public service yes there be government there be voluntarism i love to talk about the thousand point of light one american help another the daily task that require do in our classroom in our hospital our city our farm all can and do represent a form of service in whatever form service benefit our society and it ennoble the giver it be a cherished american concept one we should continue to practice and pass on to our child
 this be what i want to share on this occasion you be begin your service to country and i be near the end of mine exactly half a century ago in june of 1942 as general graves mention we be at war and i be graduate from school the speaker that day at andover be the then secretary of war henry stimson and his message be one of public service but with a twist on the importance of finish one 's schooling before go off to fight for one 's country i listen closely to what he have to say but i do not take his advice and that day be my 18th birthday and when the commencement ceremony end i go on into boston and enlist in the navy as a seaman 2d class and i never regret it
 you too have sign up you too will never regret it and i salute you for it fortunately because of the sacrifice make in year before and still be make you should be able to complete this phase of your education
 a half century have pass since i leave school to go into the service a half century have pass since that day when stimson speak of the challenge of create a new world you will also be enter a new world one far well than the one i come to know a world with the potential to be far well yet this be the challenge this be the opportunity of your lifetime i envy you for it and i wish you godspeed and while i be at it as your commander in chief i hereby grant amnesty to the corps of cadets
 thank you all very much thank you thank you very very much good luck to all of you warm up here good luck to you guy thank you

 to renew america we must revitalize our democracy this beautiful capital like every capital since the dawn of civilization be often a place of intrigue and calculation powerful people maneuver for position and worry endlessly about who be in and who be out who be up and who be down forget those people whose toil and sweat send we here and pay our way americans deserve well and in this city today there be people who want to do well and so i say to all of you here let we resolve to reform our politic so that power and privilege no long shout down the voice of the people let we put aside personal advantage so that we can feel the pain and see the promise of america let we resolve to make our government a place for what franklin roosevelt call bold persistent experimentation a government for our tomorrow not our yesterday let we give this capital back to the people to whom it belong
 to renew america we must meet challenge abroad as well as at home there be no long a clear division between what be foreign and what be domestic the world economy the world environment the world aids crisis the world arm race they affect we all today as an old order pass the new world be more free but less stable communism 's collapse have call forth old animosity and new danger clearly america must continue to lead the world we do so much to make

 my fellow americans you too must play your part in our renewal i challenge a new generation of young americans to a season of service to act on your idealism by help troubled child keep company with those in need reconnecte our torn community there be so much to be do enough indeed for million of other who be still young in spirit to give of themselves in service too in serve we recognize a simple but powerful truth we need each other and we must care for one another
 today we do more than celebrate america we rededicate ourselves to the very idea of america an idea bear in revolution and renew through two century of challenge an idea temper by the knowledge that but for fate we the fortunate and the unfortunate might have be each other an idea ennoble by the faith that our nation can summon from its myriad diversity the deep measure of unity an idea infuse with the conviction that america 's long heroic journey must go forever upward

 thank you and god bless you all

the president good afternoon lady and gentleman i be sorry we have a last minute delay occasion by another issue not this one
 the debate over whether to lift the ban on homosexual in the military have to put it mildly spark a great deal of interest over the last few day today as you know i have reach an agreement at least with senator nunn and senator mitchell about how we will proceed in the next few day but first i would like to explain what i believe about this issue and why and what i have decide to do after a long conversation and a very good one with the joint chiefs of staff and discussion with several member of congress
 the issue be not whether there should be homosexual in the military everyone concede that there be the issue be whether man and woman who can and have serve with real distinction should be exclude from military service solely on the basis of their status and i believe they should not
 the principle on which i base this position be this i believe that american citizen who want to serve their country should be able to do so unless their conduct disqualify they from do so military life be fundamentally different from civilian society it necessarily have a different and strict code of conduct even a different code of justice nonetheless individual who be prepared to accept all necessary restriction on their behavior many of which would be intolerable in civilian society should be able to serve their country honorably and well
 i have ask the secretary of defense to submit by july the 15th a draft executive order after full consultation with military and congressional leader and concerned individual outside of the government which would end the present policy of the exclusion from military service solely on the basis of sexual orientation and at the same time establish rigorous standard regard sexual conduct to be apply to all military personnel
 this draft order will be accompany by a study conduct during the next 6 month on the real practical problem that would be involve in this revision of policy so that we will have a practical realistic approach consistent with the high standard of combat effectiveness and unit cohesion that our armed service must maintain i agree with the joint chiefs that the high standard of conduct must be require
 the change can not and should not be accomplish overnight it do require extensive consultation with the joint chiefs expert in the congress and in the legal community join by my administration and other we have consult closely to date and will do so in the future during that process interim measure will be place into effect which i hope again sharpen the focus of this debate the joint chiefs of staff have agree to remove the question regard one 's sexual orientation from future version of the enlistment application and it will not be ask in the interim
 we also all agree that a very high standard of conduct can and must be apply so the single area of disagreement be this should someone be able to serve their country in uniform if they say they be homosexual but they do nothing which violate the code of conduct or undermine unit cohesion or morale apart from that statement that be what all the furor of the last few day have be about and the practical and not insignificant issue raise by that issue be what will be study in the next 6 month
 through this period end july 15th the department of justice will seek continuance in pende court case involve reinstatement and administrative separation under current department of defense policy base on status alone will be stay pende completion of this review the final discharge in case base only on status will be suspend until the president have an opportunity to review and act upon the final recommendation of the secretary of defense with respect to the current policy in the meantime a member whose discharge have be suspend by the attorney general will be separate from active duty and place in standby reserve until the final report of the secretary of defense and the final action of the president this be the agreement that i have reach with senator nunn and senator mitchell
 during this review process i will work with the congress and i believe the compromise announce today by the senators and by i show that we can work together to end the gridlock that have plague our city for too long
 this compromise be not everything i would have hope for or everything that i have stand for but it be plainly a substantial step in the right direction and it will allow we to move forward on other terribly important issue affect far more americans
 my administration come to this city with a mission to bring critical issue of reform and renewal and economic revitalization to the public debate issue that be central to the life of all americans we be work on an economic reform agenda that will begin with an address to the joint session of congress on february 17th in the come month the white house task force on health care chair by the first lady will complete work on a comprehensive health care reform proposal to be submit to congress within 100 day of the commencement of this administration we will be design a system of national service to begin a season of service in which our nation 's unmet need be address and we provide more young people the opportunity to go to college we will be propose comprehensive welfare reform legislation and other important initiative
 i applaud the work that have be do in the last 2 or 3 day by senator nunn senator mitchell and other to enable we to move forward on a principle that be important to i without shut the government down and run the risk of not even address the family and medical leave issue which be so important to america 's family before congress go into its recess i be look forward to get on with this issue over the next 6 month and with these other issue which be so central to the campaign and far more importantly be so important to the life of all the american people
 q. mr. president yesterday a federal court in california say that the military ban on homosexual be unconstitutional will you direct the navy and the justice department not to appeal that decision and how do that ruling strengthen your hand in this case
 the president well it make one point i think it strengthen my hand if you will in two way one i agree with the principle embody in the case i have not read the opinion but as i understand it the opinion draw the distinction that i seek to draw between conduct and status and secondly it make the practical point i have be make all along which be that there be not insignificant chance that this matter would ultimately be resolve in the court in a way that would open admission into the military without the opportunity to deal with this whole range of practical issue which everyone who have ever think about it or talk it through concede be there so i think it can it strengthen my hand on the principle as well as on the process
 q. mr. president there be a glass of water there by the way while i ask the question do you think since you promise during the campaign your literature put out a very clear statement lift the ban on homosexual in the military immediately do you think you do not think through these practical problem what have you learn from this experience in deal with powerful member of the senate and the joint chiefs and how much of a problem be this for you to accept a compromise which do not meet your real goal
 the president well i have not give up on my real goal i think this be a dramatic step forward normally in the history of civil right advancement president have not necessarily be in the forefront in the beginning so i think the fact that we actually have the joint chiefs of staff agree that it be time to take this question off the enlistment form that there ought to be a serious examination of how this would be do even though they have not agree that it should be do that the senate if they vote for the motion advocate by senators nunn and mitchell will agree senator who do not agree that the policy should be change be agree that we ought to have a chance to work through this for 6 month and persuade they of that i think be very very significant
 now i would remind you that any president 's executive order can be overturn by an act of congress the president can then veto the act of congress and try to have his veto sustain if the act stand on its own as a simple issue that could always be veto but i always know that there be a chance that congress would disagree with my position i can only tell you that i still think i be right i feel comfortable about the way we have do this and i be go to maintain the commitment that i have
 q. but do you think that you have not examine the practical problem
 q. sir i just wonder do you think in retrospect that obviously you do not intend the first week i'm sorry you want to
 the president no i have always plan to allow some period of time during which policy would be develop to deal with what i think be the significant practical problem this in effect may reverse the process over what i intend to do but there have to be a time in which these issue these practical issue be develop and policy be develop to deal with they
 q. obviously you do not intend the first week of your administration give your promise to have the laser focus on the economy to be see around the country as military gay right week i wonder if in retrospect you think you could have do thing differently to have avoid that happen
 the president i do not know how i could have do that the joint chiefs ask for a meeting about a number of issue in which this be only one we spend a lot of time talk about other thing this issue be not put forward in this context by i it be put forward by those in the united states senate who seek to make it an issue early on and i do not know how i could have stop they from do that
 q. you do not think that in make the promise and then in promise to follow through on it early that you might have give rise to this do you sir
 the president well i think it be pretty clear to i that we be talk about some sort of 6 month process day and day ago and the people who want it debate now be not deter by that and probably a lot of they will not be deter by the agreement announce today i think that we must they have the perfect right to do this but the timing of this whole issue be clearly force by the people in the senate who be oppose to any change of the policy no matter what the fact be and i think that be their right to do but they control the timing of this not i
 q. two question first of all just to make sure that we be clear on this july 15th this happen period regardless of what come out at these hearing be that correct the ban will be issue or will be lift rather
 the president that be my position my position be that i still embrace the principle and i think it should be do the position of those who be oppose to i be that they think that the problem will be so overwhelming everybody with good sense will change their position i do not expect to do that
 q. so you definitely expect to do it and secondly
 the president i do not expect to change my position no
 q. what do you think be go to happen in the military there have be all sort of dire prediction of violence of mass comingsout whatever what do you think the impact of this be go to be practically
 the president for one thing i think if you look at the last 10 year of experience here accord to the report we have this country spend $ 500 million in tax dollar to separate something under 16,500 homosexual from the service and have deal with complaint at least of sexual abuse heterosexual abuse largely against woman far great volume but during this period we have plainly have the well educate well train most cohesive military force in the history of the united states and everybody ask anybody and the joint chiefs will tell you that
 they agree that we should stop ask the question this single thing that be divide people on this debate i want to make it very clear that this be a very narrow issue it be whether a person in the absence of any other disqualifying conduct can simply say that he or she be homosexual and stay in the service i do not expect that to spark this kind of problem and i certainly think in the next 6 month as people start to work it through and talk it through a lot of legitimate practical issue will be raise and deal with in a more rational environment that be less charge that be certainly what i hope will happen thank you

thank you very much thank you
 mrs. yandle i never have a well introduction before we thank anyone else i think all of we should acknowledge that it be america 's family who have beat the gridlock in washington to pass family leave people like this fine woman all over america who talk to member of congress both democrat and republican who lay their plight out who ask that their voice be hear when senator gore and i run in the election last year we publish a book call put people first i be very proud that the first bill i be to sign as president truly put people first
 i do want to thank the united states congress for move expeditiously on this matter and for do it before their first recess so that every member of congress who vote for this bill can go home and say we be up there work on your problem and your promise try to make a well future for you this send a clear signal than any word any of we could utter that we have try to give this government back to the american people and i be very appreciative that the congress have move so rapidly on this bill
 there be many many member of congress here and many other who be not here who play a major role in this legislation time do not permit i to mention they all but i do want to thank the senate majority leader for his heroic effort in the 11th hour to make sure we pass this bill senator kennedy and senator dodd for their passionate and year long commitment to this effort i want to thank the speaker speaker foley and congressman ford the chairman of the committee that have jurisdiction over this bill and congresswoman pat schroeder and all the other democrats who work on this bill
 but i want to acknowledge too consistent with the promise i make in my inaugural to reach out to member of both party who would try to push for progress that this bill also have passionate support among republicans my old colleague in the governors association senator kit bond from missouri i thank you for your leadership senator jeffords and senator coats i do not believe be here but they support this bill strongly and congresswoman marge roukema from new jersey her commitment on this be unwavere congresswoman susan molinari from new york and many other republicans vote for speak for and work for this bill i thank they the subcommittee chair who be here and all the other who work so hard to make this bill a real live promise keep for the congress to the people of the united states
 family medical leave have always have the support of a majority of americans from every part of the country from every walk of life from both political party but some people oppose it and they be powerful and it take 8 year and two veto to make this legislation the law of the land now million of our people will no long have to choose between their job and their family
 the law guarantee the right of up to 12 week of unpaid leave per year when it be urgently need at home to care for a newborn child or an ill family member this bill will strengthen our family and i believe it will strengthen our business and our economy as well
 i have spend an enormous amount of time in the last 12 year in the factory and business of this country talk to employer and employee watch the way people work often work with they and i know that man and woman be more productive when they be sure they will not lose their job because they be try to be good parent good child our business should not lose the service of these dedicated americans and over the long run the lesson of the most productive company in the world here at home and around the world be that those who put their people first be those who will triumph in the global economy the business leader who have already institute family and medical leave understand this and i be very proud of some of the business leader who be here today who represent not only themselves but other all across america who be ahead of all of we who make law in do what be right by our family
 family and medical leave be a matter of pure common sense and a matter of common decency it will provide americans what they need most peace of mind never again will parent have to fear lose their job because of their family
 just a week ago i speak to 10 people in family who have experience the kind of problem mrs. yandle have talk about today vice president gore and i talk to people all across america who move we deeply we be sadden to hear their story but today all of we can be happy to think of their future
 now that we have win this difficult battle let i ask all of you to think about what we must do ahead to put the public interest ahead of special interest to pass a budget which will grow this economy and shrink our deficit and to go on about the business of put family first there be a lot more we need to do to help people trap in welfare move to work and independence to strengthen child support enforcement to reward those who work 40 hour a week and have child at home with an increase in the earn income tax credit so we can really say we be reward work instead of dependence to immunize all the child of this country so more parent will not have to take advantage of family leave because their child will be well and strong and healthy
 let all of we who care about our family our people the strength of our economy and the future of our nation put our partisan and other interest aside and be inspire by this great victory today to have other when congress return to this city and we go on about the people 's business
 thank you very much

mr. president mr. speaker members of the house and the senate distinguished americans here as visitor in this chamber as be i. it be nice to have a fresh excuse for give a long speech laughter
 when president speak to congress and the nation from this podium typically they comment on the full range in challenge and opportunity that face the united states but this be not an ordinary time and for all the many task that require our attention i believe tonight one call on we to focus to unite and to act and that be our economy for more than anything else our task tonight as americans be to make our economy thrive again
 let i begin by say that it have be too long at least three decade since a president have come and challenge americans to join he on a great national journey not merely to consume the bounty of today but to invest for a much great one tomorrow
 like individual nation must ultimately decide how they wish to conduct themselves how they wish to be think of by those with whom they live and later how they wish to be judge by history like every individual man and woman nation must decide whether they be prepared to rise to the occasion history present they
 we have always be a people of youthful energy and daring spirit and at this historic moment as communism have fall as freedom be spread around the world as a global economy be take shape before our eye americans have call for change and now it be up to those of we in this room to deliver for they
 our nation need a new direction tonight i present to you a comprehensive plan to set our nation on that new course i believe we will find our new direction in the basic old value that bring we here over the last two century a commitment to opportunity to individual responsibility to community to work to family and to faith we must now break the habit of both political party and say there can be no more something for nothing and admit frankly that we be all in this together
 the condition which bring we as a nation to this point be well know two decade of low productivity growth and stagnant wage persistent unemployment and underemployment year of huge government deficit and decline investment in our future explode health care cost and lack of coverage for million of americans legion of poor child education and job training opportunity inadequate to the demand of this tough global economy for too long we have drift without a strong sense of purpose or responsibility or community
 and our political system so often have seem paralyze by special interest group by partisan bickering and by the sheer complexity of our problem i believe we can do well because we remain the great nation on earth the world 's strong economy the world 's only military superpower if we have the vision the will and the heart to make the change we must we can still enter the 21st century with possibility our parent could not even have imagine and enter it having secure the american dream for ourselves and for future generation
 i well remember 12 year ago president reagan stand at this very podium and tell you and the american people that if our national debt be stack in thousand dollar bill the stack would reach 67 mile into space well today that stack would reach 267 mile i tell you this not to assign blame for this problem there be plenty of blame to go around in both branch of the government and both party the time have come for the blame to end i do not seek this office to place blame i come here tonight to accept responsibility and i want you to accept responsibility with i and if we do right by this country i do not care who get the credit for it
 the plan i offer you have four fundamental component first it shift our emphasis in public and private spending from consumption to investment initially by jumpstart the economy in the short term and invest in our people their job and their income over the long run second it change the rhetoric of the past into the action of the present by honor work and family in every part of our public decision making third it substantially reduce the federal deficit honestly and credibly by use in the beginning the most conservative estimate of government revenue not as the executive branch have do so often in the past use the most optimistic one and finally it seek to earn the trust of the american people by pay for these plan first with cut in government waste and efficiency second with cut not gimmick in government spending and by fairness for a change in the way additional burden be bear
 tonight i want to talk with you about what government can do because i believe government must do more but let i say first that the real engine of economic growth in this country be the private sector and second that each of we must be an engine of growth and change the truth be that as government create more opportunity in this new and different time we must also demand more responsibility in turn
 our immediate priority must be to create job create job now some people say well we be in a recovery and we do not have to do that well we all hope we be in a recovery but we be sure not create new job and there be no recovery worth its salt that do not put the american people back to work
 to create job and guarantee a strong recovery i call on congress to enact an immediate package of job investment of over $ 30 billion to put people to work now to create a half a million job job to rebuild our highway and airport to renovate housing to bring new life to rural community and spread hope and opportunity among our nation 's youth especially i want to emphasize after the event of last year in los angeles and the countless story of despair in our city and in our poor rural community this proposal will create almost 700,000 new summer job for displace unemployed young people alone this summer and tonight i invite america 's business leader to join we in this effort so that together we can provide over one million summer job in city and poor rural area for our young people
 second our plan look beyond today 's business cycle because our aspiration extend into the next century the heart of this plan deal with the long term it be an investment program design to increase public and private investment in area critical to our economic future and it have a deficit reduction program that will increase the saving available for the private sector to invest will lower interest rate will decrease the percentage of the federal budget claim by interest payment and decrease the risk of financial market disruption that could adversely affect our economy
 over the long run all this will bring we a high rate of economic growth improve productivity more high quality job and an improved economic competitive position in the world in order to accomplish both increase investment and deficit reduction something no american government have ever be call upon to do at the same time before spending must be cut and taxis must be raise
 the spending cut i recommend be carefully think through in a way to minimize any adverse economic impact to capture the peace dividend for investment purpose and to switch the balance in the budget from consumption to more investment the tax increase and the spending cut be both design to assure that the cost of this historic program to face and deal with our problem will be bear by those who could readily afford it the most our plan be design furthermore and perhaps in some way most importantly to improve the health of american business through low interest rate more incentive to invest and well train worker
 because small business have create such a high percentage of all the new job in our nation over the last 10 or 15 year our plan include the bold target incentive for small business in history we propose a permanent investment tax credit for the small firm in this country with revenue of under $ 5 million that be about 90 percent of the firm in america employ about 40 percent of the work force but create a big majority of the net new job for more than a decade and we propose new reward for entrepreneur who take new risk we propose to give small business access to all the new technology of our time and we propose to attack this credit crunch which have deny small business the credit they need to flourish and prosper
 with a new network of community development bank and $ 1 billion to make the dream of enterprise zone real we propose to bring new hope and new job to storefront and factory from south boston to south texas to south central los angeles this plan invest in our road our bridge our transit system in high speed railway and high tech information system and it provide the most ambitious environmental cleanup in partnership with state and local government of our time to put people to work and to preserve the environment for our future
 stand as we be on the edge of a new century we know that economic growth depend as never before on open up new market overseas and expand the volume of world trade and so we will insist on fair trade rule in international market as a part of a national economic strategy to expand trade include the successful completion of the late round of world trade talk and the successful completion of a north american free trade agreement with appropriate safeguard for our worker and for the environment
 at the same time and i say this to you in both party and across america tonight all the people who be listen it be not enough to pass a budget or even to have a trade agreement this world be change so fast that we must have aggressive target attempt to create the high wage job of the future that be what all our competitor be do we must give special attention to those critical industry that be go to explode in the 21st century but that be in trouble in america today like aerospace we must provide special assistance to area and to worker displace by cut in the defense budget and by other unavoidable economic dislocation
 and again i will say we must do this together i pledge to you that i will do my good to see that business and labor and government work together for a change
 but all of our effort to strengthen the economy will fail let i say this again i feel so strongly about this all of our effort to strengthen the economy will fail unless we also take this year not next year not 5 year from now but this year bold step to reform our health care system
 in 1992 we spend 14 percent of our income on health care more than 30 percent more than any other country in the world and yet we be the only advanced nation that do not provide a basic package of health care benefit to all of its citizen unless we change the present pattern 50 percent of the growth in the deficit between now and the year 2000 will be in health care cost by the year 2000 almost 20 percent of our income will be in health care our family will never be secure our business will never be strong and our government will never again be fully solvent until we tackle the health care crisis we must do it this year
 the combination of the rise cost of care and the lack of care and the fear of lose care be endanger the security and the very life of million of our people and they be weaken our economy every day reduce health care cost can liberate literally hundred of billion of dollar for new investment in growth and job bring health cost in line with inflation would do more for the private sector in this country than any tax cut we could give and any spending program we could promote reform health care over the long run be critically essential to reduce not only our deficit but to expand investment in america
 later this spring after the first lady and the many good people who be help she all across the country complete their work i will deliver to congress a comprehensive plan for health care reform that finally will bring cost under control and provide security to all of our family so that no one will be deny the coverage they need but so that our economic future will not be compromise either we will have to root out fraud and overcharge and make sure that paperwork no long choke your doctor we will have to maintain the high american standard and the right to choose in a system that be the world 's fine for all those who can access it but first we must make choice we must choose to give the american people the quality they demand and deserve with a system that will not bankrupt the country or far drive more americans into agony
 let i far say that i want to work with all of you on this i realize this be a complicated issue but we must address it and i believe if there be any chance that republicans and democrats who disagree on taxis and spending or anything else could agree on one thing surely we can all look at these number and go home and tell our people the truth we can not continue these spending pattern in public or private dollar for health care for less and less and less every year we can do well and i will work to do well
 perhaps the most fundamental change the new direction i propose offer be its focus on the future and its investment which i seek in our child each day we delay really make a commitment to our child carry a dear cost half of the 2 year old in this country today do not receive the immunization they need against deadly disease our plan will provide they for every eligible child and we know now that we will save $ 10 later for every $ 1 we spend by eliminate preventable childhood disease that be a good investment no matter how you measure it
 i recommend that the woman infant and child 's nutrition program be expand so that every expectant mother who need the help get it we all know that head start a program that prepare child for school be a success story we all know that it save money but today it just reach barely over one third of all the eligible child under this plan every eligible child will be able to get a head start this be not just the right thing to do it be the smart thing to do for every dollar we invest today we will save $ 3 tomorrow we have to start think about tomorrow i have hear that somewhere before laughter
 we have to ask more in our school of our student our teacher our principal our parent yes we must give they the resource they need to meet high standard but we must also use the authority and the influence and the funding of the education department to promote strategy that really work in learn money alone be not enough we have to do what really work to increase learn in our school
 we have to recognize that all of our high school graduate need some further education in order to be competitive in this global economy so we have to establish a partnership between business and education and the government for apprenticeship program in every state in this country to give our people the skill they need lifelong learning must benefit not just young high school graduate but worker too throughout their career the average 18 year old today will change job seven time in a lifetime we have do a lot in this country on worker training in the last few year but the system be too fractured we must develop a unify simplified sensible streamlined worker training program so that worker receive the training they need regardless of why they lose their job or whether they simply need to learn something new to keep they we have get to do well on this
 and finally i propose a program that get a great response from the american people all across this country last year a program of national service to make college loan available to all americans and to challenge they at the same time to give something back to their country as teacher or police officer or community service worker to give they the option to pay the loan back but at tax time so they can not beat the bill but to encourage they instead to pay it back by make their country strong and make their country well and give we the benefit of their knowledge
 a generation ago when president kennedy propose and the united states congress embrace the peace corps it define the character of a whole generation of americans commit to serve people around the world in this national service program we will provide more than twice as many slot for people before they go to college to be in national service than ever serve in the peace corps this program could do for this generation of member of congress what the land grant college act do and what the gi bill do for former congressman in the future historian who get their education through the national service loan will look back on you and thank you for give america a new lease on life if you meet this challenge
 if we believe in job and we believe in learn we must believe in reward work if we believe in restore the value that make america special we must believe that there be dignity in all work and there must be dignity for all worker to those who care for our sick who tend our child who do our most difficult and tiring job the new direction i propose will make this solemn simple commitment by expand the refundable earn income tax credit we will make history we will reward the work of million of work poor americans by realize the principle that if you work 40 hour a week and you have get a child in the house you will no long be in poverty
 later this year we will offer a plan to end welfare as we know it i have work on this issue for the well part of a decade and i know from personal conversation with many people that no one no one want to change the welfare system as badly as those who be trap in it i want to offer the people on welfare the education the training the child care the health care they need to get back on their foot but say after 2 year they must get back to work too in private business if possible in public service if necessary we have to end welfare as a way of life and make it a path to independence and dignity
 our next great goal should be to strengthen our family i compliment the congress for pass the family and medical leave act as a good first step but it be time to do more this plan will give this country the tough child support enforcement system it have ever have it be time to demand that people take responsibility for the child they bring in this world
 and i ask you to help to protect our family against the violent crime which terrorize our people and which tear our community apart we must pass a tough crime bill i support not only the bill which do not quite make it to the president 's desk last year but also an initiative to put 100,000 more police officer on the street to provide boot camp for first time nonviolent offender for more space for the harden criminal in jail and i support an initiative to do what we can to keep gun out of the hand of criminal let i say this i will make you this bargain if you will pass the brady bill i will sure sign it
 let i say now we should move to the hard part
 i think it be clear to every american include every member of congress of both party that the confidence of the people who pay our bill in our institution in washington be not high we must restore it we must begin again to make government work for ordinary taxpayer not simply for organized interest group and that beginning must start with real political reform i be ask the united states congress to pass a real campaign finance reform bill this year i ask you to increase the participation of the american people by pass the motor voter bill promptly i ask you to deal with the undue influence of special interest by pass a bill to end the tax deduction for lobbying and to act quickly to require all the people who lobby you to register as lobbyist by pass the lobby registration bill
 believe i they be cheer that last section at home i believe lobby reform and campaign finance reform be a sure path to increase popularity for republicans and democrats alike because it say to the voter back home this be your house this be your senate we be your hire hand and every penny we draw be your money
 next to revolutionize government we have to ensure that we live within our mean and that should start at the top and with the white house in the last few day i have announce a cut in the white house staff of 25 percent save approximately $ 10 million i have order administrative cut in budget of agency and department i have cut the federal bureaucracy or will over the next 4 year by approximately 100,000 position for a combine saving of $ 9 billion it be time for government to demonstrate in the condition we be in that we can be as frugal as any household in america
 and that be why i also want to congratulate the congress i notice the announcement of the leadership today that congress be take similar step to cut its cost i think that be important i think it will send a very clear signal to the american people
 but if we really want to cut spending we be go to have to do more and some of it will be difficult tonight i call for an across the board freeze in federal government salary for one year and thereafter during this 4 year period i recommend that salary rise at one point low than the cost of live allowance normally involve in federal pay increase
 next i recommend that we make 150 specific budget cut as you know and that all those who say we should cut more be as specific as i have be
 finally let i say to my friend on both side of the aisle it be not enough simply to cut government we have to rethink the whole way it work when i become president i be amazed at just the way the white house work in way that add lot of money to what taxpayer have to pay outmoded way that do not take maximum advantage of technology and do not do thing that any business would have do year ago to save taxpayer money
 so i want to bring a new spirit of innovation into every government department i want to push education reform as i say not just to spend more money but to really improve learn some thing work and some thing do not we ought to be subsidize the thing that work and discourage the thing that do not i would like to use that superfund to clean up pollution for a change and not just pay lawyer
 in the aftermath of all the difficulty with the saving and loan we must use federal bank regulator to protect the security and safety of our financial institution but they should not be use to continue the credit crunch and to stop people from make sensible loan
 i would like for we to not only have welfare reform but to reexamine the whole focus of all of our program that help people to shift they from entitlement program to empowerment program in the end we want people not to need we anymore i think that be important
 but in the end we have to get back to the deficit for year there be be a lot of talk about it but very few credible effort to deal with it and now i understand why having deal with the real number for 4 week but i believe this plan do it tackle the budget deficit seriously and over the long term it put in place one of the big deficit reduction and one of the big change in federal priority from consumption to investment in the history of this country at the same time over the next 4 year
 let i say to all the people watch we tonight who will ask i these question begin tomorrow as i go around the country and who have ask it in the past we be not cut the deficit just because expert say it be the thing to do or because it have some intrinsic merit we have to cut the deficit because the more we spend pay off the debt the less tax dollar we have to invest in job and education and the future of this country and the more money we take out of the pool of available saving the hard it be for people in the private sector to borrow money at affordable interest rate for a college loan for their child for a home mortgage or to start a new business
 that be why we have get to reduce the debt because it be crowd out other activity that we ought to be engage in and that the american people ought to be engage in we cut the deficit so that our child will be able to buy a home so that our company can invest in the future and in retrain their worker so that our government can make the kind of investment we need to be a strong and smart and safe nation
 if we do not act now you and i might not even recognize this government 10 year from now if we just stay with the same trend of the last 4 year by the end of the decade the deficit will be $ 635 billion a year almost 80 percent of our gross domestic product and pay interest on that debt will be the costly government program of all we will still be the world 's large debtor and when members of congress come here they will be devote over 20 cent on the dollar to interest payment more than half of the budget to health care and to other entitlement and you will come here and deliberate and argue over 6 or 7 cent on the dollar no matter what america 's problem be we will not be able to have the independence we need to chart the future that we must and we will be terribly dependent on foreign fund for a large portion of our investment
 this budget plan by contrast will by 1997 cut $ 140 billion in that year alone from the deficit a real spending cut a real revenue increase a real deficit reduction use the independent number of the congressional budget office laughter well you can laugh my fellow republicans but i will point out that the congressional budget office be normally more conservative in what be go to happen and close to right than previous president have be
 i do this so that we could argue about priority with the same set of number i do this so that no one could say i be estimate my way out of this difficulty i do this because if we can agree together on the most prudent revenue we be likely to get if the recovery stay and we do right thing economically then it will turn out well for the american people than we say in the last 12 year because there be difference over the revenue estimate you and i know that both party be give great elbow room for irresponsibility this be tighten the rein on the democrats as well as the republicans let us at least argue about the same set of number so the american people will think we be shoot straight with they
 as i say early my recommendation make more than 150 difficult reduction to cut the federal spending by a total of $ 246 billion we be eliminate program that be no long need such as nuclear power research and development we be slash subsidy and cancel wasteful project but many of these program be justify in their time and a lot of they be difficult for i to recommend reduction in some really tough one for i personally i recommend that we reduce interest subsidy to the rural electric administration that be a difficult thing for i to recommend but i think that i can not exempt the thing that exist in my state or in my experience if i ask you to deal with thing that be difficult for you to deal with we be go to have to have no sacred cow except the fundamental abide interest of the american people
 i have to say that we all know our government have be just great at building program the time have come to show the american people that we can limit they too that we can not only start thing that we can actually stop thing
 about the defense budget i raise a hope and a caution as we restructure our military force to meet the new threat of the post cold war world it be true that we can responsibly reduce our defense budget and we may all doubt what that range of reduction be but let i say that as long as i be president i will do everything i can to make sure that the man and woman who serve under the american flag will remain the well train the good prepare the well equipped fighting force in the world and every one of you should make that solemn pledge we still have responsibility around the world we be the world 's only superpower this be still a dangerous and uncertain time and we owe it to the people in uniform to make sure that we adequately provide for the national defense and for their interest and need back by an effective national defense and a strong economy our nation will be prepare to lead a world challenge as it be everywhere by ethnic conflict by the proliferation of weapon of mass destruction by the global democratic revolution and by challenge to the health of our global environment
 i know this economic plan be ambitious but i honestly believe it be necessary for the continue greatness of the united states and i think it be pay for fairly first by cut government then by ask the most of those who benefit the most in the past and by ask more americans to contribute today so that all of we can prosper tomorrow
 for the wealthy those earn more than $ 180,000 per year i ask you all who be listen tonight to support a raise in the top rate for federal income taxis from 31 to 36 percent we recommend a 10 percent surtax on income over $ 250,000 a year and we recommend close some loophole that let some people get away without pay any tax at all
 for business with taxable income in excess of $ 10 million we recommend a raise in the corporate tax rate also to 36 percent as well as a cut in the deduction for business entertainment expense our plan seek to attack tax subsidy that actually reward company more for shut their operation down here and move they overseas than for stay here and reinveste in america i say that as someone who believe that american company should be free to invest around the world and as a former governor who actively seek investment of foreign company in my state but the tax code should not express a preference to american company for move somewhere else and it do in particular case today
 we will seek to ensure that through effective tax enforcement foreign corporation who do make money in america simply pay the same taxis that american company make on the same income
 to middle class americans who have pay a great deal for the last 12 year and from whom i ask a contribution tonight i will say again as i do on monday night you be not go alone any more you be certainly not go first and you be not go to pay more for less as you have too often in the past i want to emphasize the fact about this plan 98.8 percent of america 's family will have no increase in their income tax rate only 1.2 percent at the top
 let i be clear there will also be no new cut in benefit for medicare as we move toward the 4th year with the explosion in health care cost as i say project to account for 50 percent of the growth of the deficit between now and the year 2000 there must be plan cut in payment to provider to doctor to hospital to lab as a way of control health care cost but i see these only as a stopgap until we can reform the entire health care system if you will help i do that we can be fair to the provider and to the consumer of health care let i repeat this because i know it matter to a lot of you on both side of the aisle this plan do not make a recommendation for new cut in medicare benefit for any beneficiary
 secondly the only change we be make in social security be one that have already be publicize the plan do ask old americans with high income who do not rely solely on social security to get by to contribute more this plan will not affect the 80 percent of social security recipient who do not pay taxis on social security now those who do not pay tax on social security now will not be affect by this plan
 our plan do include a broad base tax on energy and i want to tell you why i select this and why i think it be a good idea i recommend that we adopt a btu tax on the heat content of energy as the good way to provide we with revenue to lower the deficit because it also combat pollution promote energy efficiency promote the independence economically of this country as well as help to reduce the debt and because it do not discriminate against any area unlike a carbon tax that be not too hard on the coal states unlike a gas tax that be not too tough on people who drive a long way to work unlike an ad valorem tax it do not increase just when the price of an energy source go up and it be environmentally responsible it will help we in the future as well as in the present with the deficit
 take together these measure will cost an american family with an income of about $ 40,000 a year less than $ 17 a month it will cost american family with income under $ 30,000 nothing because of other program we propose principally those raise the earn income tax credit
 because of our publicly state determination to reduce the deficit if we do these thing we will see the continuation of what be happen just since the election just since the election since the secretary of the treasury the director of the office of management and budget and other who have begin to speak out publicly in favor of a tough deficit reduction plan interest rate have continue to fall long term that mean that for the middle class who will pay something more each month if they have any credit need or demand their increase energy cost will be more than offset by low interest cost for mortgage consumer loan credit card this can be a wise investment for they and their country now
 i would also point out what the american people already know and that be because we be a big vast country where we drive long distance we have maintain far low burden on energy than any other advanced country we will still have far low burden on energy than any other advanced country and these will be spread fairly with real attempt to make sure that no cost be impose on family with income under $ 30,000 and that the cost be very modest until you get into the high income group where the income taxis trigger in
 now i ask all of you to consider this whatever you think of the tax program whatever you think of the spending cut consider the cost of not change remember the number that you all know if we just keep on do what we be do by the end of the decade we will have a $ 650 billion a year deficit if we just keep on do what we be do by the end of the decade 20 percent of our national income will go to health care every year twice as much as any other country on the face of the globe if we just keep on do what we be do over 20 cent on the dollar will have to go to service the debt
 unless we have the courage now to start build our future and stop borrow from it we be condemn ourselves to year of stagnation interrupt by occasional recession to slow growth in job to no more growth in income to more debt to more disappointment bad unless we change unless we increase investment and reduce the debt to raise productivity so that we can generate both job and income we will be condemn our child and our child 's child to a less life than we enjoy once americans look forward to double their living standard every 25 year at present productivity rate it will take 100 year to double living standard until our grandchild 's grandchild be bear i say that be too long to wait
 tonight the american people know we have to change but they be also likely to ask i tomorrow and all of you for the week and month ahead whether we have the fortitude to make the change happen in the right way they know that as soon as i leave this chamber and you go home various interest group will be out in force lobby against this or that piece of this plan and that the force of conventional wisdom will offer a thousand reason why we well ought to do this but we just can not do it
 our people will be watch and wonder not to see whether you disagree with i on a particular issue but just to see whether this be go to be business as usual or a real new day whether we be all go to conduct ourselves as if we know we be work for they we must scale the wall of the people 's scepticism not with our word but with our deed after so many year of gridlock and indecision after so many hopeful beginning and so few promising result the american people be go to be harsh in their judgment of all of we if we fail to seize this moment
 this economic plan can not please everybody if the package be pick apart there will be something that will anger each of we will not please anybody but if it be take as a whole it will help all of we so i ask you all to begin by resist the temptation to focus only on a particular spending cut you do not like or some particular investment that be not make and nobody like the tax increase but let us just face fact for 20 year through administration of both party income have stall and debt have explode and productivity have not grow as it should we can not deny the reality of our condition we have get to play the hand we be deal and play it as well we can
 my fellow americans the test of this plan can not be what be in it for i it have get to be what be in it for we if we work hard and if we work together if we rededicate ourselves to create job to reward work to strengthen our family to reinvent our government we can lift our country 's fortune again
 tonight i ask everyone in this chamber and every american to look simply into your heart to spark your own hope to fire your own imagination there be so much good so much possibility so much excitement in this country now that if we act boldly and honestly as leader should our legacy will be one of prosperity and progress this must be america 's new direction let we summon the courage to seize it

 i be glad to be here you know when i come down here i always sort of relax i do not know why that be i time it just in time for the jazz festival but i leave my saxophone at the white house

 this be the 100th day of my administration in washington some say it mark a milestone but in many way it be just another day at the office for what we be try to do in change america in the last 99 day we have work relentlessly to address the pressing and long ignore need of the american people and to bring to the government something it have not see in a long time an acknowledgment that bold action be need and need now to secure and enlarge america 's future and that in order to do it we not only have to change program we have to change the way the government work and engage the energy of the american people in the process

 in the last 100 day i think we have begin to change the direction in which our country have be go for a long time and to go toward a new direction more like the one the american people demand last november we have also start an unprecedented debate in our nation 's capital about big idea and well life across our nation idea that in many case be shape and nurture by some of the people who be here today as senator breaux say early the member of the democratic leadership council of which i be proud to be a found member unlike most organization the dlc have do more than just talk about the problem in our country it have make an honest effort to develop real idea about how to restore the american economy and make the government work and rebuild the confidence and the link that exist between the american people and their government when thing be at their good here and it be be a laboratory for experimentation and solution

 during my year with the dlc we really try to refine our philosophy of what it would mean to take not only the democratic party but the united states of america in a new direction to make our country work again and to reward work and family to encourage education and enterprise to establish what i have often call a new covenant with the american people create opportunity but demand responsibility from all so that once again we could be a true american community where we know and believe and live as if we be all in this together this group have conceive many of the idea that i have advocate since i have be in washington from set a limit on welfare and put people to work to police reform and community police to rewarding work of low income work people by have an earn income tax credit that would lift the work poor with child out of poverty so we could say if you work 40 hour a week in this country you have a child in the house you ought not to be poor these be the kind of thing that this organization have do they help to develop the idea i want to talk to you today about that have so much to do with the future of the young people here and throughout our country national service this be an organization about idea

 now in washington as you might imagine we do not always agree with one another and that be good that be why we have get a system where the government 's divide up and we have two party and we have people fight all the time as long as it be about idea but too often we have see that the debate over big idea get mire in petty politic i know one thing the american people be tired of gridlock and petty politic if we be go to fight they want we to fight over idea and the future of this country

 in the past 99 day we try to address the problem the american people tell i they want to be address we focus more than anything else on the economy pass the outline of a budget that will reduce the deficit by more than $ 500 billion increase investment in education and technology and the thing that will create the economy of the 21st century that all of you need so that you will have good and decent job and a decent future lay the groundwork for a more prosperous tomorrow

 just in 100 day we have announce a policy to help to convert the defense cutback and the economic opportunity for people who be lose their job because of the military cutback to take a new direction in technology to create more opportunity for our people to be more aggressive in preserve the environment but do it in a way that create job not a way that cost job to have a trade policy that will really reflect our common interest with other nation and expand job and opportunity everywhere we have begin the long overdue renovation of the american economic base the question now unlike 100 day ago the question be now not whether we be go to reduce the deficit but how and how much the question now be not whether the government will have a new partnership with the private sector to shape the economy but exactly what the detail will be and how much our part will be

 we have also take on the issue of health care something million of americans cry out for last year i get a letter today from a young woman i shake hand with whose literally her life be on the line and she can not get health insurance it be wrong that in this nation we be the only advanced country in the world with 34 million people without health insurance it be wrong that million of americans can not change their job without lose their health insurance because they or a child or a spouse have be sick it be wrong that the price of health care go up 2.5 time the rate of inflation every year and it be wrong that we spend 30 percent more of our income than any other country on earth on health care and have less to show for it but it be also wrong to assume that there be some magic quick answer that be why we have be work with a task force head by the first lady and over 400 people from all aspect of health care to do something about this

 but now for the american people the issue be no long whether we be go to address the health care crisis whether we be go to provide security to hard work middle class americans whether we be go to cover the people who be not cover whether we be go to control cost but how be we go to do it and how fast and when be we go to begin i hope the answer be soon and not too soon be soon enough for i

 there be a lot of discussion last year about how bad the government be and it do not work and it be bloat it need a change look at the last 100 day i have try to set an example by offer a budget to reduce the white house staff by 25 percent by put the lid on and reduce the federal bureaucratic expense the administrative expense of the federal government by over $ 10 billion by move dramatically to reduce the influence of special interest on executive branch appointment by have the tough ethic law and restriction on people become lobbyist for other interest when they leave the payroll of the president of the united states by ask the vice president to share the most sweeping review of the way the federal government work in a generation with a promise of real reform and reinvent government something else this organization have long believe in

 we be move and the congress be move to join the congress have vote to cut the administrative cost of run the congress something many of you never think you would see happen they do that the house of representatives vote yesterday to give the president of the united states a modify line item veto and i hope the senate will follow their lead i hope soon they will send to my desk the motor voter bill which will make it easy for young people and other people to vote and participate in their country 's political process and there will be campaign finance reform and lobby reform legislation and a crime bill that will put more police on the street and give we the capacity we need to take our community back these thing be go on the question be no long whether we be go to reform the way government work but how fast and how much and how well and those be the right question my fellow americans good question to ask

 and now i come to the last and in many way the most important issue that we have try to address the economy yes health care yes reform in the way the government work yes but also what about the american people how can each american make a contribution how can each american do the work that all americans must take responsibility for himself or herself and grow up into a vibrant community we have try to address those issue as well the buzz word now people use be empowerment i use to call it responsibility i often have say and i want to reiterate today the united states government can not create an opportunity for anyone who will not be responsible enough to seize it opportunity be a two way street and require responsibility that be the only way we will ever rebuild the american community

 in the day and month ahead you will see the secretary of education talk about his remarkable education program to provide tough national standard in education but also to give people at the grass root level more flexibility in make public education work you will see the secretary of agriculture and the secretary of housing and urban development talk about how we can empower even the poor americans to start their own business save their own money and take control of their own future you will see other people talk about how we can reform the welfare system all of these thing be at the core of the notion that we ought to make it possible for every american to live up to the full of his or her godgiven ability and that be what in the end national service be all about help ourselves and help each other at the same time

 on this 100th day of my administration i want to recommit myself and those who work with i to the value that have make our nation without peer in all human history those of opportunity responsibility community and respect for one another today i want to propose apply those value to a revolution of opportunity for our hard press family and for those who have be leave out as a first step we be go to ease the term of college loan help student from middle and low middle income family to clear a major path to the american dream the path of high education in return we will demand responsibility from young people we will make it easy to borrow money and much easy to pay it off but this time you have to pay it off you can not just default on the loan and we will also offer the young people of america the opportunity of pay their loan back by serve their community in a new program of national service

 in just a few day i will send to the congress two bill contain our proposal first to strengthen college opportunity and to establish national service together they will revive america 's commitment to community and make affordable the cost of a college education for every american it be no secret that over the last 10 or 12 year the cost of a college education be about the only essential think that be go up even more rapidly than health care cost and middle class parent and even upper middle class parent not to mention low income people have bear the burden pay now about five percent of median income just to put one child through a 4 year in state public college it cost an average of over $ 5,200 a year for that education that mean family be deplete saving and many student be face with cut back to a part time course load or have to drop out simply because of the cost of a college education a college dropout be now more than twice the high school dropout rate we can not afford that and we can do well

 i propose a new way to finance college for million of student who seek loan every year we call it an excel account with it student can repay the loan they take out not with a percentage of the loan they borrow but with a percentage of their actual earning now think about that for student drive by debt into career with high pay and low satisfaction this can be very liberating take a student tear for example between pursue a career in teaching and corporate law this student now can at least make the career choice base on what he or she want to do and not the size of the outstanding student loan because we propose to let everybody have the option of pay the student loan back base on how much they earn not just how much they owe that be an incredible incentive

 however under the current system as many of you know student face with big bill or just inconvenient responsibility have too often take the irresponsible route and default on their loan or have be find in default because they could not find a job often time there be no serious effort to collect the loan because the government guarantee 90 percent of it so if the bank make the loan it cost more than 10 percent to go collect it what be the result the taxpayer every year pay about $ 3 billion on other people 's loan money that could be spend on your education on the school here on the future of the child here just for bad loan it be not right

 under our system the department of education would engage the internal revenue service we would have the payroll record and you would not be able to beat the bill because you would have to pay the loan back as a percentage of your income if you choose but you would have to pay it because you pay taxis and because we have your record and because you will not be able to get out of it and that be the right thing to do

 but these excel account be just the beginning we hope they will lead more and more americans not only to seize the opportunity of a college education and to exert a strong sense of responsibility but also to seek to serve their community through a program of national service it be thomas jefferson who first tell the american people in essence that the more you know the more you owe in his word and i quote a debt of service be due from every man to his country proportion to the bounty which nature and fortune have measure to he this statement remind we that value never go out of fashion that civic responsibility be as good for democracy today as it be when thomas jefferson say that and that if you really want to be the good citizen of your country you have to give something back to your country with national service we can literally open a new world to a new generation of americans where high learning go hand in hand with the high purpose of address our unmet need our educational our social our environmental need to secure the future that we all will share national service will mark the start of a new era for america in which every citizen every one of you can become an agent of change arm with the knowledge and experience that a college education bring and ready to transform the world in which we live city by city community by community block by block i say to you we need you

 you know there be a lot of talk in america today and i spend hour every week worry about the effect that automation and technology be have on employment indeed as we see the productivity of american enterprise rise their need for worker go down because they can do more with compute that they use to do with people so people ask i all the time where will we find the job for this new generation of americans how can we drive this unemployment rate down but if you look around this country at all the human problem all the homeless people all the environmental waste dump in our city and our rural area all the problem that we have get in every community in america and see all the kid that be in trouble—15 million of they at risk and need somebody to pay attention to you know where the work need to be

 late last night when i be prepare to come down here i take a little time off at my desk and i read the letter that my staff have give i and i get a letter from a woman who grow up with i i have know here since we be in grade school in this letter she say you know someone ask i a couple of day ago how be we go to save all these kid in this country that be in trouble and she say without even think i blurt out the same way we lose they one at a time and so today my fellow americans i issue a call to national service to americans young and old democrats and republicans white black hispanic asian and you name it all of we that make up this great nation i call you to national service because it be only that together we can advance a tradition root in our people 's history help our people to help themselves and with national service we can rejoin the citizen in community of this country bond each to the other with the glue of common purpose and real patriotism

 we have many young people here today student of this place of high learning where we be gather in you i know i see the builder of tomorrow and i say to you as good as the education be here and at the other great institution represent here today and all across america the power of academic learning be incomplete unless every american can share in it that be the only way we can lift our whole country up i say to you far that our country need you we need your knowledge and your initiative and your energy we need you because you be still strip and free of the cynicism that have paralyze too many of your parent and your grandparent and lead we to spend too much time talk about what we can not do instead of seize what we can you be not afflict by that and i pray you never will be

 we need to make sure that we can use your energy and your talent one way be by make sure that the low wage that public service often offer will not be a route to the poorhouse for someone with college loan as i say we be go to make it easy for you to pay off your college loan but also if you engage in national service we will make it easy for you to pay off a college debt or to earn credit toward it before you go to college or while you be in college

 for each term of service 1 or 2 year participant in national service program will receive benefit that can be use toward past present or future obligation whether for college or advanced job training you can get a college education and in addition through service perhaps the good experience of your life that be a pretty good investment

 i have talk a lot about the student here and they do play a large part in this plan but they be not alone here in new orleans many of you already know what it mean to make a difference in your community because you have just be do that for a long time and i be very proud as i say i be go to get another cheer about this but one of the model that i have a little something to do with be the delta service corps and i appreciate what they be do applause

 there be people here work to restore housing there be people here work in other way i just want to mention three lawrence williams a team leader in the corps who have help to restore housing for low income people with the local habitat for humanity project jane sullivan a retire public schoolteacher and a former vista volunteer who help rural community gain well access to health care housing and other assistance and a young person i meet just a few moment ago parris moore brown who work with parent in housing program for drug awareness outreach and now plan to work with the physically challenge she say that she have no tolerance for self pity and she live what she preach she have not be slow by what her birth deal she a brittle bone disorder that have leave she as an adult and by her own measure 4 foot 2 1/4 inch tall where be you stand up on here so we can see you after my meeting with she and the other young people today i would say she stand about 10 foot tall in america today there be ten of thousand of people like parris and jane and lawrence and those of you who be here with these service program who be die to be call to a new season of service and we want to do that

 another part of our plan be to build on the national and community service act that be pass in 1990 and the already flourish program that be start and up and go in every state in this country national service be not go to be a federal bureaucracy it be go to operate at the grass root with the real problem of real people and with the program that work today it will be locally drive because i trust the community in this country to make decision for themselves

 i also want to say that while we want very much to have young people in this program who be work toward earn credit for college or pay their college loan off through national service we need so many other people in service project we need our old people who never will go back to college but have a lifetime of experience and energy to give to the young people of this country we need young people who may not be old enough to drive a car or to qualify for this program but can have a dramatic impact on fellow student by help they learn well study habit or just keep they out of trouble i have learn already that as the parent of a teenager that the peer can have a big impact on the shape and quality of a child 's life even a child can serve in program that now begin as early as kindergarten we have no upper age limit in america or low age limit for be a good public servant

 to be successful this national program will need the broad base support of all the american people parent and child church and synagogue college and university and the potential provider and the beneficiary of our service in this vision of national service everyone be a partner and that include of course the business community in this country we need business to contribute to the effort to match federal money and local program and to contribute at the national level help to make sure that the program we choose be good one indeed

 what will set this legislation apart from other similar effort in the past that reward service to our country be that it will totally eliminate the federal government bureaucracy and believe i no one will miss that we be go to set up a national service corporation that will run like a big venture capital outfit not like a bureaucracy and community as i say will have the flexibility to make their own program work i think that i have see enough today and i have hear enough of your applause to know that the american people be hungry for a chance to serve their country and to reap the reward of civic pride and education in the process

 in answer this call our people be follow a proud history more than a century ago president abraham lincoln sign the homestead act and the frontier of this country be settle by countless family who take up the challenge in exchange for 100 acre to call their own in the 1930 's president roosevelt enlist million of young people to restore the environment through the civilian conservation corps fdr give other a chance to support themselves through the building make possible by the works project administration i be in the united states justice department just yesterday a building build in 1934 by people who be give service to their country and it be still a beautiful monument to the legacy of that kind of service the parent of the baby boom have the gi bill which be one of the good investment our government ever make a generation ago the young people of my generation see suffering in latin america asia and africa and many rush to the challenge lay down by president kennedy when he create the peace corps which become our country 's great ambassador build bridge of understanding to far off culture and now three decade later a challenge have be present to all of you a new challenge and an old one as old as america and as new as your future

 a year ago when the democratic leadership council meet in new orleans i ask the following question i say i want you to think about what kind of citizen you be go to be—[inaudible]—administration that this be the day the american people be empower to renew their nation and their community to seize a well future for themselves and to help all of we to be what the—[inaudible]—out of help our fellow citizen and ourselves to become what we ought to be this country will be all right

 thank you very much and god bless you all

to all of our distinguished guest from all the service to general powell and the joint chiefs secretary aspin mr. vice president lady and gentleman and especially to general johnston and the man and woman of the unified task force in somalia

 although your mission be humanitarian and not combat you nonetheless face difficult and dangerous condition you sometimes be subject to abuse and force to dodge rock and even bullet you see firsthand the horror of hunger disease and death but you press on with what you set out to do and you be successful you have serve in the good tradition of the armed forces of the united states and you have make the american people very very proud
 in the week to come we will formally recognize the contribution of those who participate in operation restore hope but early today to honor their accomplishment and that of all who support that effort i award to general johnston the defense distinguished service medal in recognition not only of his extraordinary service but also of all those who serve with he so well thank you all for your dedicated work
 to understand the magnitude of what our force in somalia accomplish the world need only look back at somalia 's condition just 6 month ago hundred of thousand of people be starve armed anarchy rule the land and the street of every city and town today food be flow crop be grow school and hospital be reopen although there be still much to be do if endure peace be to prevail one can now envision a day when somalia will be reconstruct as a function civil society
 if all of you who serve have not go it be absolutely certain that ten of thousand would have die by now you save their life you give the people of somalia the opportunity to look beyond starvation and focus on their future and the future of their child although you go on a mission of peace eight americans do not return we salute each of they we thank they and their family america will never forget what they do or what they give to their love one we extend our heart and our prayer
 as we honor the service of those who have return and those who do not it be fitting that we reflect on what the successful mission signifie for the future this the large humanitarian relief operation in history have write an important new chapter in the international annal of peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance
 you have show that the work of the just can prevail over the arm of the warlord you have demonstrate that the world be ready to mobilize its resource in new way to face the challenge of a new age and you have prove yet again that american leadership can help to mobilize international action to create a well world
 you also leave behind a u.n. peacekeeping force with a significant american component this force be a reflection of the new era we have enter for it have americans participate in new way just hour ago general johnston turn over command to general bir of turkey as untaf become unosom ii you set the stage and make it possible for that force to do its mission and for the somalis to complete the work of rebuild and create a peaceful self sustain and democratic civil society
 your successful return remind we that other mission lie ahead for our nation some we can foresee and other we can not as always we stand ready to defend our interest work with other where possible and by ourselves where necessary but increasingly in this new era we will need to work with an array of multinational partner often in new arrangement you have prove again that that be possible you have prove again that our involvement in multilateral effort need not be open ended or illdefine that we can go abroad and accomplish some distinct objective and then come home again when the mission be accomplish
 some will ask why if the cold war end we must still support the world 's great military force the kind that general johnston and his comrade represent i say it be because we still have interest we still face threat we still have responsibility the word have not see the end of evil and america can lead other country to share more of the responsibility that they ought to be shoulder
 some will ask why we must so often be the one to lead well of course we can not be the world 's policeman but we be and we must continue to be the world 's leader that be the job of the united states of america and so today america open its arm in a hearty welcome home
 general to you and all the man and woman who serve with you you have the admiration of the world and the thank of your country for continue the tradition of our armed forces and the value that make we proud to be americans and for prove that we can lead and serve in new way in a new world
 in the word of the scripture blessed be the peacemaker thank you very much

father creedon mrs. kennedy the child of robert kennedy and the kennedy family to all the distinguished americans here present and most of all to all of you who bear the noble title citizen of this country
 twenty five year ago today on the eve of my college graduation i cheer the victory of robert kennedy in the california primary and feel again that our country might face its problem openly meet its challenge bravely and go forward together he dare we all he dare the grieving not to retreat into despair he dare the comfortable not to be complacent he dare the doubting to keep go
 as i look around this crowd today and see we all grace not only by the laughter of child but by the tear of those of we old enough to remember it strike i again that the memory of robert kennedy be so powerful that in a profound way we be all in two place today we be here and now and we be there then
 for in robert kennedy we all invest our hope and our dream that somehow we might redeem the promise of the america we then fear we be lose somehow we might call back the promise of president kennedy and martin luther king and heal the division of vietnam and the violence and pain in our own country but i believe if robert kennedy be here today he would dare we not to mourn his passing but to fulfill his promise and to be the people that he so badly want we all to be he would dare we to leave yesterday and embrace tomorrow
 we remember he almost capture in freeze frame stand on the hood of a car grasp at outreache hand black and brown and white his promise be that the hand which reach out to he might someday actually reach out to each other and together those hand could make america everything that it ought to be a nation reunite with itself and rededicate to its good ideal
 when his funeral train pass through the gritty city of the northeast people from both side of the track stand silent he have earn their respect because he go to place most leader never visit and listen to people most leader never hear and speak simple truth most leader never speak
 he speak out against neglect but he challenge the neglect to seize their own destiny he want so badly for government to act but he do not trust bureaucracy and he believe that government have to do thing with people not for they he know we have to do thing together or not at all he speak to the son and daughter of immigrant and the son and daughter of sharecropper and tell they all as long as you stay apart from each other you will never be what you ought to be
 he see the word not in term of right and leave but right and wrong and he teach we lesson that can not be label except as powerful proof robert kennedy remind we that on any day in any place at any time racism be wrong exploitation be wrong violence be wrong anything that deny the simple humanity and potential of any man or woman be wrong
 he touch child whose stomach be swollen with hunger but whose eye still sparkle with life he march with worker who strain their back for poverty wage while harvest our food he walk down city street with people who ache not from work but from the lack of it then as now his pierce eye and urgent voice speak of the thing we all like to think that we believe in
 when he be alive some say he be ruthless some say he be not a real liberal and other claim he be a real radical if he be here today i think he would laugh and say they be both right but now as we see he more clearly we understand he be a man who be very gentle to those who be most vulnerable very tough in the standard he keep for himself very old fashioned in the virtue in which he believe and a relentless searcher for change for growth for the potential of heart and mind that he seek in himself and he demand of other
 robert kennedy understand that the real purpose of leadership be to bring out the good in other he believe the destiny of our nation be the sum total of all the decision that all of we make he often say that one person can make a difference and each of we must try
 some still believe we lose what be good about america when president kennedy and martin luther king and robert kennedy be kill but i ask you to remember my fellow americans that robert kennedy do not lose his faith when his own brother be kill and when martin luther king be kill he give from his heart what be perhaps his fine speech he lift himself from despair time after time and go back to work
 if you listen now you can hear with i his voice tell i and tell you and tell everyone here we can do well today 's trouble call we to do well the legacy of robert kennedy be a stem rebuke to the cynicism to the trivialization that grip so much of our public life today what use be it in the face of the aching problem grip million of americans the american without a job the american without health care the american without a safe street to live on or a good school to send a child to what use be it in the face of all the division that keep our country down and rob our child of their rightful future
 let we learn here once again the simple powerful beautiful lesson the simple faith of robert kennedy we can do well let we leave here no long in two place but once again in one only in the here and now with a commitment to tomorrow the only part of our time that we can control let we embrace the memory of robert kennedy by live as he would have we to live for the sake of his memory of ourselves and of all of our child and all those to come let we believe again we can do well

mr. speaker mr. president members of congress distinguished guest my fellow americans before i begin my word tonight i would like to ask that we all bow in a moment of silent prayer for the memory of those who be kill and those who have be injure in the tragic train accident in alabama today amen
 my fellow americans tonight we come together to write a new chapter in the american story our forebear enshrine the american dream life liberty the pursuit of happiness every generation of americans have work to strengthen that legacy to make our country a place of freedom and opportunity a place where people who work hard can rise to their full potential a place where their child can have a well future
 from the settling of the frontier to the landing on the moon our have be a continuous story of challenge define obstacle overcome new horizon secure that be what make america what it be and americans what we be now we be in a time of profound change and opportunity the end of the cold war the information age the global economy have bring we both opportunity and hope and strife and uncertainty our purpose in this dynamic age must be to make change our friend and not our enemy
 to achieve that goal we must face all our challenge with confidence with faith and with discipline whether we be reduce the deficit create tomorrow 's job and train our people to fill they convert from a high tech defense to a high tech domestic economy expand trade reinvent government make our street safe or rewarding work over idleness all these challenge require we to change
 if americans be to have the courage to change in a difficult time we must first be secure in our most basic need tonight i want to talk to you about the most critical thing we can do to build that security this health care system of our be badly break and it be time to fix it despite the dedication of literally million of talented health care professional our health care be too uncertain and too expensive too bureaucratic and too wasteful it have too much fraud and too much greed
 at long last after decade of false start we must make this our most urgent priority give every american health security health care that can never be take away heath care that be always there that be what we must do tonight
 on this journey as on all other of true consequence there will be rough spot in the road and honest disagreement about how we should proceed after all till be a complicated issue but every successful journey be guide by fix star and if we can agree on some basic value and principle we will reach till destination and we will reach it together
 so tonight i want to talk to you about the principle that i believe must embody our effort to reform america 's health care system security simplicity saving choice quality and responsibility
 when i launch our nation on this journey to reform the health care system i know we need a talented navigator someone with a rigorous mind a steady compass a caring heart luckily for i and for our nation i do not have to look very far
 over the last 8 month hillary and those work with she have talk to literally thousand of americans to understand the strength and the frailty of this system of ours they meet with over 1,100 health care organization they talk with doctor and nurse pharmacist and drug company representative hospital administrator insurance company executive and small and large business they speak with self employ people they talk with people who have insurance and people who do not they talk with union member and old americans and advocate for our child the first lady also consult as all of you know extensively with governmental leader in both party in the states of our nation and especially here on capitol hill hillary and the task force receive and read over 700,000 letter from ordinary citizen what they write and the bravery with which they tell their story be really what call we all here tonight
 every one of we know someone who be work hard and play by the rule and still be hurt by this system that just do not work for too many people but i would like to tell you about just one kerry kennedy own a small furniture store that employ seven people in titusville florida like most small business owner he be pour his heart and soul his sweat and blood into that business for year but over the last several year again like most small business owner he be see his health care premium skyrocket even in year when no claim be make and last year he painfully discover he could no long afford to provide coverage for all his worker because his insurance company tell he that two of his worker have become high risk because of their advanced age the problem wit that those two people be his mother and father the people who found the business and still work in the store
 this story speak for million of other and from they we have learn a powerful truth we have to preserve and strengthen what be right with the health care system but we have get to fix what be wrong with it
 now we all know what be right we be bless with the good health care professional on earth the fine health care institution the good medical research the most sophisticated technology my mother be a nurse i grow up around hospital doctor and nurse be the first professional people i ever know or learn to look up to they be what be right with this health care system but we also know that we can no long afford to continue to ignore what be wrong
 millions of americans be just a pink slip away from lose their health insurance and one serious illness away from lose all their saving million more be lock into the job they have now just because they or someone in their family have once be sick and they have what be call the preexisting condition and on any give day over 37 million americans most of they work people and their little child have no health insurance at all
 and in spite of all this our medical bill be grow at over twice the rate of inflation and the united states spend over a third more of its income on health care than any other nation on earth and the gap be grow cause many of our company in global competition severe disadvantage there be no excuse for this kind of system we know other people have do well we know people in our own country be do well we have no excuse my fellow americans we must fix this system and it have to begin with congressional action
 i believe as strongly as i can say that we can reform the costly and most wasteful system on the face of the earth without enact new broad base taxis i believe it because of the conversation i have have with thousand of health care professional around the country with people who be outside this city but be inside expert on the way this system work and waste money
 the proposal that i describe tonight borrow many of the principle and idea that have be embrace in plan introduce by both republicans and democrats in this congress for the first time in this century leader of both political party have join together around the principle of provide universal comprehensive health care it be a magic moment and we must seize it
 i want to say to all of you i have be deeply move by the spirit of this debate by the openness of all people to new idea and argument and information the american people would he proud to know that early this week when a health care university be hold for member of congress just to try to give everybody the same amount of information over 320 republicans and democrats sign up and show up for 2 day just to learn the basic fact of the complicated problem before we
 both side be willing to say we have listen to the people we know the cost of go forward with this system be far great than the cost of change both side i think understand the literal ethical imperative of do something about the system we have now rise above these difficulty and our past difference to solve this problem will go a long way toward define who we be and who we intend to be as a people in this difficult and challenging era i believe we all understand that and so tonight let i ask all of you every member of the house every member of the senate each republican and each democrat let we keep this spirit and let we keep this commitment until this job be do we owe it to the american people applause
 thank you thank you very much
 now if i might i would like to review the six principle i mention early and describe how we think we can well fulfill those principle
 first and most important security this principle speak to the human misery to the cost to the anxiety we hear about every day all of we when people talk about their problem with the present system security mean that those who do not now have health care coverage will have it and for those who have it it will never be take away we must achieve that security as soon as possible
 under our plan every american would receive a health care security card that will guarantee a comprehensive package of benefit over the course of an entire lifetime roughly comparable to the benefit package offer by most fortune 500 company this health care security card will offer this package of benefit in a way that can never be take away so let we agree on this whatever else we disagree on before this congress finish its work next year you will pass and i will sign legislation to guarantee this security to every citizen of this country
 with this card if you lose your job or you switch job you be cover if you leave your job to start a small business you be cover if you be an early retiree you be cover if someone in your family have unfortunately have an illness that qualify as a preexisting condition you be still cover if you get sick or a member of your family get sick even if it be a life threaten illness you be cover and if an insurance company try to drop you for any reason you will still be cover because that will be illegal this card will give comprehensive coverage it will cover people for hospital care doctor visit emergency and lab service diagnostic service like pap smear and mammogram and cholesterol test substance abuse and mental health treatment
 and equally important for both health care and economic reason this program for the first time would provide a broad range of preventive service include regular checkup and well baby visit now it be just common sense we know any family doctor will tell you that people will stay healthy and long term cost of the health system will be low if we have comprehensive preventive service you know how all of our mother tell we that an ounce of prevention be worth a pound of cure our mother be right and it be a lesson like so many lesson from our mother that we have wait too long to live by it be time to start do it
 health care security must also apply to old americans this be something i imagine all of we in this room feel very deeply about the first thing i want to say about that be that we must maintain the medicare program it work to provide that kind of security but this time and for the first time i believe medicare should provide coverage for the cost of prescription drug
 yes it will cost some more in the beginning but again any physician who deal with the elderly will tell you that there be thousand of elderly people in every state who be not poor enough to be on medicaid but just above that line and on medicare who desperately need medicine who make decision every week between medicine and food any doctor who deal with the elderly will tell you that there be many elderly people who do not get medicine who get sicker and sicker and eventually go to the doctor and wind up spend more money and drain more money from the health care system than they would if they have regular treatment in the way that only adequate medicine can provide
 i also believe that over time we should phase in long term care for the disabled and the elderly on a comprehensive basis as we proceed with this health care reform we can not forget that the most rapidly grow percentage of americans be those over 80 we can not break faith with they we have to do well by they
 the second principle be simplicity our heath care system must be simple for the patient and simple for those who actually deliver health care our doctor our nurse our other medical professional today we have more than 1,500 insurer with hundred and hundred of different form no other nation have a system like this these form be time consume for health care provider they be expensive for health care consumer they be exasperate for anyone who be ever try to sit down around a table and wade through they and figure they out
 the medical care industry be literally drown in paperwork in recent year the number of administrator in our hospital have grow by 4 time the rate that the number of doctor have grow a hospital ought to be a house of healing not a monument to paperwork and bureaucracy
 just a few day ago the vice president and i have the honor of visit the children 's hospital here in washington where they do wonderful often miraculous thing for very sick child a nurse name debbie freiberg tell we that she be in the cancer and bone marrow unit the other day a little boy ask she just to stay at his side during his chemotherapy and she have to walk away from that child because she have be instruct to go to yet another class to learn how to fill out another form for something that do not have a lick to do with the health care of the child she be help that be wrong and we can stop it and we ought to do it
 we meet a very compelling doctor name lillian beard a pediatrician who say that she do not get into her profession to spend hour and hour some doctor up to 25 hour a week just fill out form she tell we she become a doctor to keep child well and to help save those who get sick we can relieve people like she of this burden we learn the vice president and i do that in the washington children 's hospital alone the administrator tell we they spend $ 2 million a year in one hospital fill out form that have nothing whatever to do with keep up with the treatment of the patient
 and the doctor there applaud when i be tell and i relate to they that they spend so much time fill out paperwork that if they only have to fill out those paperwork requirement necessary to monitor the heath of the child each doctor on that one hospital staff 200 of they could see another 500 child a year that be 10,000 child a year i think we can save money in this system if we simplify it and we can make the doctor and the nurse and the people that be give their life to help we all be healthy a whole lot happy too on their job
 under our proposal there would be one standard insurance form not hundred of they we will simplify also and we must the government 's rule and regulation because they be a big part of this problem this be one of those case where the physician should heal thyself we have to reinvent the way we relate to the health care system along with reinvent government a doctor should not have to check with a bureaucrat in an office thousand of mile away before order a simple blood test that be not right and we can change it and doctor nurse and consumer should not have to worry about the fine print if we have this one simple form there will not be any fine print people will know what it mean
 the third principle be saving reform must produce saving in this health care system it have to we be spend over 14 percent of our income on health care canada 's at 10 nobody else be over 9 we be compete with all these people for the future and the other major country they cover everybody and they cover they with service as generous as the good company policy here in this country
 rampant medical inflation be eat away at our wage our saving our investment capital our ability to create new job in the private sector and this public treasury you know the budget we just adopt have steep cut in defense a 5 year freeze on the discretionary spending so critical to reeducate america and invest in job and help we to convert from a defense to a domestic economy but we pass a budget which have medicaid increase of between 16 and 11 percent a year over the next 5 year and medicare increase of between 11 and 9 percent in an environment where we assume inflation will be at 4 percent or less we can not continue to do this our competitiveness our whole economy the integrity of the way the government work and ultimately our living standard depend upon our ability to achieve saving without harm the quality of heath care
 unless we do this our worker will lose $ 655 in income each year by the end of the decade small business will continue to face skyrocket premium and a full third of small business now cover their employee say they will be force to drop their insurance large corporation will bear big disadvantage in global competition and health care cost devour more and more and more of our budget pretty soon all of you or the people who succeed you will be show up here and write out check for health care and interest on the debt and worry about whether we have get enough defense and that will be it unless we have the courage to achieve the saving that be plainly there before we every state and local government will continue to cut back on everything from education to law enforcement to pay more and more for the same health care
 these rise cost be a special nightmare for our small business the engine of our entrepreneurship and our job creation in america today health care premium for small business be 35 percent high than those of large corporation today and they will keep rise at double digit rate unless we act
 so how will we achieve these saving rather than look at price control or look away as the price spiral continue rather than use the heavy hand of government to try to control what be happen or continue to ignore what be happen we believe there be a third way to achieve these saving first to give group of consumer and small business the same market bargaining power that large corporation and large group of public employee now have we want to let market force enable plan to compete we want to force these plan to compete on the basis of price and quality not simply to allow they to continue make money by turn people away who be sick or old or perform mountain of unnecessary procedure but we also believe we should back this system up with limit on how much plan can raise their premium year in and year out force people again to continue to pay more for the same health care without regard to inflation or the rise population need
 we want to create what have be miss in this system for too long and what every successful nation who have deal with this problem have already have to do to have a combination of private market force and a sound public policy that will support that competition but limit the rate at which price can exceed the rate of inflation and population growth if the competition do not work especially in the early going
 the second thing i want to say be that unless everybody be cover and this be a very important thing unless everybody be cover we will never be able to fully put the brake on health care inflation why be that because when people do not have any health insurance they still get health care but they get it when it be too late when it be too expensive often from the most expensive place of all the emergency room usually by the time they show up their illness be more severe and their mortality rate be much high in our hospital than those who have insurance so they cost we more and what else happen since they get the care but they do not pay who do pay all the rest of we we pay in high hospital bill and high insurance premium this cost shifting be a major problem
 the third thing we can do to save money be simply by simplify the system what we have already discuss free the health care provider from these costly and unnecessary paperwork and administrative decision will save ten of billion of dollar we spend twice as much as any other major country do on paperwork we spend at least a dime on the dollar more than any other major country that be a stunning statistic it be something that every republican and every democrat ought to be able to say we agree that we be go to squeeze this out
 we can not tolerate this this have nothing to do with keep people well or help they when they be sick we should invest the money in something else
 we also have to crack down on fraud and abuse in the system that drain billion of dollar a year it be a very large figure accord to every health care expert i have ever speak with so i believe we can achieve large saving
 and that large saving can be use to cover the unemployed uninsured and will be use for people who realize those saving in the private sector to increase their ability to invest and grow to hire new worker or to give their worker pay raise many of they for the first time in year
 now nobody have to take my word for this you can ask dr. koop he be up here with we tonight and i thank he for be here since he leave his distinguished tenure as our surgeon general he have spend an enormous amount of time study our health care system how it operate what be right and wrong with it he say we could spend $ 200 billion every year more than 20 percent of the total budget without sacrifice the high quality of american medicine
 ask the public employee in california who have hold their own premium down by adopt the same strategy that i want every american to be able to adopt bargaining within the limit of a strict budget ask xerox which save an estimate $ 1,000 per worker on their health insurance premium ask the staff of the mayo clinic who we all agree provide some of the fine health care in the world they be hold their cost increase to less than half the national average ask the people of hawaii the only state that cover virtually all of their citizen and have still be able to keep cost below the national average
 people may disagree over the good way to fix this system we may all disagree about how quickly we can do the thing that we have to do but we can not disagree that we can find ten of billion of dollar in saving in what be clearly the most costly and the most bureaucratic system in the entire world and we have to do something about that and we have to do it now
 the fourth principle be choice americans believe they ought to be able to choose their own health care plan and keep their own doctor and i think all of we agree under any plan we pass they ought to have that right but today under our break heath care system in spite of the rhetoric of choice the fact be that that power be slip away for more and more americans
 of course it be usually the employer not the employee who make the initial choice of what health care plan the employee will be in and if your employer offer only one plan as nearly three quarter of small or medium sized firm do today you be stick with that plan and the doctor that it cover
 i propose to give every american a choice among high quality plan you can stay with your current doctor join a network of doctor and hospital or join a health maintenance organization if you do not like your plan every year you will have a chance to choose a new one the choice will be leave to the american citizen the worker not the boss and certainly not some government bureaucrat
 we also believe that doctor should have a choice as to what plan they practice in otherwise citizen may have their own choice limit we want to end the discrimination that be now grow against doctor and to permit they to practice in several different plan choice be important for doctor and it be absolutely critical for our consumer we have get to have it in whatever plan we pass
 the fifth principle be quality if we reform everything else in health care but fail to preserve and enhance the high quality of our medical care we will have take a step backward not forward quality be something that we simply can not leave to chance when you board an airplane you feel well know that the plane have to meet standard design to protect your safety and we can not ask any less of our health care system
 our proposal will create report card on health plan so that consumer can choose the high quality health care provider and reward they with their business at the same time our plan will track quality indicator so that doctor can make well and smart choice of the kind of care they provide we have evidence that more efficient delivery of health care do not decrease quality in fact it may enhance it
 let i just give you one example of one commonly perform procedure the coronary bypass operation pennsylvania discover that patient who be charge $ 21,000 for this surgery receive as good or well care as patient who be charge $ 84,000 for the same procedure in the same state high price simply do not always equal good quality our plan will guarantee that high quality information be available in even the most remote area of this country so that we can have high quality service link rural doctor for example with hospital with high tech urban medical center and our plan will ensure the quality of continue progress on a whole range of issue by speed research on effective prevention and treatment measure for cancer for aids for alzheimer 's for heart disease and for other chronic disease we have to safeguard the fine medical research establishment in the entire world and we will do that with this plan indeed we will even make it well
 the sixth and final principle be responsibility we need to restore a sense that we be all in this together and that we all have a responsibility to be a part of the solution responsibility have to start with those who profit from the current system responsibility mean insurance company should no long be allow to cast people aside when they get sick it should apply to laboratory that submit fraudulent bill to lawyer who abuse malpractice claim to doctor who order unnecessary procedure it mean drug company should no long charge 3 time more per prescription drug make in america here in the united states than they charge for the same drug overseas
 in short responsibility should apply to anybody who abuse this system and drive up the cost for honest hard work citizen and undermine confidence in the honest gifted health care provider we have responsibility also mean change some behavior in this country that drive up our cost like crazy and without change it we will never bare the system we ought to have we will never
 let i just mention a few and start with the most important the outrageous cost of violence in this country stein in large measure from the fact that this be the only country in the world where teenager can rout the street at random with semiautomatic weapon and be well armed than the police
 but let us not kid ourselves it be not that simple we also have high rate of aids of smoking and excessive drinking of teen pregnancy of low birth weight baby and we have the third bad immunization rate of any nation in the western hemisphere we have to change our way if we ever really want to be healthy as a people and have an affordable health care system and no one can deny that
 but let i say this and i hope every american will listen because this be not an easy thing to hear responsibility in our health care system be not just about they it be about you it be about i it be about each of we too many of we have not take responsibility for our own health care and for our own relation to the health care system many of we who have have fully pay health care plan have use the system whether we need it or not without think what the cost be many people who use this system do not pay a penny for their care even though they can afford to i think those who do not have any health insurance should be responsible for pay a portion of their new coverage there can not be any something for nothing and we have to demonstrate that to people this be not a free system even small contribution as small as the $ 10 copayment when you visit a doctor illustrate that this be something of value there be a cost to it it be not free
 and i want to tell you that i believe that all of we should have insurance why should the rest of we pick up the tab when a guy who do not think he need insurance or say he can not afford it get in an accident wind up in an emergency room get good care and everybody else pay why should the small business people who be struggle to keep afloat and take care of their employee have to pay to maintain this wonderful health care infrastructure for those who refuse to do anything if we be go to produce a well health care system for every one of we every one of we be go to have to do our part there can not be any such thing as a free ride we have to pay for it we have to pay for it
 tonight i want to say plainly how i think we should do that most of the money will come under my way of thinking as it do today from premium pay by employer and individual that be the way it happen today but under this health care security plan every employer and every individual will be ask to contribute something to health care
 this concept be first convey to the congress about 20 year ago by president nixon and today a lot of people agree with the concept of share responsibility between employer and employee and that the good thing to do be to ask every employer and every employee to share that the chamber of commerce have say that and they be not in the business of hurt small business the american medical association have say that
 some call it an employer mandate but i think it be the fair way to achieve responsibility in the heath care system and it be the easy for ordinary americans to understand because it build on what we already have and what already work for so many americans it be the reform that be not only easy to understand but easy to implement in a way that be fair to small business because we can give a discount to help struggle small business meet the cost of cover their employee we should require the east bureaucracy or disruption and create the cooperation we need to make the system cost conscious even as we expand coverage and we should do it in a way that do not cripple small business and low wage worker
 every employer should provide coverage just as three quarter do now those that pay be pick up the tab for those who do not today i do not think that be right to finance the rest of reform we can achieve new saving as i have outline in both the federal government and the private sector through well decision making and increase competition and we will impose new taxis on tobacco i do not think that should be the only source of revenue i believe we should also ask for a modest contribution from big employer who opt out of the system to make up for what those who be in the system pay for medical research for health education center for all the subsidy to small business for all the thing that everyone else be contribute to but between those two thing we believe we can pay for this package of benefit and universal coverage and a subsidy program that will help small business
 these source can cover the cost of the proposal that i have describe tonight we subject the number in our proposal to the scrutiny of not only all the major agency in government i know a lot of people do not trust they but it would be interesting for the american people to know that this be the first time that the financial expert on health care in all of the different government agency have ever be require to sit in the room together and agree on number it have never happen before but obviously that be not enough so then we give these number to actuary from major accounting firm and major fortune 500 company who have no stake in this other than to see that our effort succeed so i believe our number be good and achievable
 now what do this mean to an individual american citizen some will be ask to pay more if you be an employer and you be not insure your worker at all you will have to pay more but if you be a small business with few than 50 employee you will get a subsidy if you be a firm that provide only very limited coverage you may have to pay more but some firm will pay the same or less for more coverage
 if you be a young single person in your twenty and you be already insure your rate may go up somewhat because you be go to go into a big pool with middle aged people and old people and we want to enable people to keep their insurance even when someone in their family get sick but i think that be fair because when the young get old they will benefit from it first and secondly even those who pay a little more today will benefit 4 5 6 7 year from now by our bring health care cost close to inflation
 over the long run we can all win but some will have to pay more in the short run nevertheless the vast majority of the americans watch this tonight will pay the same or less for health care coverage that will be the same or well than the coverage they have tonight that be the central reality
 if you currently get your health insurance through your job under our plan you still will and for the first time everybody will get to choose from among at least three plan to belong to if you be a small business owner who want to provide health insurance to your family and your employee but you can not afford it because the system be stack against you this plan will give you a discount that will finally make insurance affordable if you be already provide insurance your rate may well drop because we will help you as a small business person join thousand of other to get the same benefit big corporation get at the same price they get those benefit if you be self employ you will pay less and you will get to deduct from your taxis 100 percent of your health care premium if you be a large employer your health care cost will not go up as fast so that you will have more money to put into high wage and new job and to put into the work of be competitive in this tough global economy
 now these my fellow americans be the principle on which i think we should base our effort security simplicity saving choice quality and responsibility these be the guide star that we should follow on our journey toward health care reform
 over the come month you will be bombard with information from all kind of source there will be some who will stoutly disagree with what i have propose and with all other plan in the congress for that matter and some of the argument will be genuinely sincere and enlightening other may simply be scare tactic by those who be motivate by the self interest they have in the waste the system now generate because that waste be provide job income and money for some people i ask you only to think of this when you hear all of these argument ask yourself whether the cost of stay on this same course be not great than the cost of change and ask yourself when you hear the argument whether the argument be in your interest or someone else 's this be something we have get to try to do together
 i want also to say to the representatives in congress you have a special duty to look beyond these argument i ask you instead to look into the eye of the sick child who need care to think of the face of the woman who be be tell not only that her condition be malignant but not cover by her insurance to look at the bottom line of the business drive to bankruptcy by health care cost to look at the for sale sign in front of the home of family who have lose everything because of their health care cost
 i ask you to remember the kind of people i meet over the last year and a half the elderly couple in new hampshire that break down and cry because of their shame at have an empty refrigerator to pay for their drag a woman who lose a $ 50,000 job that she use to support her six child because her young child be so ill that she could not keep health insurance and the only way to get care for the child be to get public assistance a young couple that have a sick child and could only get insurance from one of the parent employer that be a nonprofit corporation with 20 employee and so they have to face the question of whether to let this poor person with a sick child go or raise the premium of every employee in the firm by $ 200 and on and on and on
 i know we have difference of opinion but we be here tonight in a spirit that be animate by the problem of those people and by the sheer knowledge that if we can look into our heart we will not be able to say that the great nation in the history of the world be powerless to confront this crisis
 our history and our heritage tell we that we can meet this challenge everything about america 's past tell we we will do it so i say to you let we write that new chapter in the american story let we guarantee every american comprehensive health benefit that can never be take away
 you know in spite of all the work we have do together and all the progress we have make there be still a lot of people who say it would be an outright miracle if we pass health care reform but my fellow americans in a time of change you have to have miracle and miracle do happen i mean just a few day ago we see a simple handshake shatter decade of deadlock in the middle east we have see the wall crumble in berlin and south africa we see the ongoing brave struggle of the people of russia to seize freedom and democracy
 and now it be our turn to strike a blow for freedom in this country the freedom of americans to live without fear that their own nation 's health care system will not be there for they when they need it it be hard to believe that there be once a time in this century when that kind of fear grip old age when retirement be nearly synonymous with poverty and old americans die in the street that be unthinkable today because over a half a century ago americans have the courage to change to create a social security system that ensure that no americans will be forget in their later year
 forty year from now our grandchild will also find it unthinkable that there be a time in this country when hardworke family lose their home their saving their business lose everything simply because their child get sick or because they have to change job our grandchild will find such thing unthinkable tomorrow if we have the courage to change today
 this be our chance this be our journey and when our work be do we will know that we have answer the call of history and meet the challenge of our time
 thank you very much and god bless america

my fellow americans
 today i want to talk with you about our nation 's military involvement in somalia a year ago we all watch with horror as somali child and their family lie die by the ten of thousand die the slow agonizing death of starvation a starvation bring on not only by drought but also by the anarchy that then prevail in that country
 this past weekend we all react with anger and horror as an armed somali gang desecrate the body of our american soldier and display a capture american pilot all of they soldier who be take part in an international effort to end the starvation of the somali people themselves these tragic event raise hard question about our effort in somalia why be we still there what be we try to accomplish how do a humanitarian mission turn violent and when will our people come home
 these question deserve straight answer let us start by remember why our troop go into somalia in the first place we go because only the united states could help stop one of the great human tragedy of this time a third of a million people have die of starvation and disease twice that many more be at risk of die meanwhile ton of relief supply pile up in the capital of mogadishu because a small number of somalis stop food from reach their own countryman
 our conscience say enough in our nation 's good tradition we take action with bipartisan support president bush send in 28,000 american troop as part of a united nations humanitarian mission our troop create a secure environment so that food and medicine could get through we save close to one million life and throughout most of somalia everywhere but in mogadishu life begin return to normal crop be grow market be reopen so be school and hospital nearly a million somalis still depend completely on relief supply but at least the starvation be go and none of this would have happen without american leadership and america 's troop
 until june thing go well with little violence the united states reduce our troop presence from 28,000 down to less than 5,000 with other nation pick up where we leave off but then in june the people who cause much of the problem in the beginning start attack american pakistani and other troop who be there just to keep the peace
 rather than participate in build the peace with other these people seek to fight and to disrupt even if it mean return somalia to anarchy and mass famine and make no mistake about it if we be to leave somalia tomorrow other nation would leave too chaos would resume the relief effort would stop and starvation soon would return
 that knowledge have lead we to continue our mission it be not our job to rebuild somalia 's society or even to create a political process that can allow somalia 's clan to live and work in peace the somalis must do that for themselves the united nations and many african state be more than willing to help but we we in the united states must decide whether we will give they enough time to have a reasonable chance to succeed
 we start this mission for the right reason and we be go to finish it in the right way in a sense we come to somalia to rescue innocent people in a burn house we have nearly put the fire out but some smolder ember remain if we leave they now those ember will reignite into flame and people will die again if we stay a short while long and do the right thing we have get a reasonable chance of cool off the ember and get other firefighter to take our place
 we also have to recognize that we can not leave now and still have all our troop present and account for and i want you to know that i be determined to work for the security of those americans miss or hold captive anyone hold an american fight now should understand above all else that we will hold they strictly responsible for our soldier well being we expect they to be well treat and we expect they to be release
 so now we face a choice do we leave when the job get tough or when the job be well do do we invite a return of mass suffering or do we leave in a way that give the somalis a decent chance to survive
 recently general colin powell say this about our choice in somalia because thing get difficult you do not cut and rim you work the problem and try to find a correct solution i want to bring our troop home from somalia before the event of this week as i say we have already reduce the number of our troop there from 28,000 to less than 5,000 we must complete that withdrawal soon and i will but we must also leave on our term we must do it right and here be what i intend to do
 this past week 's event make it clear that even as we prepare to withdraw from somalia we need more strength there we need more armor more air power to ensure that our people be safe and that we can do our job today i have order 1,700 additional army troop and 104 additional armored vehicle to somalia to protect our troop and to complete our mission i have also order an aircraft carrier and two amphibious group with 3,600 combat marines to be station offshore these force will be under american command
 their mission what i be ask these young americans to do be the follow
 first they be there to protect our troop and our basis we do not go to somalia with a military purpose we never want to kill anyone but those who attack our soldier must know they will pay a very heavy price
 second they be there to keep open and secure the road the port and the line of communication that be essential for the united nations and the relief worker to keep the flow of food and supply and people move freely throughout the country so that starvation and anarchy do not return
 third they be there to keep the pressure on those who cut off relief supply and attack our people not to personalize the conflict but to prevent a return to anarchy
 fourth through their pressure and their presence our troop will help to make it possible for the somali people work with other to reach agreement among themselves so that they can solve their problem and survive when we leave that be our mission
 i be propose this plan because it will let we finish leave somalia on our own term and without destroy all that two administration have accomplish there for if we be to leave today we know what would happen within month somali child again would be die in the street our own credibility with friend and ally would be severely damage our leadership in world affair would be undermine at the very time when people be look to america to help promote peace and freedom in the post cold war world and all around the world aggressor thug and terrorist will conclude that the good way to get we to change our policy be to kill our people it would be open season on americans
 that be why i be committed to get this job do in somalia not only quickly but also effectively to do that i be take step to ensure troop from other nation be ready to take the place of our own soldier we have already withdraw some 20,000 troop and more than that number have replace they from over two dozen other nation now we will intensify effort to have other country deploy more troop to somalia to assure that security will remain when we be go
 and we will complete the replacement of u.s. military logistic personnel with civilian contractor who can provide the same support to the united nations while we be take military step to protect our own people and to help the u.n. maintain a secure environment we must pursue new diplomatic effort to help the somalis find a political solution to their problem that be the only kind of outcome that can endure
 for fundamentally the solution to somalia 's problem be not a military one it be political leader of the neighboring african state such as ethiopia and eritrea have offer to take the lead in effort to build a settlement among the somali people that can preserve order and security i have direct my representative to pursue such effort vigorously and i have ask ambassador bob oakley who serve effectively in two administration as our representative in somalia to travel again to the region immediately to advance this process
 obviously even then there be no guarantee that somalia will rid itself of violence and suffering but at least we will have give somalia a reasonable chance this week some 15,000 somalis take to the street to express sympathy for our loss to thank we for our effort most somalis be not hostile to we but grateful and they want to use this opportunity to rebuild their country
 it be my judgment and that of my military adviser that we may need up to 6 month to complete these step and to conduct an orderly withdrawal we will do what we can to complete the mission before then all american troop will be out of somalia no later than march the 31st except for a few hundred support personnel in noncombat role
 if we take these step if we take the time to do the job right i be convinced we will have live up to the responsibility of american leadership in the word and we will have prove that we be committed to address the new problem of a new era
 when out troop in somalia come under fire this last weekend we witness a dramatic example of the heroic ethic of our american military when the first black hawk helicopter be down this weekend the other american troop do not retreat although they could have some 90 of they form a perimeter around the helicopter and they hold that ground under intensely heavy fire they stay with their comrade that be the kind of soldier they be that be the kind of people we be
 so let we finish the work we set out to do let we demonstrate to the world as generation of americans have do before we that when americans take on a challenge they do the job right
 let i express my thank and my gratitude and my profound sympathy to the family of the young americans who be kill in somalia my message to you be your country be grateful and so be the rest of the word and so be the vast majority of the somali people our mission from this day forward be to increase our strength do our job bring our soldier out and bring they home
 thank you and god bless america

 you know in the last 10 month i have be call a lot of thing but nobody be call i a bishop yet laughter when i be about 9 year old my beloved and now depart grandmother who be a very wise woman look at i and she say you know i believe you could be a preacher if you be just a little well boy laughter

 proverbs say a happy heart doeth good like medicine but a broken spirit dryeth the bone this be a happy place and i be happy to be here i thank you for your spirit

 by the grace of god and your help last year i be elect president of this great country i never dream that i would ever have a chance to come to this hallowed place where martin luther king give his last sermon i ask you to think today about the purpose for which i run and the purpose for which so many of you work to put i in this great office i have work hard to keep faith with our common effort to restore the economy to reverse the politic of help only those at the top of our totem pole and not the hard work middle class or the poor to bring our people together across racial and regional and political line to make a strength out of our diversity instead of let it tear we apart to reward work and family and community and try to move we forward into the 21st century i have try to keep faith

 thirteen percent of all my presidential appointment be african americans and there be five african americans in the cabinet of the united states 2 1/2 time as many as have ever serve in the history of this great land i have seek to advance the right to vote with the motor voter bill support so strongly by all the church in our country and next week it will be my great honor to sign the restoration of religious freedom act a bill support widely by people across all religion and political philosophy to put back the real meaning of the constitution to give you and every other american the freedom to do what be most important in your life to worship god as your spirit lead you

 i say to you my fellow americans we have make a good beginning inflation be clown interest rate be down the deficit be down investment be up million of americans include i bet some people in this room have refinance their home or their business loan just in the last year and in the last 10 month this economy bas produce more job in the private sector than in the previous 4 year

 we have pass a law call the family leave law which say you can not be fire if you take a little time off when a baby be bear or a parent be sick we know that most americans have to work but you ought not to have to give up be a good parent just to take a job if you can not succeed as a worker and a parent this country can not make it

 we have radically reform the college loan program as i promise to lower the cost of college loan and broaden the availability of it and make the repayment term easy and we have pass the national service law that will give in 3 year 3 year from now 100,000 young americans the chance to serve their community at home to repair the fray bond of community to build up the need of people at the grassroot and at the same time earn some money to pay for a college education it be a wonderful idea

 on april 15th when people pay their taxis somewhere between 15 million and 18 million work family on modest income family with child and income of tinder $ 23,000 will get a tax cut not a tax increase in the most important effort to ensure that we reward work and family in the last 20 year fifty million american parent and their child will be advantage by put the tax code back on the side of work american parent for a change

 under the leadership of the first lady we have produce a comprehensive plan to guarantee health care security to all americans how can we expect the american people to work and to live with all the change in a global economy where the average 18 year old will change work seven time in a lifetime unless we can simply say we have join the rank of all the other advanced country in the world you can have decent health care that be always there that can never be take away it be time we do that long past time i ask you to help we achieve that

 but we have so much more to do you and i know that most people be still work hard for the same or low wage that many people be afraid that their job will go away we have to provide the education and train our people need not just for our child but for our adult too if we can not close this country up to the force of change sweep throughout the world we have to at least guarantee people the security of be employable they have to be able to get a new job if they be go to have to get a new job we do not do that today and we must and we intend to proceed until that be do

 we have a guarantee that there will be some investment in those area of our country in the inner city and in the destitute rural area in the mississippi delta of my borne state and this state and louisiana and mississippi and other place like it throughout america it be all very well to train people but if they do not have a job they can be train for nothing we must get investment into those place where the people be die for work

 and finally let i say we must find people who will buy what we have to produce we be the most productive people on earth that make we proud but what that mean be that every year one person can produce more in the same amount of time now if few and few people can produce more and more thing and yet you want to create more job and raise people 's income you have to have more customer for what it be you be make and that be why i have work so hard to sell more american product around the world why i have ask that we be able to sell billion of dollar of computer we use not to sell to foreign country and foreign interest to put our people to work why next week i be go all the way to washington state to meet with the president of china and the prime minister of japan and the head of 13 other asian country the fast grow part of the world to say we want to be your partner we will buy your good but we want you to buy ours too if you please that be why

 that be why i have work so hard for this north american trade agreement that congressman ford endorse today and congressman jefferson endorse and congressman cooper and congressman clement because we know that americans can compete and win only if people will buy what it be we have to sell there be 90 million people in mexico seventy cent of every dollar they spend on foreign good they spend on american good

 people worry fairly about people shut down plant in america and go not just to mexico but to any place where the labor be cheap it have happen what i want to say to you my fellow americans be nothing in this agreement make that more likely that have happen already it may happen again what we need to do be keep the job here by find customer there that be what this agreement do it give we a chance to create opportunity for people i have friend in this audience people who be minister from my state father and son people?i've look out all over this vast crowd and i see people i have know for year they know i spend my whole life work to create job i would never knowingly do anything that would take a job away from the american people this agreement will make more job now we can also leave it if it do not work in 6 month but if we do not take it we will lose it forever we need to take it because we have to do well

 but i guess what i really want to say to you today my fellow americans be that we can do all of this and still fail unless we meet the great crisis of the spirit that be grip america today

 when i leave you congressman ford and i be go to a baptist church near here to a town meeting he be have on health care and violence i tell you unless we do something about crime and violence and drug that be ravage the community we will not be able to repair this country

 if martin luther king who say like moses i be on the mountaintop and i can see the promise land but i be not go to be able to get there with you but we will get there"?if he be to reappear by my side today and give we a report card on the last 25 year what would he say you do a good job he would say vote and elect people who formerly be not electable because of the color of their skin you have more political power and that be good you do a good job he would say let people who have the ability to do so live wherever they want to live go wherever they want to go in this great country you do a good job he would say elevate people of color into the rank of the united states armed forces to the very top or into the very top of our government you do a very good job he would say he would say you do a good job create a black middle class of people who really be do well and the middle class be grow more among african americans than among non african americans you do a good job you do a good job in open opportunity

 but he would say i do not live and die to see the american family destroy i do not live and die to see 13 year old boy get automatic weapon and gun down 9 year old just for the kick of it i do not live and die to see young people destroy their own life with drug and then build fortune destroy the life of other that be not what i come here to do i fight for freedom he would say but not for the freedom of people to kill each other with reckless abandon not for the freedom of child to have child and the father of the child walk away from they and abandon they as if they do not amount to anything i fight for people to have the right to work but not to have whole community and people abandon this be not what i live and die for

 my fellow americans he would say i fight to stop white people from be so fill with hate that they would wreak violence on black people i do not fight for the right of black people to murder other black people with reckless abandon

 the other day the mayor of baltimore a dear friend of mine tell i a story of visit the family of a young man who have be kill 18 year old?on halloween he always go out with little bitty kid so they could trick or treat safely and across the street from where they be walk on halloween a 14 year old boy give a 13 year old boy a gun and dare he to shoot the 18 year old boy and he shoot he dead and the mayor have to visit the family

 in washington dc where i live your nation 's capital the symbol of freedom throughout the world look how that freedom be be exercise the other night a man come along the street and grab a 1 year old child and put the child in his car the child may have be the child of the man and two people be after he and they chase he in the car and they just keep shoot with reckless abandon know that baby be in the car and they shoot the man dead and a bullet go through his body into the baby 's body and blow the little bootie off the child 's foot

 the other day on the front page of our paper the nation 's capita be we talk about world peace or world conflict no big article on the front page of the washington post about an 11 year old child plan her funeral these be the hymn i want sing this be the tress i want to wear i know i be not go to live very long that be not the freedom the freedom to die before you be a teenager be not what martin luther king live and die for

 more than 37,000 people die from gunshot wound in this country every year gunfire be the lead cause of death in young man and now that we have all get so cool that everybody can get a semiautomatic weapon a person shoot now be 3 time more likely to die than 15 year ago because they be likely to have three bullet in they a hundred and sixty thousand child stay home from school every day because they be scared they will be hurt in their school

 the other day i be in california at a town meeting and a handsome young man stand up and say mr. president my brother and i we do not belong to gang we do not have gun we do not do drug we want to go to school we want to he professional we want to work hard we want to do well we want to have family and we change our school because the school we be in be so dangerous so when we stow up to the new school to register my brother and i be stand in line and somebody run into the school and start shoot a gun my brother be shoot down stand right in front of i at the safe school the freedom to do that kind of thing be not what martin luther king live and die for not what people gather in this hallowed church for the night before he be assassinate in april of 1968 if you have tell anybody who be here in that church on that night that we would abuse our freedom in that way they would have find it hard to believe and i tell you it be our moral duty to turn it around

 and now i think finally we have a chance finally i think we have a chance we have a pastor here from new haven connecticut i be in his church with reverend jackson when i be run for president on a snowy day in connecticut to mourn the death of child who have be kill in that city and afterward we walk down the street for more than a mile in the snow then the american people be not ready people would say oh this be a terrible thing but what can we do about it

 now when we react that foreign visitor come to our shore and be kill at random in our fine state of florida when we see our child plan their funeral when the american people be finally come to grip with the accumulate weight of crime and violence and the breakdown of family and community and the increase in drug and the decrease in job i think finally we may be ready to do something about it

 anti there be something for each of we to do there be change we eau make from the outside in that be the job of the president the congress and the governors and the mayor and the social service agency and then there be some change we be go to have to make from the inside out or the other will not matter that be what that magnificent song be about be not it sometimes there be no answer from the outside in sometimes all the answer have to come from the value and the stirring and the voice that speak to we from within

 so we be begin we be try to pass a bill to make our people safe to put another 100,000 police officer on the street to provide boot camp instead of prison for young people who can still be rescue to provide more safety in our school to restrict the availability of these awful assault weapon to pass the brady hill and at least require people to have their criminal background check before they get a gun and to say if you be not old enough to vote and you be not old enough to go to war you ought not to own a handgun and you ought not to use one unless you be on a target range

 we want to pass a health care bill that will make drug treatment available for everyone and we also have to do it we have to have drug treatment and education available to everyone and especially those who be in prison who be come out we have a drug czar now in lee brown who be the police chief of atlanta of houston of new york who understand these thing and when the congress come back next year we will be move forward on that

 we need this crime bill now we ought to give it to the american people for christmas and we need to move forward on all these other front but i say to you my fellow americans we need some other thing as well i do not believe we can repair the basic fabric of society until people who be willing to work have work work organize life it give structure and discipline to life it give meaning and self esteem to people who be parent it give a role model to child

 the famous african american sociologist william julius wilson have write a stunning book call the truly disadvantaged in which he chronicle in breathtake term how the inner city of our country have crumble as work have disappear and we must find a way through public and private source to enhance the attractiveness of the american people who live there to get investment there we can not i submit to you repair the american community and restore the american family until we provide the structure the value the discipline and the reward that work give

 i read a wonderful speech the other day give at howard university in a lecture series fund by bill and camille cosby in which the speaker say i grow up in anacostia year ago even then it be all black and it be a very poor neighborhood but you know when i be a child in anacostia a 100 percent african american neighborhood a very poor neighborhood we have a crime rate that be low than the average of the crime rate of our city why because we have coherent family we have coherent community the people who fill the church on sunday live in the same place they go to church the guy that own the drugstore live clown the street the person that own the grocery store live in our community we be whole and i say to you we have to make our people whole again

 this church have stand for that why do you think you have 5 million member in this country because people know you be fill with the spirit of god to do the right thing in this life by they so i say to you we have to make a partnership all the government agency all the business folk but where there be no family where there be no order where there be no hope where we be reduce the size of our armed service because we have win the cold war who will be there to give structure discipline and love to these child you must do that and we must help you scripture say 's you be the salt of the earth and the light of the world that if your light shine before man they will give glow to the father in heaven that be what we must do

 that be what we must do how would we explain it to martin luther king if he show up today and say yes we win the cold war yes the big threat that all of we grow up under communism and nuclear war communism gone nuclear war recede yes we develop all these miraculous technology yes we all have get a vcr in our home it be interesting yes we get 50 channel on the cable yes without regard to race if you work hard and play by the rule you can get into a service academy or a good college you will do just great how would we explain to he all these kid getting kill and kill each other how would we justify the thing that we permit that no other country in the world would permit how could we explain that we give people the freedom to succeed and we create condition in which million abuse that freedom to destroy the thing that make life worth living and life itself we can not

 and so i say to you today my fellow americans you give i this job and we be make progress on the thing you hire i to do but unless we deal with the ravage of crime and drug and violence and unless we recognize that it be due to the breakdown of the family the community and the disappearance of job and unless we say some of this can not be do by government because we have to reach deep inside to the value the spirit the soul and the truth of human nature none of the other thing we seek to do will ever take we where we need to go

 so in this pulpit on this day let i ask all of you in your heart to say we will honor the life and the work of martin luther king we will honor the meaning of our church we will somehow by god 's grace we will turn this around we will give these child a future we will take away their gun and give they book we will take away their despair and give they hope we will rebuild the family and the neighborhood and the community we will not make all the work that have go on here benefit just a few we will do it together by the grace of god

 thank you

thank you very much i be delighted to see all of you here i thank speaker foley and the republican leader bob michel for join we today there be so many people to thank and the vice president do a marvelous job i do want to mention if i might just three other laura tyson the chair of the council of economic advisers bob rubin head of my national economic team and one republican member of the house that be not mention congressman david dreier who go with i on a rainy day to louisiana to campaign for nafta there be many other that i might mention but i thank all of you for what you have do
 i also can not help but note that in spite of all the rest of our effort there be that magic moment on larry king which make a lot of difference and i thank the vice president for that and for so much else in the campaign when we decide to come out for nafta he be a strong supporter of that position in our personal meeting long before we know whether we would even be here or not
 i also would be remiss if i do not personally thank both mickey kantor and mack mclarty for the work they do especially in the closing day with the mexican trade representative and the mexican government i would also like to web come here the representative from mexico and canada and tell they they be in fact welcome here they be our partner in the future that we be try to make together
 i want to say a special word of thank to the cabinet because we have try to do something that i have not always see in the past and we try to get all of our departments and all of our cabinet leader to work together on all the thing that we all care about and a lot of they therefore bad to take a lot of personal time and business time away from their very busy schedule to do this i thank the former leader of our government that be mention and our military i can not help but note since general powell be here that every senior military officer with whom i speak about nafta be perhaps they be as a group perhaps the most intensely supportive of any group i speak with and i think it be because they have in their bone the experience of the world of the last several decade and they know we could not afford to turn away from our leadership responsibility and our constructive involvement in the world and many of they of course still in uniform be not permit to say that in public and should not have be but i think i can say that today i be profoundly personally move by the remark that they make
 i do want to say also a special word of thank to all the citizen who help we the business leader the labor folk the environmental people who come out and work through this many of they at great criticism particularly in the environmental movement and some of the work people who help it and a group that be quite pivotal to our success that i want to acknowledge specifically be the small business people many of whom get themselves organize and come forward and try to help we they make a real difference
 and they have be mention but i could not let this moment go by without thank my good friend bill daley and congressman bill frenzel for their work in help to mobilize this effort congressman frenzel write i a great letter the other day and send i one of his famous doodle that he doodle around the nafta legislation which i be now having frame but they sort of represent the bipartisan spirit that encapture the congress encapture the country in the cause to change i hope that we can have more than that in the day and month and year ahead it be a very fine thing
 this whole issue turn out to be a defining moment for our nation i speak with one of the folk who be in the reception just a few moment ago who tell i that he be in china watch the vote on international television when it be take and be say you would have have to be there to understand how important this be to the rest of the world not because of the term of nafta which basically be a trade agreement between the united states mexico and canada but because it become a symbolic struggle for the spirit of our country and for how we would approach this very difficult and rapidly change world deal with our own considerable challenge here at home
 i believe we have make a decision now that will permit we to create an economic order in the world that will promote more growth more equality well preservation of the environment and a great possibility of world peace we be on the verge of a global economic expansion that be spark by the fact that the united states light this critical moment decide that we would compete not retreat
 in a few moment i will sign the north american free trade act into law nafta will tear clown trade barrier between our three nation it will create the world 's large trade zone and create 200,000 job in this country by 1995 alone the environmental and labor side agreement negotiate by our administration will make this agreement a force for social progress as well as economic growth already the confidence we have display by ratify nafta have begin to bear fruit we be now make real progress toward a worldwide trade agreement so significant that it could make the material gain of nafta for our country look small by comparison
 today we have the chance to do what our parent do before we we have the opportunity to remake the world for this new era our national security we now know will be determine as much by our ability to pull down foreign trade barrier as by our ability to breach distant rampart once again we be lead and in so do we be rediscover a fundamental truth about ourselves when we lead we build security we build prosperity for our own people
 we have learn this lesson the hard way twice before in this century we have be force to define our role in the world after world war i we turn inward build wall of protectionism around our nation the result be a great depression and ultimately another horrible world war after the second world war we take a different course we reach outward gifted leader of both political party build a new order base on collective security and expand trade they create a foundation of stability and create in the process the condition which lead to the explosion of the great american middle class one of the true economic miracle in the whole history of civilization their statecraft stand to this day the imf and the world bank gatt and nato
 in this very auditorium in 1949 president harry truman sign one of the charter document of this golden era of american leadership the north atlantic treaty that create nato in this pact we hope to create a shield against aggression and the fear of aggression tell his audience a bulwark which will permit we to get on with the real business of government and society the business of achieve a full and happy life for our citizen
 now the institution build by truman and acheson by marshall and vandenberg have accomplish their task the cold war be over the grim certitude of the contest with communism have be replace by the exuberant uncertainty of international economic competition and the great question of this day be how to ensure security for our people at a time when change be the only constant
 make no mistake the global economy with all of its promise and peril be now the central fact of life for hard work americans it have enrich the life of million of americans but for too many those same wind of change have wear away at file basis of their security for two decade most people have work hard for less seemingly secure job have be lose and while america once again be the most productive nation on earth this productivity itself hold the seed of further insecurity after all productivity mean the same people can produce more or very often that few people can produce more this be the world we face
 we can not stop global change we can not repeal the international economic competition that be everywhere we can only harness the energy to our benefit now we must recognize that the only way for a wealthy nation to grow rich be to export to simply find new customer for the product and service it make that my fellow americans be the decision the congress make when they vote to ratify nafta
 i be gratify with the work that congress have do this year bring the deficit down and keep interest rate down get housing start and new job go upward but we know that over the long rim our ability to have our internal economic policy work for the benefit of our people require we to have external economic policy that permit productivity to find expression not simply in high income for our business but in more job and high income for our people that mean more customer there be no other way not for the united states or for europe or for japan or for any other wealthy nation in the world
 that be why i be gratified that we have such a good meeting after the nafta vote in the house with the asian pacific leader in washington i be gratified that as vice president gore and chief of staff mack mclarty announce 2 week ago when they meet with president salinas next year the nation of this hemisphere will gather in an economic summit that will plan how to extend the benefit of trade to the emerge market democracy of all the americas
 and now i be pleased that we have the opportunity to secure the big breakthrough of all negotiator from 112 nation be seek to conclude negotiation on a new round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade a historic world de trade pact one that would spur a global economic boon be now within our grasp let i be clear we can not nor should we settle for a bad gatt agreement but we will not flag in our effort to secure a good one in these closing day we be prepared to make our contribution to the success of this negotiation but we insist that other nation do their part as well we must not squander this opportunity i call on all the nation of the world to seize this moment and close the deal on a strong gatt agreement within the next week
 i say to everyone even to our negotiator do not rest do not sleep close the deal i tell mickey kantor the other day that we reward his laborious effort on nafta with a vacation at the gatt talk laughter
 my fellow americans bit by bit all these thing be create the condition of a sustained global expansion as significant as they be our goal must be more ambitious the united states must seek nothing less than a new trading system that benefit all nation through robust commerce but that protect our middle class and give other nation a chance to grow one that lift worker and the environment up without drag people down that seek to ensure that our policy reflect our value
 our agenda must therefore be far reaching we be determine that dynamic trade can not lead to environmental despoliation we will seek new institutional arrangement to ensure that trade leave the world clean than before we will press for worker in all country to secure right that we now take for grant to organize and earn a decent living we will insist that expand trade be fair to our business and to our region no country should use cartel subsidy or rule of entry to keep our product off its shelf and we must see to it that our citizen have the personal security to confidently participate in this new era every worker must receive the education and training he or she need to reap the reward of international competition rather than to bear its burden
 next year our administration will propose comprehensive legislation to transform our unemployment system into a reemployment and job retrain system for the 21st century and above all i say to you we must seek to reconstruct the broad base political coalition for expand trade for decade work man and woman and their representative support policy that bring we prosperity and security that be because we recognize that expand trade benefit all of we but that we have an obligation to protect those worker who do bear the brunt of competition by give they a chance to be retrain and to go on to a new and different and ultimately more secure and more rewarding way of work in recent year this social contract have be sunder it can not continue
 when i affix my signature to the nafta legislation a few moment from now i do so with this pledge to the man and woman of our country who be afraid of these change and find in their opposition to nafta an expression of that fear what i think be a wrong expression and what i know be a wrong expression but nonetheless represent legitimate fear the gain from this agreement will be your gain too
 i ask those who oppose nafta to work with we to guarantee that the labor and side agreement be enforce and i call on all of we who believe in nafta to join with i to urge the congress to create the world 's good worker training and retrain system we owe it to the business community as well as to the work man and woman of this country it mean great productivity low unemployment great worker efficiency and high wage and great security for our people we have to do that
 we seek a new and more open global trading system not for its own sake but for our own sake good job rewarding career broaden horizon for the middle class americans can only be secure by expand export and global growth for too long our step have be unsteady as the ground have shift beneath our foot today as i sign the north american free trade agreement into law and call for further progress on gatt i believe we have find our footing and i ask all of you to be steady to recognize that there be no turning back from the world of today and tomorrow we must face the challenge embrace they with confidence deal with the problem honestly and openly and make this world work for all of we america be where it should be in the lead set the pace show the confidence that all of we need to face tomorrow we be ready to compete and we can win
 thank you very much

thank you very much mr. speaker mr. president member of the 103rd congress my fellow americans
 i be not at all sure what speech be in the teleprompter tonight laughter but i hope we can talk about the state of the union
 i ask you to begin by recall the memory of the giant who preside over this chamber with such force and grace tip o'neill like to call himself a man of the house and he surely be that but even more he be a man of the people a bricklayer 's son who help to build the great american middle class tip o'neill never forget who he be where he come from or who send he here tonight he be smile down on we for the first time from the lord 's gallery but in his honor may we too always remember who we be where we come from and who send we here if we do that we will return over and over again to the principle that if we simply give ordinary people equal opportunity quality education and a fair shot at the american dream they will do extraordinary thing
 we gather tonight in a world of change so profound and rapid that all nation be test our american heritage have always be to master such change to use it to expand opportunity at home and our leadership abroad but for too long and in too many way that heritage be abandon and our country drift
 for 30 year family life in america have be break down for 20 year the wage of work people have be stagnant or decline for the 12 year of trickle down economic we build a false prosperity on a hollow base as our national debt quadruple from 1989 to 1992 we experience the slow growth in a half century for too many family even when both parent be work the american dream have be slip away
 in 1992 the american people demand that we change a year ago i ask all of you to join i in accept responsibility for the future of our country well we do we replace drift and deadlock with renewal and reform and i want to thank every one of you here who hear the american people who break gridlock who give they the most successful teamwork between a president and a congress in 30 year
 this congress produce a budget that cut the deficit by half a trillion dollar cut spending and raise income taxis on only the wealthy americans this congress produce tax relief for million of low income worker to reward work over welfare it produce nafta it produce the brady bill now the brady law and thank you jim brady for be here and god bless you sir
 this congress produce tax cut to reduce the taxis of nine out of 10 small business who use the money to invest more and create more job it produce more research and treatment for aids more childhood immunization more support for woman 's health research more affordable college loan for the middle class a new national service program for those who want to give something back to their country and their community for high education a dramatic increase in high tech investment to move we from a defense to a domestic high tech economy this congress produce a new law the motor voter bill to help million of people register to vote it produce family and medical leave all pass all sign into law with not one single veto these accomplishment be all commitment i make when i seek this office and in fairness they all have to be pass by you in this congress but i be persuade that the real credit belong to the people who send we here who pay our salary who hold our foot to the fre
 but what we do here be really begin to change life let i just give you one example i will never forget what the family and medical leave law mean to just one father i meet early one sunday morning in the white house it be unusual to see a family there tour early sunday morning but he have his wife and his three child there one of they in a wheelchair i come up and after we have our picture take and have a little visit i be walk off and that man grab i by the arm and he say mr. president let i tell you something my little girl here be desperately ill she be probably not go to make it but because of the family leave law i be able to take time off to spend with she the most important time i ever spend in my life without lose my job and hurt the rest of my family it mean more to i than i will ever be able to say do not you people up here ever think what you do do not make a difference it do
 though we be make a difference our work have just begin many americans still have not feel the impact of what we have do the recovery still have not touch every community or create enough job income be still stagnant there be still too much violence and not enough hope in too many place abroad the young democracy we be strongly support still face very difficult time and look to we for leadership and so tonight let we resolve to continue the journey of renewal to create more and well job to guarantee health security for all to reward work over welfare to promote democracy abroad and to begin to reclaim our street from violent crime and drug and gang to renew our own american community
 last year we begin to put our house in order by tackle the budget deficit that be drive we toward bankruptcy we cut $ 255 billion in spending include entitlement and over 340 separate budget item we freeze domestic spending and use honest budget number
 lead by the vice president we launch a campaign to reinvent government we cut staff cut perk even trim the fleet of federal limousine after year of leader whose rhetoric attack bureaucracy but whose action expand it we will actually reduce it by 252,000 people over the next five year by the time we have finish the federal bureaucracy will be at its low point in 30 year
 because the deficit be so large and because they benefit from tax cut in the 1980 we do ask the wealthy americans to pay more to reduce the deficit so on april 15 the american people will discover the truth about what we do last year on taxis only the top 1—[applause]—ye listen the top 1.2 percent of americans as i say all along will pay high income tax rate let i repeat only the wealthy 1.2 percent of americans will face high income tax rate and no one else will and that be the truth
 of course there be as there always be in politic naysayer who say this plan would not work but they be wrong when i become president the expert predict that next year 's deficit would be $ 300 billion but because we act those same people now say the deficit be go to be under $ 180 billion 40 percent low than be previously predict
 our economic program have help to produce the low core inflation rate and the low interest rate in 20 year and because those interest rate be down business investment and equipment be grow at seven time the rate of the previous four year auto sale be way up home sale be at a record high million of americans have refinance their home and our economy have produce 1.6 million private sector job in 1993 more than be create in the previous four year combine
 the people who support this economic plan should be proud of its early result proud but everyone in this chamber should know and acknowledge that there be more to do
 next month i will send you one of the tough budget ever present to congress it will cut spending in more than 300 program eliminate 100 domestic program and reform the way in which government buy good and service this year we must again make the hard choice to live within the hard spending ceiling we have set we must do it we have prove we can bring the deficit down without choke off recovery without punish senior or the middle class and without put our national security at risk if you will stick with this plan we will post three consecutive year of decline deficit for the first time since harry truman live in the white house and once again the buck stop here
 our economic plan also bolster our strength and our credibility around the world once we reduce the deficit and put the steel back into our competitive edge the world echo with the sound of fall trade barrier in one year with nafta with gatt with our effort in asia and the national export strategy we do more to open world market to american product than at any time in the last two generation that mean more job and rise living standard for the american people low deficit low inflation low interest rate low trade barrier and high investment these be the building block of our recovery but if we want to take full advantage of the opportunity before we in the global economy you all know we must do more
 as we reduce defense spending i ask congress to invest more in the technology of tomorrow defense conversion will keep we strong militarily and create job for our people here at home as we protect our environment we must invest in the environmental technology of the future which will create job this year we will fight for a revitalize clean water act and a safe drinking water act and a reform superfund program and the vice president be right we must also work with the private sector to connect every classroom every clinic every library every hospital in america into a national information super highway by the year 2000
 think of it instant access to information will increase productivity will help to educate our child it will provide well medical care it will create job and i call on the congress to pass legislation to establish that information super highway this year
 as we expand opportunity and create job no one can be leave out we must continue to enforce fair lending and fair housing and all civil right law because america will never be complete in its renewal until everyone share in its bounty
 but we all know too we can do all these thing put our economic house in order expand world trade target the job of the future guarantee equal opportunity but if we be honest we will all admit that this strategy still can not work unless we also give our people the education training and skill they need to seize the opportunity of tomorrow
 we must set tough world class academic and occupational standard for all our child and give our teacher and student the tool they need to meet they our goal 2000 proposal will empower individual school district to experiment with idea like charter their school to be run by private corporation or have more public school choice to do whatever they wish to do as long as we measure every school by one high standard be our child learn what they need to know to compete and win in the global economy goal 2000 link world class standard to grassroots reform and i hope congress will pass it without delay
 our school to work initiative will for the first time link school to the world of work provide at least one year of apprenticeship beyond high school after all most of the people we be count on to build our economic future will not graduate from college it be time to stop ignore they and start empower they
 we must literally transform our outdated unemployment system into a new reemployment system the old unemployment system just sort of keep you go while you wait for your old job to come back we have get to have a new system to move people into new and well job because most of those old job just do not come back and we know that the only way to have real job security in the future to get a good job with a grow income be to have real skill and the ability to learn new one so we have get to streamline today 's patchwork of training program and make they a source of new skill for our people who lose their job reemployment not unemployment must become the centerpiece of our economic renewal i urge you to pass it in this session of congress
 and just as we must transform our unemployment system so must we also revolutionize our welfare system it do not work it defy our value as a nation if we value work we can not justify a system that make welfare more attractive than work if people be worried about lose their health care if we value responsibility we can not ignore the $ 34 billion in child support absent parent ought to be pay to million of parent who be take care of their child if we value strong family we can not perpetuate a system that actually penalize those who stay together can you believe that a child who have a child get more money from the government for leave home than for stay home with a parent or a grandparent that be not just bad policy it be wrong and we ought to change it
 i work on this problem for year before i become president with other governors and with member of congress of both party and with the previous administration of another party i work on it with people who be on welfare lot of they and i want to say something to everybody here who care about this issue the people who most want to change this system be the people who be dependent on it they want to get off welfare they want to go back to work they want to do right by their kid
 i once have a hearing when i be a governor and i bring in people on welfare from all over america who have find their way to work the woman from my state who testify be ask this question what be the good thing about be off welfare and in a job and without blink an eye she look at 40 governor and she say when my boy go to school and they say what do you mother do for a living he can give an answer these people want a well system and we ought to give it to they
 last year we begin this we give the state more power to innovate because we know that a lot of great idea come from outside washington and many state be already use it then this congress take a dramatic step instead of tax people with modest income into poverty we help they to work their way out of poverty by dramatically increase the earn income tax credit it will lift 15 million work family out of poverty rewarding work over welfare make it possible for people to be successful worker and successful parent now that be real welfare reform
 but there be more to be do this spring i will send you a comprehensive welfare reform bill that build on the family support act of 1988 and restore the basic value of work and responsibility we will say to teenager if you have a child out of wedlock we will no long give you a check to set up a separate household we want family to stay together say to absent parent who be not pay their child support if you be not provide for your child we will garnish your wage suspend your license track you across state line and if necessary make some of you work off what you owe people who bring child into this world can not and must not walk away from they but to all those who depend on welfare we should offer ultimately a simple compact we will provide the support the job training the child care you need for up to two year but after that anyone who can work must in the private sector wherever possible in community service if necessary that be the only way we will ever make elfare what it ought to be a second chance not a way of life
 i know it will be difficult to tackle welfare reform in 1994 at the same time we tackle health care but let i point out i think it be inevitable and imperative it be estimate that one million people be on welfare today because it be the only way they can get health care coverage for their child those who choose to leave welfare for job without health benefit and many entry level job do not have health benefit find themselves in the incredible position of pay taxis that help to pay for health care coverage for those who make the other choice to stay on welfare no wonder people leave work and go back to welfare to get health care coverage we have get to solve the health care problem to have real welfare reform
 so this year we will make history by reform the health care system and i would say to you all of you my fellow public servant this be another issue where the people be way ahead of the politician that may not be popular with either party but it happen to be the truth
 you know the first lady have receive now almost a million letter from people all across america and from all walk of life i would like to share just one of they with you richard anderson of reno nevada lose his job and with it his health insurance two week later his wife judy suffer a cerebral aneurysm he rush she to the hospital where she stay in intensive care for 21 day the andersons bill be over $ 120,000 although judy recover and richard go back to work at $ 8 an hour the bill be too much for they and they be literally force into bankruptcy mrs. clinton he write to hillary no one in the united states of america should have to lose everything they have work for all their life because they be unfortunate enough to become ill it be to help the richard and judy andersons of america that the first lady and so many other have work so hard and so long on this health care reform issue we owe they our thank and our action
 i know there be people here who say there be no health care crisis tell it to richard and judy anderson tell it to the 58 million americans who have no coverage at all for some time each year tell it to the 81 million americans with those preexist condition those folk be pay more or they can not get insurance at all or they can not ever change their job because they or someone in their family have one of those preexist condition tell it to the small business burden by the skyrocket cost of insurance most small business cover their employee and they pay on average 35 percent more in premium than big business or government or tell it to the 76 percent of insured americans three out of four whose policy have lifetime limit and that mean they can find themselves without any coverage at all just when they need it the most so if any of you believe there be no crisis you tell it to those people because i can not
 there be some people who literally do not understand the impact of this problem on people 's life and all you have to do be go out and listen to they just go talk to they anywhere in any congressional district in this country they be republicans and democrats and independent it do not have a lick to do with party they think we do not get it and it be time we show they that we do get it
 from the day we begin our health care initiative have be design to strengthen what be good about our health care system the world 's good health care professional cut edge research and wonderful research institution medicare for old americans none of this none of it should be put at risk
 but we be pay more and more money for less and less care every year few and few americans even get to choose their doctor every year doctor and nurse spend more time on paperwork and less time with patient because of the absolute bureaucratic nightmare the present system have become this system be riddle with inefficiency with abuse with fraud and everybody know it in today 's health care system insurance company call the shot they pick whom they cover and how they cover they they can cut off your benefit when you need your coverage the most they be in charge
 what do it mean it mean every night million of well insure americans go to bed just an illness an accident or a pink slip away from have no coverage or financial ruin it mean every morning million of americans go to work without any health insurance at all something the worker in no other advanced country in the world do it mean that every year more and more hard work people be tell to pick a new doctor because their boss have have to pick a new plan and countless other turn down well job because they know if they take the well job they will lose their health insurance if we just let the health care system continue to drift our country will have people with less care few choice and high bill
 now our approach protect the quality of care and people 's choice it build on what work today in the private sector to expand employer base coverage to guarantee private insurance for every american and i might say employer base private insurance for every american be propose 20 year ago by president richard nixon to the united states congress it be a good idea then and it be a well idea today
 why do we want guarantee private insurance because right now nine out of 10 people who have insurance get it through their employer and that should continue and if your employer be provide good benefit at reasonable price that should continue too that ought to make the congress and the president feel well
 our goal be health insurance everybody can depend on comprehensive benefit that cover preventive care and prescription drug health premium that do not just explode when you get sick or you get old the power no matter how small your business be to choose dependable insurance at the same competitive rate government and big business get today one simple form for people who be sick and most of all the freedom to choose a plan and the right to choose your own doctor
 our approach protect old american every plan before the congress propose to slow the growth of medicare the difference be this we believe those saving should be use to improve health care for senior citizen medicare must be protect and it should cover prescription drug and we should take the first step in cover long term care to those who would cut medicare without protect senior i say the solution to today 's squeeze on middle class work people 's health care be not to put the squeeze on middle class retire people 's health care we can do well than that
 when it be all say and do it be pretty simple to i insurance ought to mean what it use to mean you pay a fair price for security and when you get sick health care be always there no matter what
 along with the guarantee of health security we all have to admit too there must be more responsibility on the part of all of we in how we use this system people have to take their kid to get immunize we should all take advantage of preventive care we must all work together to stop the violence that explode our emergency room we have to practice well health habit and we can not abuse the system and those who do not have insurance under our approach will get coverage but they will have to pay something for it too the minority of business that provide no insurance at all and in so do shift the cost of the care of their employee to other should contribute something people who smoke should pay more for a pack of cigarette everybody can contribute something if we want to solve the health care crisis there can not be any more something for nothing it will not be easy but it can be do
 now in the come month i hope very much to work with both democrats and republicans to reform a health care system by use the market to bring down cost and to achieve last health security but if you look at history we see that for 60 year this country have try to reform health care president roosevelt try president truman try president nixon try president carter try every time the special interest be powerful enough to defeat they but not this time
 i know that face up to these interest will require courage it will raise critical question about the way we finance our campaign and how lobbyist yield their influence the work of change frankly will never get any easy until we limit the influence of well finance interest who profit from this current system so i also must now call on you to finish the job both houses begin last year by pass tough and meaningful campaign finance reform and lobby reform legislation this year
 you know my fellow americans this be really a test for all of we the american people provide those of we in government service with terrific health care benefit at reasonable cost we have health care that be always there i think we need to give every hard work tax pay american the same health care security they have already give to we
 i want to make this very clear i be open as i have say repeatedly to the good idea of concerned member of both party i have no special brief for any specific approach even in our own bill except this if you send i legislation that do not guarantee every american private health insurance that can never be take away you will force i to take this pen veto the legislation and we will come right back here and start all over again
 but i do not think that be go to happen i think we be ready to act now i believe that you be ready to act now and if you be ready to guarantee every american the same health care that you have health care that can never be take away now not next year or the year after now be the time to stand with the people who send we here now
 as we take these step together to renew our strength at home we can not turn away from our obligation to renew our leadership abroad this be a promising moment because of the agreement we have reach this year last year russia 's strategic nuclear missile soon will no long be point at the united states nor will we point ours at they instead of build weapon in space russian scientist will help we to build the international space station
 of course there be still danger in the world rampant arm proliferation bitter regional conflict ethnic and nationalist tension in many new democracy severe environmental degradation the world over and fanatic who seek to cripple the world 's city with terror as the world 's great power we must therefore maintain our defense and our responsibility
 this year we secure indictment against terrorist and sanction against those who harbor they we work to promote environmentally sustainable economic growth we achieve agreement with ukraine with belarus with kazahkstan to eliminate completely their nuclear arsenal we be work to achieve a korean peninsula free of nuclear weapon we will seek early ratification of a treaty to ban chemical weapon worldwide and early today we join with over 30 nation to begin negotiation on a comprehensive ban to stop all nuclear testing
 but nothing nothing be more important to our security than our nation 's armed force we honor their contribution include those who be carry out the long humanitarian air lift in history in bosnia those who will complete their mission in somalia this year and their brave comrade who give their life there our force be the fine military our nation have ever have and i have pledge that as long as i be president they will remain the well equip the well train and the well prepare fighting force on the face of the earth
 last year i propose a defense plan that maintain our post cold war security at a low cost this year many people urge i to cut our defense spending far to pay for other government program i say no the budget i send to congress draw the line against further defense cut it protect the readiness and quality of our force ultimately the good strategy be to do that we must not cut defense far i hope the congress without regard to party will support that position
 ultimately the good strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace be to support the advance of democracy elsewhere democracy do not attack each other they make well trading partner and partner in diplomacy that be why we have support you and i the democratic reformer in russia and in the other state of the former soviet bloc i applaud the bipartisan support this congress provide last year for our initiative to help russia ukraine and the other state through their epic transformation
 our support of reform must combine patience for the enormity of the task and vigilance for our fundamental interest and value we will continue to urge russia and the other state to press ahead with economic reform and we will seek to cooperate with russia to solve regional problem while insist that if russian troop operate in neighboring state they do so only when those state agree to their presence and in strict accord with international standard
 but we must also remember as these nation chart their own future and they must chart their own future how much more secure and more prosperous our own people will be if democratic and market reform succeed all across the former communist bloc our policy have be to support that move and that have be the policy of the congress we should continue it
 that be why i go to europe early this month to work with our european partner to help to integrate all the former communist country into a europe that have a possibility of become unify for the first time in its entire history its entire history base on the simple commitment of all nation in europe to democracy to free market and to respect for exist border
 with our ally we have create a partnership for peace that invite state from the former soviet bloc and other non nato member to work with nato in military cooperation when i meet with central europe 's leader include lech walesa and vaclav havel man who put their life on the line for freedom i tell they that the security of their region be important to our country 's security
 this year we must also do more to support democratic renewal and human right and sustainable development all around the world we will ask congress to ratify the new gatt accord we will continue stand by south africa as it work its way through its bold and hopeful and difficult transition to democracy we will convene a summit of the western hemisphere 's democratic leader from canada to the tip of south america and we will continue to press for the restoration of true democracy in haiti and as we build a more constructive relationship with china we must continue to insist on clear sign of improvement in that nation 's human right record
 we will also work for new progress toward the middle east peace last year the world watch yitzhak rabin and yasser arafat at the white house when they have their historic handshake of reconciliation but there be a long hard road ahead and on that road i be determined that i and our administration will do all we can to achieve a comprehensive and lasting peace for all the people of the region
 now there be some in our country who argue that with the cold war america should turn its back on the rest of the world many around the world be afraid we would do just that but i take this office on a pledge that have no partisan tinge to keep our nation secure by remain engage in the rest of the world and this year because of our work together enact nafta keep our military strong and prepare support democracy abroad we have reaffirm america 's leadership america 's engagement and as a result the american people be more secure than they be before
 but while americans be more secure from threat abroad i think we all know that in many way we be less secure from threat here at home every day the national peace be shatter by crime in petaluma california an innocent slumber party give way to agonize tragedy for the family of polly klaas an ordinary train ride on long island end in a hail of 9 millimeter round a tourist in florida be nearly burn alive by bigot simply because he be black right here in our nation 's capital a brave young man name jason white a policeman the son and grandson of policeman be ruthlessly gun down violent crime and the fear it provoke be cripple our society limit personal freedom and fray the tie that bind we
 the crime bill before congress give you a chance to do something about it a chance to be tough and smart what do that mean let i begin by say i care a lot about this issue many year ago when i start out in public life i be the attorney general of my state i serve as a governor for a dozen year i know what it be like to sign law increase penalty to build more prison cell to carry out the death penalty i understand this issue and it be not a simple thing
 first we must recognize that most violent crime be commit by a small percentage of criminal who too often break the law even when they be on parole now those who commit crime should be punish and those who commit repeat violent crime should be tell when you commit a third violent crime you will be put away and put away for good three strike and you be out
 second we must take serious step to reduce violence and prevent crime begin with more police officer and more community police we know right now that police who work the street know the folk have the respect of the neighborhood kid focus on high crime area we know that they be more likely to prevent crime as well as catch criminal look at the experience of houston where the crime rate drop 17 percent in one year when that approach be take
 here tonight be one of those community policeman a brave young detective kevin jett whose beat be eight square block in one of the tough neighborhood in new york every day he restore some sanity and safety and a sense of value and connection to the people whose life he protect i would like to ask he to stand up and be recognize tonight thank you sir applause
 you will be give a chance to give the child of this country the law abide work people of this country and do not forget in the tough neighborhood in this country in the high crime neighborhood in this country the vast majority of people get up every day and obey the law pay their taxis do their good to raise their kid they deserve people like kevin jett and you be go to be give a chance to give the american people another 100,000 of they well train and i urge you to do it
 you have before you crime legislation which also establish a police corp to encourage young people to get an education and pay it off by serve as police officer which encourage retire military personnel to move into police force an inordinate resource for our country one which have a safe school provision which will give our young people the chance to walk to school in safety and to be in school in safety instead of dodge bullet these be important thing
 the third thing we have to do be to build on the brady bill the brady law to take further step to keep gun out of the hand of criminal i want to say something about this issue hunter must always be free to hunt law abide adult should always be free to own gun and protect their home i respect that part of our culture i grow up in it but i want to ask the sportsman and other who lawfully own gun to join we in this campaign to reduce gun violence i say to you i know you do not create this problem but we need your help to solve it there be no sporting purpose on earth that should stop the united states congress from banish assault weapon that out gun police and cut down child
 fourth we must remember that drug be a factor in an enormous percentage of crime recent study indicate sadly that drug use be on the rise again among our young people the crime bill contain all the crime bill contain more money for drug treatment for criminal addict and boot camp for youthful offender that include incentive to get off drug and to stay off drug our administration 's budget with all its cut contain a large increase in funding for drug treatment and drug education you must pass they both we need they desperately
 my fellow americans the problem of violence be an american problem it have no partisan or philosophical element therefore i urge you to find way as quickly as possible to set aside partisan difference and pass a strong smart tough crime bill but far i urge you to consider this as you demand tough penalty for those who choose violence let we also remember how we come to this sad point in our tough neighborhood on our mean street in our poor rural area we have see a stunning and simultaneous breakdown of community family and work the heart and soul of civilized society this have create a vast vacuum which have be fill by violence and drug and gang so i ask you to remember that even as we say no to crime we must give people especially our young people something to say yes to
 many of our initiative from job training to welfare reform to health care to national service will help to rebuild distressed community to strengthen family to provide work but more need to be do that be what our community empowerment agenda be all about challenge business to provide more investment through empowerment zone ensure bank will make loan in the same community their deposit come from pass legislation to unleash the power of capital through community development bank to create job opportunity and hope where they be need most
 i think you know that to really solve this problem we will all have to put our head together leave our ideological armor aside and find some new idea to do even more and let us be honest we all know something else too our problem go way beyond the reach of government they be root in the loss of value in the disappearance of work and the breakdown of our family and our community
 my fellow americans we can cut the deficit create job promote democracy around the world pass welfare reform and health care pass the tough crime bill in history but still leave too many of our people behind the american people have get to want to change from within if we be go to bring back work and family and community we can not renew our country when within a decade more than half of the child will be bear into family where there have be no marriage we can not renew this country when 13 year old boy get semi automatic weapon to shoot 9 year old for kick we can not renew our country when child be have child and the father walk away as if the kid do not amount to anything we can not renew the country when our business eagerly look for new investment and new customer abroad but ignore those people right here at home who would give anything to have their job and would gladly buy their product if they have the money to do it we can not renew our country unless more of we i mean all of we be willing to join the church and the other good citizen people like all the minister i have work with over the year or the priest and the nun i meet at our lady of help in east los angeles or my good friend tony campollo in philadelphia unless we be willing to work with people like that people who be save kid adopt school make street safe all of we can do that we can not renew our country until we realize that government do not raise child parent do
 parent who know their child 's teacher and turn off the television and help with the homework and teach their kid right from wrong those kind of parent can make all the difference i know i have one i be tell you we have get to stop point our finger at these kid who have no future and reach our hand out to they our country need it we need it and they deserve it
 so i say to you tonight let us give our child a future let we take away their gun and give they book let we overcome their despair and replace it with hope let we by our example teach they to obey the law respect our neighbor and cherish our value let we weave these sturdy thread into a new american community that can once more stand strong against the force of despair and evil because everybody have a chance to walk into a well tomorrow
 oh there will be naysayer who fear that we will not be equal to the challenge of this time but they misread our history our heritage even today 's headline all those thing tell we we can and we will overcome any challenge
 when the earth shake and fire rage in california when i see the mississippi deluge the farmland of the midwest in a 500 year flood when the century 's bitter cold sweep from north dakota to newport news it seem as though the world itself be come apart at the seam but the american people they just come together they rise to the occasion neighbor help neighbor stranger risk life and limb to save total stranger show the well angel of our nature
 let we not reserve the well angel only for natural disaster leave our deep and most profound problem to petty political fighting let we instead be true to our spirit face fact come together bring hope and move forward
 tonight my fellow americans we be summon to answer a question as old as the republic itself what be the state of our union it be grow strong but it must be strong still with your help and god 's help it will be
 thank you and god bless america

mr. dawson you do your man proud today general shalikashvili mr. cronkite chaplain distinguished leader of our government members of congress member of the armed service our host from france and most of all our veteran their family and their friend
 in these last day of ceremony we have hear wonderful word of tribute now we come to this hallowed place that speak more than anything else in silence here on this quiet plateau on this small piece of american soil we honor those who give their life for we 50 crowded year ago
 today the beach of normandy be calm if you walk these shore on a summer 's day all you might hear be the laughter of child play on the sand or the cry of seagull overhead or perhaps the ringing of a distant church bell the simple sound of freedom barely break the silence peaceful silence ordinary silence
 but june 6th 1944 be the least ordinary day of the 20th century on that chill dawn these beach echo with the sound of staccato gunfire the roar of aircraft the thunder of bombardment and through the wind and the wave come the soldier out of their landing craft and into the water away from their youth and toward a savage place many of they would sadly never leave they have come to free a continent the americans the british the canadians the poles the french resistance the norwegians and other they have all come to stop one of the great force of evil the world have ever know
 as news of the invasion break back home in america people hold their breath in boston commuter stand read the news on the electric sign at south station in new york the statue of liberty its torch black out since pearl harbor be light at sunset for 15 minute and in newcastle pennsylvania a young mother name pauline elliot write to her husband frank a corporal in the army d day have arrive the first thought of all of we be a prayer
 below we be the beach where corporal elliot 's battalion and so many other americans land omaha and utah proud name from america 's heartland part of the big gamble of the war the great crusade yes the long day
 during those first hour on bloody omaha nothing seem to go right landing craft be rip apart by mine and shell tank send to protect they have sink drown their crew enemy fire rake the invader as they step into chest high water and wade past the float body of their comrade and as the stunned survivor of the first wave huddle behind a seawall it seem the invasion might fail
 hitler and his follower have bet on it they be sure the allied soldier be soft weaken by liberty and leisure by the mingling of race and religion they be sure their totalitarian youth have more discipline and zeal
 but then something happen although many of the american troop find themselves without officer on unfamiliar ground next to soldier they do not know one by one they get up they inch forward and together in group of three and five and ten the son of democracy improvise and mount their own attack at that exact moment on these beach the force of freedom turn the tide of the 20th century
 these soldier know that staying put mean certain death but they be also drive by the voice of free will and responsibility nurture in sunday school town hall and sandlot ballgame the voice that tell they to stand up and move forward say you can do it and if you do not no one else will and as captain joe dawson lead his company up this bluff and as other follow his lead they secure a foothold for freedom
 today many of they be here among we oh they may walk with a little less spring in their step and their rank be grow thin but let we never forget when they be young these man save the world and so let we now ask they all the veteran of the normandy campaign to stand if they can and be recognize applause
 the freedom they fight for be no abstract concept it be the stuff of their daily life listen to what frank elliot have write to his wife from the embarkation point in england i miss hamburger la coney island american beer la duquesne american show la penn theater and american girl la you pauline elliot write back on june 6th as she and their one year old daughter listen on the radio little deronda be the only one not affect by d day news i hope and pray she will never remember any of this but only the happiness of the hour that will follow her daddy 's homecoming step on the porch
 well million of our gi 's do return home from that war to build up our nation and enjoy life 's sweet pleasure but on this field there be 9,386 who do not 33 pair of brother a father and his son 11 man from tiny bedford virginia and corporal frank elliot kill near these bluff by a german shell on d day they be the father we never know the uncle we never meet the friend who never return the hero we can never repay they give we our world and those simple sound of freedom we hear today be their voice speak to we across the year
 at this place let we honor all the americans who lose their life in world war ii let we remember as well that over 40 million human being from every side perish soldier on the field of battle jews in the ghetto and death camp civilian ravage by shell fire and famine may god give rest to all their soul
 fifty year later what a different world we live in germany japan and italy liberate by our victory now stand among our close ally and the staunch defender of freedom russia decimate during the war and freeze afterward in communism and cold war have be reborn in democracy and as freedom ring from prague to kiev the liberation of this continent be nearly complete
 now the question fall to our generation how will we build upon the sacrifice of d day 's hero like the soldier of omaha beach we can not stand still we can not stay safe by do so avoid today 's problem would be our own generation 's appeasement for just as freedom have a price it also have a purpose and its name be progress today our mission be to expand freedom 's reach forward to test the full potential of each of our own citizen to strengthen our family our faith and our community to fight indifference and intolerance to keep our nation strong and to light the life of those still dwell in the darkness of undemocratic rule our parent do that and more we must do nothing less they struggle in war so that we might strive in peace
 we know that progress be not inevitable but neither be victory upon these beach now as then the inner voice tell we to stand up and move forward now as then free people must choose
 fifty year ago the first allied soldier to land here in normandy come not from the sea but from the sky they be call pathfinders the first paratrooper to make the jump deep in the darkness they descend upon these field to light beacon for the airborne assault that would soon follow now near the dawn of a new century the job of light those beacon fall to our hand
 to you who bring we here i promise we will be the new pathfinder for we be the child of your sacrifice
 thank you and god bless you all

mr. president mr. speaker member of the 104th congress my fellow americans again we be here in the sanctuary of democracy and once again our democracy have speak so let i begin by congratulate all of you here in the 104th congress and congratulate you mr. speaker

 if we agree on nothing else tonight we must agree that the american people certainly vote for change in 1992 and in 1994 and as i look out at you i know how some of you must have feel in 1992

 i must say that in both year we do not hear america singing we hear america shout and now all of we republicans and democrats alike must say we hear you we will work together to earn the job you have give we for we be the keeper of a sacred trust and we must be faithful to it in this new and very demanding era

 over 200 year ago our founder change the entire course of human history by join together to create a new country base on a single powerful idea we hold these truth to be self evident that all man be create equal endow by their creator with certain unalienable right and among these be life liberty and the pursuit of happiness

 it have fall to every generation since then to preserve that idea the american idea and to deepen and expand its meaning in new and different time to lincoln and to his congress to preserve the union and to end slavery to theodore roosevelt and woodrow wilson to restrain the abuse and excess of the industrial revolution and to assert our leadership in the world to franklin roosevelt to fight the failure and pain of the great depression and to win our country 's great struggle against fascism and to all our president since to fight the cold war especially i recall two who struggle to fight that cold war in partnership with congresses where the majority be of a different party to harry truman who summon we to unparalleled prosperity at home and who build the architecture of the cold war and to ronald reagan whom we wish well tonight and who exhort we to carry on until the twilight struggle against communism be win

 in another time of change and challenge i have the honor to be the first president to be elect in the post cold war era an era mark by the global economy the information revolution unparalleled change and opportunity and insecurity for the american people i come to this hallowed chamber two year ago on a mission to restore the american dream for all our people and to make sure that we move into the 21st century still the strong force for freedom and democracy in the entire world i be determine then to tackle the tough problem too long ignore in this effort i be frank to say that i have make my mistake and i have learn again the importance of humility in all human endeavor but i be also proud to say tonight that our country be strong than it be two year ago applause thank you

 record number of americans be succeed in the new global economy we be at peace and we be a force for peace and freedom throughout the world we have almost six million new job since i become president and we have the low combine rate of unemployment and inflation in 25 year our business be more productive and here we have work to bring the deficit down to expand trade to put more police on our street to give our citizen more of the tool they need to get an education and to rebuild their own community

 but the rise tide be not lift all boat while our nation be enjoy peace and prosperity too many of our people be still work hard and hard for less and less while our business be restructure and grow more productive and competitive too many of our people still can not be sure of have a job next year or even next month and far more than our material rich be threaten thing far more precious to we our child our family our value

 our civil life be suffer in america today citizen be work together less and shout at each other more the common bond of community which have be the great strength of our country from its very beginning be badly fray what be we to do about it

 more than 60 year ago at the dawn of another new era president roosevelt tell our nation new condition impose new requirement on government and those who conduct government and from that simple proposition he shape the new deal which help to restore our nation to prosperity and define the relationship between our people and their government for half a century

 that approach work in its time but we today we face a very different time and very different condition we be move from an industrial age build on gear and sweat to an information age demand skill and learning and flexibility our government once a champion of national purpose be now see by many as simply a captive of narrow interest put more burden on our citizen rather than equip they to get ahead the value that use to hold we all together seem to be come apart

 so tonight we must forge a new social compact to meet the challenge of this time as we enter a new era we need a new set of understanding not just with government but even more important with one another as americans

 that be what i want to talk with you about tonight i call it the new covenant but it be ground in a very very old idea that all americans have not just a right but a solemn responsibility to rise as far as their god give talent and determination can take they and to give something back to their community and their country in return opportunity and responsibility they go hand in hand we can not have one without the other and our national community can not hold together without both

 our new covenant be a new set of understanding for how we can equip our people to meet the challenge of a new economy how we can change the way our government work to fit a different time and above all how we can repair the damage bond in our society and come together behind our common purpose we must have dramatic change in our economy our government and ourselves

 my fellow americans without regard to party let we rise to the occasion let we put aside partisanship and pettiness and pride as we embark on this new course let we put our country first remember that regardless of party label we be all americans and let the final test of everything we do be a simple one be it good for the american people

 let i begin by say that we can not ask americans to be well citizen if we be not well servant you make a good start by pass that law which apply to congress all the law you put on the private sector and i be proud to sign it yesterday but we have a lot more to do before people really trust the way thing work around here three time as many lobbyist be in the street and corridor of washington as be here 20 year ago the american people look at their capital and they see a city where the well connect and the well protect can work the system but the interest of ordinary citizen be often leave out

 as the new congress open its door lobbyist be still do business as usual the gift the trip all the thing that people be concern about have not stop twice this month you miss opportunity to stop these practice i know there be other consideration in those vote but i want to use something that i have hear my republican friend say from time to time there do not have to be a law for everything so tonight i ask you to just stop take the lobbyist perk just stop we do not have to wait for legislation to pass to send a strong signal to the american people that thing be really change but i also hope you will send i the strong possible lobby reform bill and i will sign that too

 we should require lobbyist to tell the people for whom they work what they be spend what they want we should also curb the role of big money in election by cap the cost of campaign and limit the influence of pac and as i have say for three year we should work to open the airwave so that they can be an instrument of democracy not a weapon of destruction by give free tv time to candidate for public office

 when the last congress kill political reform last year it be report in the press that the lobbyist actually stand in the hall of this sacred building and cheer this year let us give the folk at home something to cheer about

 more important i think we all agree that we have to change the way the government work let us make it small less costly and smart lean not mean applause

 i just tell the speaker the equal time doctrine be alive and well laughter

 the new covenant approach to governing be as different from the old bureaucratic way as the computer be from the manual typewriter the old way of govern around here protect organized interest we should look out for the interest of ordinary people the old way divide we by interest constituency or class the new covenant way should unite we behind a common vision of what be good for our country the old way dispense service through large top down inflexible bureaucracy the new covenant way should shift these resource and decisionmake from bureaucrat to citizen inject choice and competition and individual responsibility into national policy the old way of govern around here actually seem to reward failure the new covenant way should have build in incentive to reward success the old way be centralize here in washington the new covenant way must take hold in the community all across america and we should help they to do that

 our job here be to expand opportunity not bureaucracy to empower people to make the most of their own life and to enhance our security here at home and abroad we must not ask government to do what we should do for ourselves we should rely on government as a partner to help we to do more for ourselves and for each other

 i hope very much that as we debate these specific and exciting matter we can go beyond the sterile discussion between the illusion that there be somehow a program for every problem on the one hand and the other illusion that the government be a source of every problem we have our job be to get rid of yesterday 's government so that our own people can meet today 's and tomorrow 's need and we ought to do it together

 you know for year before i become president i hear other say they would cut government and how bad it be but not much happen we actually do it we cut over a quarter of a trillion dollar in spending more than 300 domestic program more than 100,000 position from the federal bureaucracy in the last two year alone base on decision already make we will have cut a total of more than a quarter of a million position from the federal government make it the small it have be since john kennedy be president by the time i come here again next year

 under the leadership of vice president gore our initiative have already save taxpayer $ 63 billion the age of the $ 500 hammer and the ashtray you can break on david letterman be go deadwood program like mohair subsidy be go we have streamline the agriculture department by reduce it by more than 1,200 office we have slash the small business loan form from an inch thick to a single page we have throw away the government 's 10,000 page personnel manual

 and the government be work well in important way fema the federal emergency management agency have go from be a disaster to help people in disaster you can ask the farmer in the middle west who fight the flood there or the people in california who have deal with flood and earthquake and fire and they will tell you that government worker work hand in hand with private business rebuild southern california 's fractured freeway in record time and under budget and because the federal government move fast all but one of the 5,600 school damage in the earthquake be back in business

 now there be a lot of other thing that i could talk about i want to just mention one because it will be discuss here in the next few week university administrator all over the country have tell i that they be save week and week of bureaucratic time now because of our direct college loan program which make college loan cheap and more affordable with well repayment term for student cost the government less and cut out paperwork and bureaucracy for the government and for the university we should not cap that program we should give every college in america the opportunity to be a part of it

 previous government program gather dust the reinventing government report be get result and we be not through there be go to be a second round of reinventing government we propose to cut $ 130 billion in spending by shrink department extend our freeze on domestic spending cut 60 public housing program down to three getting rid of over 100 program we do not need like the interstate commerce commission and the helium reserve program and we be work on getting rid of unnecessary regulation and make they more sensible the program and regulation that have outlive their usefulness should go we have to cut yesterday 's government to help solve tomorrow 's problem

 and we need to get government close to the people it be mean to serve we need to help move program down to the point where state and community and private citizen in the private sector can do a well job if they can do it we ought to let they do it we should get out of the way and let they do what they can do well take power away from federal bureaucracy and give it back to community and individual be something everyone should be able to be for

 it be time for congress to stop pass on to the state the cost of decision we make here in washington i know there be still serious difference over the detail of the unfunded mandate legislation but i want to work with you to make sure we pass a reasonable bill which will protect the national interest and give justify relief where we need to give it

 for year congress conceal in the budget score of pet spending project last year be no difference there be a $ 1 million to study stress in plant and $ 12 million for a tick removal program that do not work it be hard to remove tick those of we who have have they know laughter but i will tell you something if you will give i line item veto i will remove some of that unnecessary spending

 but i think we should all remember and almost all of we would agree that government still have important responsibility our young people we should think of this when we cut our young people hold our future in their hand we still owe a debt to our veteran and our senior citizen have make we what we be now my budget cut a lot but it protect education veteran social security and medicare and i hope you will do the same thing you should and i hope you will

 and when we give more flexibility to the state let we remember that there be certain fundamental national need that should be address in every state north and south east and west immunization against childhood disease school lunch in all our school head start medical care and nutrition for pregnant woman and infants—[applause]—medical care and nutrition for pregnant woman and infant all these thing all these thing be in the national interest

 i applaud your desire to get rid of costly and unnecessary regulation but when we deregulate let us remember what national action in the national interest have give we safe food for our family safe toy for our child safe nursing home for our parent safe car and highway and safe workplace clean air and clean water do we need common sense and fairness in our regulation you bet we do but we can have common sense and still provide for safe drinking water we can have fairness and still clean up toxic dump and we ought to do it

 should we cut the deficit more well of course we should of course we should but we can bring it down in a way that still protect our economic recovery and do not unduly punish people who should not be punish but instead should be help

 i know many of you in this chamber support the balanced budget amendment i certainly want to balance the budget our administration have do more to bring the budget down and to save money than any in a very very long time if you believe pass this amendment be the right thing to do then you have to be straight with the american people they have a right to know what you be go to cut what taxis you be go to raise and how it be go to affect they we should be do thing in the open around here for example everybody ought to know if this proposal be go to endanger social security i would oppose that and i think most americans would

 nothing have do more to undermine our sense of common responsibility than our fail welfare system this be one of the problem we have to face here in washington in our new covenant it reward welfare over work it undermine family value it let million of parent get away without pay their child support it keep a minority but a significant minority of the people on welfare trap on it for a very long time

 i have work on this problem for a long time nearly 15 year now as a governor i have the honor of work with the reagan administration to write the last welfare reform bill back in 1988 in the last two year we make a good start at continue the work of welfare reform our administration give two dozen state the right to slash through federal rule and regulation to reform their own welfare system and to try to promote work and responsibility over welfare and dependency

 last year i introduce the most sweeping welfare reform plan ever present by an administration we have to make welfare what it be mean to be a second chance not a way of life we have to help those on welfare move to work as quickly as possible to provide child care and teach they skill if that be what they need for up to two year and after that there ought to be a simple hard rule anyone who can work must go to work if a parent be not pay child support they should be force to pay we should suspend driver license track they across state line make they work off what they owe that be what we should do government do not raise child people do and the parent must take responsibility for the child they bring into this world

 i want to work with you with all of you to pass welfare reform but our goal must be to liberate people and lift they up from dependence to independence from welfare to work from mere childbearing to responsible parenting our goal should not be to punish they because they happen to be poor

 we should we should require work and mutual responsibility but we should not cut people off just because they be poor they be young or even because they be unmarried we should promote responsibility by require young mother to live at home with their parent or in other supervised setting by require they to finish school but we should not put they and their child out on the street and i know all the argument pro and con and i have read and think about this for a long time i still do not think we can in good conscience punish poor child for the mistake of their parent

 my fellow americans every single survey show that all the american people care about this without regard to party or race or region so let this be the year we end welfare as we know it but also let this be the year that we be all able to stop use this issue to divide america no one be more eager to end welfare—[applause]—i may be the only president who have actually have the opportunity to sit in a welfare office who be actually spend hour and hour talk to people on welfare and i be tell you the people who be trap on it know it do not work they also want to get off so we can promote together education and work and good parenting i have no problem with punish bad behavior or the refusal to be a worker or a student or a responsible parent i just do not want to punish poverty and past mistake all of we have make our mistake and none of we can change our yesterday but every one of we can change our tomorrow and america 's good example of that may be lynn woolsey who work her way off welfare to become a congresswoman from the state of california

 i know the member of this congress be concerned about crime as be all the citizen of our country and i remind you that last year we pass a very tough crime bill long sentence three strike and you be out almost 60 new capital punishment offense more prison more prevention 100,000 more police and we pay for it all by reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy and give the money back to local community to lower the crime rate

 there may be other thing we can do to be tough on crime to be smart with crime to help to lower that rate first well if there be let us talk about they and let us do they but let us not go back on the thing that we do last year that we know work that we know work because the local law enforcement officer tell we that we do the right thing because local community leader who have work for year and year to lower the crime rate tell we that they work let us look at the experience of our city and our rural area where the crime rate have go down and ask the people who do it how they do it and if what we do last year support the decline in the crime rate and i be convinced that it do let we not go back on it let us stick with it implement it we have get four more hard year of work to do to do that

 i do not want to destroy the good atmosphere in the room or in the country tonight but i have to mention one issue that divide this body greatly last year the last congress also pass the brady bill and in the crime bill the ban on 19 assault weapon i do not think it be a secret to anybody in this room that several member of the last congress who vote for that be not here tonight because they vote for it and i know therefore that some of you who be here because they vote for it be under enormous pressure to repeal it i just have to tell you how i feel about it

 the member of congress who vote for that bill and i would never do anything to infringe on the right to keep and bear arm to hunt and to engage in other appropriate sporting activity i have do it since i be a boy and i be go to keep right on do it until i can not do it anymore but a lot of people lay down their seat in congress so that police officer and kid would not have to lay down their life under a hail of assault weapon attack and i will not let that be repeal i will not let it be repeal

 i would like to talk about a couple of other issue we have to deal with i want we to cut more spending but i hope we will not cut government program that help to prepare we for the new economy promote responsibility and be organize from the grassroot up not by gederal bureaucracy the very good example of this be the national service corps americorps it pass with strong bipartisan support and now there be 20,000 americans more than ever serve in one year in the peace corps work all over this country help people person to person in local grassroots volunteer group solve problem and in the process earn some money for their education this be citizenship at its good it be good for the americorps member but it be good for the rest of we too it be the essence of the new covenant and we should not stop it

 all americans not only in the state most heavily affected but in every place in this country be rightly disturb by the large number of illegal alien enter our country the job they hold might otherwise be hold by citizen or legal immigrant the public service they use impose burden on our taxpayer that be why our administration have move aggressively to secure our border more by hire a record number of new border guard by deport twice as many criminal alien as ever before by crack down on illegal hiring by bar welfare benefit to illegal alien in the budget i will present to you we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal alien who be arrest for crime to well identify illegal alien in the workplace as recommend by the commission head by former congresswoman barbara jordan we be a nation of immigrant but we be also a nation of law it be wrong and ultimately self defeat for a nation of immigrant to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration law we have see in recent year and we must do more to stop it

 the most important job of our government in this new era be to empower the american people to succeed in the global economy america have always be a land of opportunity a land where if you work hard you can get ahead we have become a great middle class country middle class value sustain we we must expand that middle class and shrink the underclass even as we do everything we can to support the million of americans who be already successful in the new economy

 america be once again the world 's strong economic power almost six million new job in the last two year export boom inflation down high wage job be come back a record number of american entrepreneur be live the american dream if we want it to stay that way those who work and lift our nation must have more of its benefit

 today too many of those people be be leave out they be work hard for less they have less security less income less certainty that they can even afford a vacation much less college for their kid or retirement for themselves we can not let this continue if we do not act our economy will probably keep do what it be be do since about 1978 when the income growth begin to go to those at the very top of our economic scale and the people in the vast middle get very little growth and people who work like crazy but be on the bottom then fall even far and far behind in the year afterward no matter how hard they work

 we have get to have a government that can be a real partner in make this new economy work for all of our people a government that help each and every one of we to get an education and to have the opportunity to renew our skill that be why we work so hard to increase educational opportunity in the last two year from head start to public school to apprenticeship for young people who do not go to college to make college loan more available and more affordable that be the first thing we have to do we have get to do something to empower people to improve their skill

 the second thing we ought to do be to help people raise their income immediately by lower their taxis we take the first step in 1993 with a work family tax cut for 15 million family with income under $ 27,000 a tax cut that this year will average about $ 1,000 a family and we also give tax reduction to most small and new business before we could do more than that we first have to bring down the deficit we inherit and we have to get economic growth up now we have do both and now we can cut taxis in a more comprehensive way but tax cut should reinforce and promote our first obligation to empower our citizen through education and training to make the most of their own life the spotlight should shine on those who make the right choice for themselves their family and their community

 i have propose the middle class bill of right which should properly be call the bill of right and responsibility because its provision only benefit those who be work to educate and raise their child and to educate themselves it will therefore give need tax relief and raise income in both the short run and the long run in a way that benefit all of we

 there be four provision first a tax deduction for all education and training after high school if you think about it we permit business to deduct their investment we permit individual to deduct interest on their home mortgage but today an education be even more important to the economic well being of our whole country than even those thing be we should do everything we can to encourage it and i hope you will support it second we ought to cut taxis $ 500 for family with child under 13 third we ought to foster more saving and personal responsibility by permit people to establish an individual retirement account and withdraw from it tax free for the cost of education health care first time homebuying or the care of a parent and fourth we should pass a gi bill for america 's worker we propose to collapse nearly 70 federal program and not give the money to the state but give the money directly to the american people offer voucher to they so that they if they be lay off or if they be work for a very low wage can get a voucher worth $ 2,600 a year for up to two year to go to their local community college or wherever else they want to get the skill they need to improve their life let us empower people in this way move it from the government directly to the worker of america

 now any one of we can call for a tax cut but i will not accept one that explode the deficit or put our recovery at risk we ought to pay for our tax cut fully and honestly

 just two year ago it be an open question whether we would find the strength to cut the deficit thank to the courage of the people who be here then many of whom do not return we do cut the deficit we begin to do what other say would not be do we cut the deficit by over $ 600 billion about $ 10,000 for every family in this country it be come down three year in a row for the first time since mr. truman be president and i do not think anybody in america want we to let it explode again

 in the budget i will send you the middle class bill of right be fully pay for by budget cut in bureaucracy cut in program cut in special interest subsidy and the spending cut will more than double the tax cut my budget pay for the middle class bill of right without any cut in medicare and i will oppose any attempt to pay for tax cut with medicare cut that be not the right thing to do

 i know that a lot of you have your own idea about tax relief and some of they i find quite interesting i really want to work with all of you my test for our proposal will be will it create job and raise income will it strengthen our family and support our child be it pay for will it build the middle class and shrink the underclass if it do i will support it but if it do not i will not

 the goal of build the middle class and shrink the underclass be also why i believe that you should raise the minimum wage it reward work two and a half million americans two and a half million americans often woman with child be work out there today for $ 4.25 an hour in term of real buying power by next year that minimum wage will be at a 40 year low that be not my idea of how the new economy ought to work

 now i have study the argument and the evidence for and against a minimum wage increase i believe the weight of the evidence be that a modest increase do not cost job and may even lure people back into the job market but the most important thing be you can not make a living on $ 4.25 an hour especially if you have child even with the work family tax cut we pass last year in the past the minimum wage have be a bipartisan issue and i think it should be again so i want to challenge you to have honest hearing on this to get together to find a way to make the minimum wage a living wage

 member of congress have be here less than a month but by the end of the week 28 day into the new year every member of congress will have earn as much in congressional salary as a minimum wage worker make all year long

 everybody else here include the president have something else that too many americans do without and that be health care now last year we almost come to blow over health care but we do not do anything and the cold hard fact be that since last year since i be here another 1.1 million americans in work family have lose their health care and the cold hard fact be that many million more most of they farmer and small business people and self employ people have see their premium skyrocket their co pay and deductible go up there be a whole bunch of people in this country that in the statistic have health insurance but really what they have get be a piece of paper that say they will not lose their home if they get sick

 now i still believe our country have get to move toward provide health security for every american family but i know that last year as the evidence indicate we bit off more than we could chew so i be ask you that we work together let us do it step by step let us do whatever we have to do to get something do let us at least pass meaningful insurance reform so that no american risk lose coverage for face skyrocket price that nobody lose their coverage because they face high price or unavailable insurance when they change job or lose a job or a family member get sick

 i want to work together with all of you who have an interest in this with the democrats who work on it last time with the republican leader like senator dole who have a longtime commitment to health care reform and make some constructive proposal in this area last year we ought to make sure that self employ people in small business can buy insurance at more affordable rate through voluntary purchasing pool we ought to help family provide long term care for a sick parent or a disabled child we can work to help worker who lose their job at least keep their health insurance coverage for a year while they look for work and we can find a way it may take some time but we can find a way to make sure that our child have health care

 you know i think everybody in this room without regard to party can be proud of the fact that our country be rate as have the world 's most productive economy for the first time in nearly a decade but we can not be proud of the fact that we be the only wealthy country in the world that have a small percentage of the work force and their child with health insurance today than we do 10 year ago the last time we be the most productive economy in the world so let us work together on this it be too important for politic as usual

 much of what the american people be think about tonight be what we have already talk about a lot of people think that the security concern of america today be entirely internal to our border they relate to the security of our job and our home and our income and our child our street our health and protect those border now that the cold war have pass it be tempting to believe that all the security issue with the possible exception of trade reside here at home but it be not so our security still depend upon our continued world leadership for peace and freedom and democracy we still can not be strong at home unless we be strong abroad

 the financial crisis in mexico be a case in point i know it be not popular to say it tonight but we have to act not for the mexican people but for the sake of the million of americans whose livelihood be tie to mexico 's well being if we want to secure american job preserve american export safeguard america 's border then we must pass the stabilization program and help to put mexico back on track

 now let i repeat it be not a loan it be not foreign aid it be not a bailout we will be give a guarantee like cosign a note with good collateral that will cover our risk this legislation be the right thing for america that be why the bipartisan leadership have support it and i hope you in congress will pass it quickly it be in our interest and we can explain it to the american people because we be go to do it in the right way

 you know tonight this be the first state of the union address ever deliver since the beginning of the cold war when not a single russian missile be point at the child of america and along with the russians we be on our way to destroy the missile and the bomber that carry 9,000 nuclear warhead we have come so far so fast in this post cold war world that it be easy to take the decline of the nuclear threat for grant but it be still there and we be not finish yet

 this year i will ask the senate to approve start ii to eliminate weapon that carry 5,000 more warhead the united states will lead the charge to extend indefinitely the nuclear non proliferation treaty to enact a comprehensive nuclear test ban and to eliminate chemical weapon to stop and roll back north korea 's potentially deadly nuclear program we will continue to implement the agreement we have reach with that nation it be smart it be tough it be a deal base on continue inspection with safeguard for our ally and ourselves

 this year i will submit to congress comprehensive legislation to strengthen our hand in combat terrorist whether they strike at home or abroad as the coward who bomb the world trade center find out this country will hunt down terrorist and bring they to justice

 just this week another horrendous terrorist act in israel kill 19 and injure score more on behalf of the american people and all of you i send our deep sympathy to the family of the victim i know that in the face of such evil it be hard for the people in the middle east to go forward but the terrorist represent the past not the future we must and we will pursue a comprehensive peace between israel and all her neighbor in the middle east

 accordingly last night i sign an executive order that will block the asset in the united states of terrorist organization that threaten to disrupt the peace process it prohibit financial transaction with these group and tonight i call on all our ally and peace love nation throughout the world to join we with renew fervor in a global effort to combat terrorism we can not permit the future to be mar by terror and fear and paralysis

 from the day i take the oath of office i pledge that our nation would maintain the well equip well train and well prepare military on earth we have and they be they have manage the dramatic downsizing of our force after the cold war with remarkable skill and spirit but to make sure our military be ready for action and to provide the pay and the quality of life the military and their family deserve i be ask the congress to add $ 25 billion in defense spending over the next six year

 i have visit many basis at home and around the world since i become president tonight i repeat that request with renew conviction we ask a very great deal of our armed force now that they be small in number we ask more of they they go out more often to more different place and stay long they be call to service in many many way and we must give they and their family what the time demand and what they have earn

 just think about what our troop have do in the last year show america at its good help to save hundred of thousand of people in rwanda move with lightning speed to head off another threat to kuwait give freedom and democracy back to the people of haiti we have proudly support peace and prosperity and freedom from south africa to northern ireland from central and eastern europe to asia from latin america to the middle east all these endeavor be good in those place but they make our future more confident and more secure

 well my fellow americans that be my agenda for america 's future expand opportunity not bureaucracy enhance security at home and abroad empower our people to make the most of their own life it be ambitious and achievable but it be not enough we even need more than new idea for change the world or equip americans to compete in the new economy more than a government that be small smart and wise more than all of the change we can make in government and in the private sector from the outside in

 our fortune and our posterity also depend upon our ability to answer some question from within from the value and voice that speak to our heart as well as our head voice that tell we we have to do more to accept responsibility for ourselves and our family for our community and yes for our fellow citizen we see our family and our community all over this country come apart and we feel the common ground shift from under we the pta the town hall meeting the ball park it be hard for a lot of overworked parent to find the time and space for those thing that strengthen the bond of trust and cooperation too many of our child do not even have parent and grandparent who can give they those experience that they need to build their own character and their sense of identity

 we all know what while we here in this chamber can make a difference on those thing that the real difference will be make by our fellow citizen where they work and where they live and that it will be make almost without regard to party when i use to go to the softball park in little rock to watch my daughter 's league and people would come up to i father and mother and talk to i i can honestly say i have no idea whether 90 percent of they be republicans or democrats when i visit the relief center after the flood in california northern california last week a woman come up to i and do something that very few of you would do she hug i and say mr. president i be a republican but i be glad you be here laughter

 now why we can not wait for disaster to act the way we use to act every day because as we move into this next century everybody matter we do not have a person to waste and a lot of people be lose a lot of chance to do well that mean that we need a new covenant for everybody

 for our corporate and business leader we be go to work here to keep bring the deficit down to expand market to support their success in every possible way but they have an obligation when they be do well to keep job in our community and give their worker a fair share of the prosperity they generate

 for people in the entertainment industry in this country we applaud your creativity and your worldwide success and we support your freedom of expression but you do have a responsibility to assess the impact of your work and to understand the damage that come from the incessant repetitive mindless violence and irresponsible conduct that permeate our medium all the time

 we have get to ask our community leader and all kind of organization to help we stop our most serious social problem the epidemic of teen pregnancy and birth where there be no marriage i have send to congress a plan to target school all over this country with antipregnancy program that work but government can only do so much tonight i call on parent and leader all across this country to join together in a national campaign against teen pregnancy to make a difference we can do this and we must

 and i would like to say a special word to our religious leader you know i be proud of the fact the united states have more house of worship per capita than any country in the world these people who lead our house of worship can ignite their congregation to carry their faith into action can reach out to all of our child to all of the people in distress to those who have be savage by the breakdown of all we hold dear because so much of what must be do must come from the inside out and our religious leader and their congregation can make all the difference they have a role in the new covenant as well

 there must be more responsibility for all of our citizen you know it take a lot of people to help all the kid in trouble stay off the street and in school it take a lot of people to build the habitat for humanity house that the speaker celebrate on his lapel pin it take a lot of people to provide the people power for all of the civic organization in this country that make our community mean so much to most of we when we be kid it take every parent to teach the child the difference between right and wrong and to encourage they to learn and grow and to say no to the wrong thing but also to believe that they can be whatever they want to be

 i know it be hard when you be work hard for less when you be under great stress to do these thing a lot of our people do not have the time or the emotional stress they think to do the work of citizenship

 most of we in politic have not help very much for year we have mostly treat citizen like they be consumer or spectator sort of political couch potato who be suppose to watch the tv ad either promise they something for nothing or play on their fear and frustration and more and more of our citizen now get most of their information in very negative and aggressive way that be hardly conducive to honest and open conversation but the truth be we have get to stop see each other as enemy just because we have different view

 if you go back to the beginning of this country the great strength of america as de tocqueville point out when he come here a long time ago have always be our ability to associate with people who be different from ourselves and to work together to find common ground and in this day everybody have a responsibility to do more of that we simply can not want for a tornado a fire or a flood to behave like americans ought to behave in deal with one another

 i want to finish up here by point out some folk that be up with the first lady that represent what i be try to talk about citizen i have no idea what their party affiliation be or who they vote for in the last election but they represent what we ought to be do

 cindy perry teach second grader to read in americorps in rural kentucky she gain when she give she be a mother of four she say that her service inspire she to get her high school equivalency last year she be marry when she be a teenager stand up cindy she be marry when she be a teenager she have four child but she have time to serve other people to get her high school equivalency and she be go to use her americorps money to go back to college

 chief stephen bishop be the police chief of kansas city he be be a national leader stand up steve he be be a national leader in use more police in community policing and he be work with americorps to do it and the crime rate in kansas city have go down as a result of what he do

 corporal gregory depestre go to haiti as part of his adopt country 's force to help secure democracy in his native land and i might add we must be the only country in the world that could have go to haiti and take haitian americans there who could speak the language and talk to the people and he be one of they and we be proud of he

 the next two folk i have have the honor of meeting and get to know a little bit the reverend john and the reverend diana cherry of the ame zion church in temple hills maryland i would like to ask they to stand i want to tell you about they in the early 80 they leave government service and form a church in a small living room in a small house in the early 80 today that church have 17,000 member it be one of the three or four big church in the entire united states it grow by 200 a month they do it together and the special focus of their ministry be keep family together

 two thing they do make a big impression on i i visit their church once and i learn they be build a new sanctuary close to the washington dc line in a high crime high drug rate area because they think it be part of their ministry to change the life of the people who need they the second thing i want to say be that once reverend cherry be at a meeting at the white house with some other religious leader and he leave early to go back to this church to minister to 150 couple that he have bring back to his church from all over america to convince they to come back together to save their marriage and to raise their kid this be the kind of work that citizen be do in america we need more of it and it ought to be lift up and support

 the last person i want to introduce be jack lucas from hattiesburg mississippi jack would you stand up fifty year ago in the sand of iwo jima jack lucas teach and learn the lesson of citizenship on february 20 1945 he and three of his buddy encounter the enemy and two grenade at their foot jack lucas throw himself on both of they in that moment he save the life of his companion and miraculously in the next instant a medic save his life he gain a foothold for freedom and at the age of 17 just a year old than his grandson who be up there with he today and his son who be a west point graduate and a veteran at 17 jack lucas become the young marine in history and the young soldier in this century to win the congressional medal of honor all these year later yesterday here be what he say about that day it do not matter where you be from or who you be you rely on one another you do it for your country

 we all gain when we give and we reap what we sow that be at the heart of this new covenant responsibility opportunity and citizenship more than stale chapter in some remote civic book they be still the virtue by which we can fulfill ourselves and reach our god give potential and be like they and also to fulfill the eternal promise of this country the endure dream from that first and most sacred covenant i believe every person in this country still believe that we be create equal and give by our creator the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness this be a very very great country and our good day be still to come

 thank you and god bless you all



thank you very much governor keating and mrs. keating reverend graham to the family of those who have be lose and wound to the people of oklahoma city who have endure so much and the people of this wonderful state to all of you who be here as our fellow americans

 if ever we need evidence of that i could only recall the word of governor and mrs. keating if anybody think that americans be mostly mean and selfish they ought to come to oklahoma if anybody think americans have lose the capacity for love and caring and courage they ought to come to oklahoma

 to all my fellow americans beyond this hall i say one thing we owe those who have sacrifice be the duty to purge ourselves of the dark force which give rise to this evil they be force that threaten our common peace our freedom our way of life

 let we teach our child that the god of comfort be also the god of righteousness those who trouble their own house will inherit the wind justice will prevail

 let we let our own child know that we will stand against the force of fear when there be talk of hatred let we stand up and talk against it when there be talk of violence let we stand up and talk against it in the face of death let we honor life as st. paul admonish we let we not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good

 yesterday hillary and i have the privilege of speak with some child of other federal employee child like those who be lose here and one little girl say something we will never forget she say we should all plant a tree in memory of the child so this morning before we get on the plane to come here at the white house we plant that tree in honor of the child of oklahoma it be a dogwood with its wonderful spring flower and its deep endure root it embody the lesson of the psalms that the life of a good person be like a tree whose leaf do not wither

 my fellow americans a tree take a long time to grow and wound take a long time to heal but we must begin those who be lose now belong to god some day we will be with they but until that happen their legacy must be our life

 thank you all and god bless you

thank you very much to the members of congress who be here member of the cabinet and the administration my fellow americans
 in recent week i have begin a conversation with the american people about our fate and our duty to prepare our nation not only to meet the new century but to live and lead in a world transform to a degree seldom see in all of our history much of this change be good but it be not all good and all of we be affect by it therefore we must reach beyond our fear and our division to a new time of great and common purpose
 our challenge be twofold first to restore the american dream of opportunity and the american value of responsibility and second to bring our country together amid all our diversity into a strong community so that we can find common ground and move forward as one
 more than ever these two endeavor be inseparable i be absolutely convinced we can not restore economic opportunity or solve our social problem unless we find a way to bring the american people together to bring our people together we must openly and honestly deal with the issue that divide we today i want to discuss one of those issue affirmative action
 it be in a way ironic that this issue should be divisive today because affirmative action begin 25 year ago by a republican president with bipartisan support it begin simply as a means to an end of endure national purpose equal opportunity for all americans
 so let we today trace the root of affirmative action in our never end search for equal opportunity let we determine what it be and what it be not let we see where it be work and where it have not and ask ourselves what we need to do now along the way let we remember always that find common ground as we move toward the 21st century depend fundamentally on our share commitment to equal opportunity for all americans it be a moral imperative a constitutional mandate and a legal necessity
 there could be no well place for this discussion than the national archives for within these wall be america 's bedrock of our common ground the declaration of independence the constitution the bill of rights no paper be as lasting as the word these document contain so we put they in these special case to protect the parchment from the element no building be as solid as the principle these document embody but we sure try to build one with these metal door 11 inch thick to keep they safe for these document be america 's only crown jewel but the good place of all to hold these word and these principle be the one place in which they can never fade and never grow old in the strong chamber of our heart
 beyond all else our country be a set of conviction we hold these truth to be self evident that all man be create equal that they be endow by their creator with certain inalienable right that among these be life liberty and the pursuit of happiness our whole history can be see first as an effort to preserve these right and then as an effort to make they real in the life of all our citizen
 we know that from the beginning there be a great gap between the plain meaning of our creed and the mean reality of our daily life back then only white male property owner could vote black slave be not even count as whole people and native americans be regard as little more than an obstacle to our great national progress no wonder thomas jefferson reflect on slavery say he tremble to think god be just
 on the 200th anniversary of our great constitution justice thurgood marshall the grandson of a slave say the government our founder devise be defective from the start require several amendment a civil war and momentous social transformation to attain the system of constitutional government and its respect for the individual freedom and human right we hold as fundamental today
 emancipation woman 's suffrage civil right voting right equal right the struggle for the right of the disabled all these and other struggle be milestone on america 's often rocky but fundamentally righteous journey to close the gap between the ideal enshrine in these treasure here in the national archives and the reality of our daily life
 i first come to this very spot where i be stand today 32 year ago this month i be a 16 year old delegate to the american legion boys nation now that summer be a high water mark for our national journey
 that be the summer that president kennedy order alabama national guardsmen to enforce a court order to allow two young black to enter the university of alabama as he tell our nation every american ought to have the right to be treat as he would wish to be treat as one would wish his child to be treat
 later that same summer on the step of the lincoln memorial martin luther king tell americans of his dream that one day the son of former slave and the son of former slaveowner would sit down together at the table of brotherhood that one day his four little child would be judge not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character his word capture the heart and steel the will of million of americans some of they sing with he in the hot sun that day million more like i listen and weep in the privacy of their home
 it be hard to believe where we be just three decade ago when i come up here to boys nation and we have this mock congressional session i be one of only three or four southerner who would even vote for the civil right plank that be largely because of my family my grandfather have a grade school education and run a grocery store across the street from the cemetery in hope arkansas where my parent and my grandparent be bury most of his customer be black be poor and be work people as a child in that store i see that people of different race could treat each other with respect and dignity but i also see that the black neighborhood across the street be the only one in town where the street be not pave and when i return to that neighborhood in the late sixty to see a woman who have care for i as a toddler the street still be not pave a lot of you know that i be an ardent movie goer as a child i never go to a movie where i could sit next to a black american they be always sit upstairs
 in the 1960 's believe it or not there be still a few courthouse square in my state where the restroom be mark white and color i graduate from a segregated high school 7 year after president eisenhower integrate little rock central high school and when president kennedy barely carry my home state in 1960 the poll tax system be still alive and well there
 even though my grandparent be in a minority be poor southern white who be pro civil right i think most other people know well than to think the way they do and those who be smart enough to act differently discover a lesson that we ought to remember today discrimination be not just morally wrong it hurt everybody
 in 1960 atlanta georgia in reaction to all the thing that be go on all across the south adopt the motto the city too busy to hate and however imperfectly over the year they try to live by it i be convinced that atlanta 's success it now be home to more foreign corporation than any other american city and one year from today it will begin to host the olympics that that success all begin when people get too busy to hate
 the lesson we learn be a hard one when we allow people to pit we against one another or spend energy deny opportunity base on our difference everyone be hold back but when we give all americans a chance to develop and use their talent to be full partner in our common enterprise then everybody be push forward
 my experience with discrimination be root in the south and in the legacy slavery leave i also live with a work mother and a work grandmother when woman 's work be far rare and far more circumscribed than it be today but we all know there be million of other story those of hispanics asian americans native americans people with disability other against whom finger have be point many of you have your own story and that be why you be here today people who be deny the right to develop and to use their full human potential and their progress too be a part of our journey to make the reality of america consistent with the principle just behind i here
 thirty year ago in this city you do not see many people of color or woman make their way to work in the morning in business clothe or serve in substantial number in powerful position in congress or at the white house or make executive decision every day in business in fact even the employment want ad be divide man on one side and woman on the other it be extraordinary then to see woman or people of color as television news anchor or believe it or not even in college sport there be far few woman and minority as job supervisor or firefighter or police officer or doctor or lawyer or college professor or in many other job that offer stability and honor and integrity to family life
 a lot have change and it do not happen as some sort of random evolutionary drift it take hard work and sacrifice and countless act of courage and conscience by million of americans it take the political courage and statesmanship of democrats and republicans alike the vigilance and compassion of court and advocate in and out of government commit to the constitution and to equal protection and to equal opportunity it take the leadership of people in business who know that in the end we would all be well it take the leadership of people in labor union who know that work people have to be reconcile
 some people like congressman lewis there put their life on the line other people lose their life and million of americans change their own life and put hate behind they as a result today all our life be well woman have become a major force in business and political life and far more able to contribute to their family income a true and grow black middle class have emerge high education have literally be revolutionize with woman and racial and ethnic minority attend once overwhelmingly white and sometimes all male school in community across our nation police department now well reflect the makeup of those whom they protect a generation of professional now serve as role model for young woman and minority youth hispanic and new immigrant population be succeed in make america strong
 for an example of where the good of our future lie just think about our space program and the stunning hookup with the russian space station this month let us remember that that program the world 's fine begin with hero like alan shepard and senator john glenn but today it be have american hero like sally ride ellen ochoa leroy chiao guy bluford and other outstanding completely qualified woman and minority
 how do this happen fundamentally because we open our heart and mind and change our way but not without pressure the pressure of court decision legislation executive action and the power of example in the public and private sector along the way we learn that law alone do not change society that old habit and think pattern be deeply ingrained and die hard that more be require to really open the door of opportunity our search to find way to move more quickly to equal opportunity lead to the development of what we now call affirmative action
 the purpose of affirmative action be to give our nation a way to finally address the systemic exclusion of individual of talent on the basis of their gender or race from opportunity to develop perform achieve and contribute affirmative action be an effort to develop a systematic approach to open the door of education employment and business development opportunity to qualified individual who happen to be member of group that have experience longstanding and persistent discrimination
 it be a policy that grow out of many year of try to navigate between two unacceptable past one be to say simply that we declare discrimination illegal and that be enough we see that that way still relegate black with college degree to job as railroad porter and keep woman with degree under a glass ceiling with a low paycheck
 the other path be simply to try to impose change by level draconian penalty on employer who do not meet certain impose ultimately arbitrary and sometimes unachievable quota that too be reject out of a sense of fairness
 so a middle ground be develop that would change an inequitable status quo gradually but firmly by build the pool of qualified applicant for college for contract for job and give more people the chance to learn work and earn when affirmative action be do right it be flexible it be fair and it work
 i know some people be honestly concerned about the time affirmative action do not work when it be do in the wrong way and i know there be time when some employer do not use it in the right way they may cut corner and treat a flexible goal as a quota they may give opportunity to people who be unqualified instead of those who deserve it they may in so do allow a different kind of discrimination when this happen it be also wrong but it be not affirmative action and it be not legal
 so when our administration find case of that sort we will enforce the law aggressively the justice department file hundred of case every year attack discrimination in employment include suit on behalf of white male most of these suit however affect woman and minority for a simple reason because the vast majority of discrimination in america be still discrimination against they but the law do require fairness for everyone and we be determined to see that that be exactly what the law deliver
 let i be clear about what affirmative action must not mean and what i will not allow it to be it do not mean and i do not favor the unjustified preference of the unqualified over the qualified of any race or gender it do not mean and i do not favor numerical quota it do not mean and i do not favor rejection or selection of any employee or student solely on the basis of race or gender without regard to merit
 like many business executive and public servant i owe it to you to say that my view on this subject be more than anything else the product of my personal experience i have have experience with affirmative action nearly 20 year of it now and i know it work
 when i be attorney general of my home state i hire a record number of woman and african american lawyer every one clearly qualified and exceptionally hardworking as governor i appoint more woman to my cabinet and state board than any other governor in the state 's history and more african americans than all the governors in the state 's history combine and no one ever question their qualification or performance and our state be well and strong because of their service
 as president i be proud to have the most diverse administration in history in my cabinet my agency and my staff and i must say i have be surprised at the criticism i have receive from some quarter in my determination to achieve this
 in the last 2 1/2 year the most outstanding example of affirmative action in the united states the pentagon have open 260,000 position for woman who serve in our armed forces i have appoint more woman and minority to the federal bench than any other president more than the last two combine and yet far more of our judicial appointment have receive the high rating from the american bar association than any other administration since those rating have be give
 in our administration many government agency be do more business with qualified firm run by minority and woman the small business administration have reduce its budget by 40 percent double its loan output dramatically increase the number of loan to woman and minority small business people without reduce the number of loan to white businessowner who happen to be male and without change the loan standard for a single solitary application quality and diversity can go hand in hand and they must
 let i say that affirmative action have also do more than just open the door of opportunity to individual americans most economist who study it agree that affirmative action have also be an important part of closing gap in economic opportunity in our society thereby strengthen the entire economy
 a group of distinguished business leader tell i just a couple of day ago that their company be strong and their profit be large because of the diversity and the excellence of their work force achieve through intelligent and fair affirmative action program and they say we have go far beyond anything the government might require we to do because manage diversity and individual opportunity and be fair to everybody be the key to our future economic success in the global marketplace
 now there be those who say my fellow americans that even good affirmative action program be no long need that it should be enough to resort to the court or the equal employment opportunity commission in case of actual provable individual discrimination because there be no long any systematic discrimination in our society in decide how to answer that let we consider the fact
 the unemployment rate for african americans remain about twice that of white the hispanic rate be still much high woman have narrow the earning gap but still make only 72 percent as much as man do for comparable job the average income for an hispanic woman with a college degree be still less than the average income of a white man with a high school diploma
 accord to the recently complete glass ceiling report sponsor by republican members of congress in the nation 's large company only six tenth of one percent of senior management position be hold by african americans four tenth of a percent by hispanic americans three tenth of a percent by asian americans woman hold between 3 and 5 percent of these position white male make up 43 percent of our work force but hold 95 percent of these job
 just last week the chicago federal reserve bank report that black home loan applicant be more than twice as likely to be deny credit as white with the same qualification and that hispanic applicant be more than 1 1/2 time as likely to be deny loan as white with the same qualification
 last year alone the federal government receive more than 90,000 complaint of employment discrimination base on race ethnicity or gender less than 3 percent be for reverse discrimination
 evidence abound in other way of the persistence of the kind of bigotry that can affect the way we think even if we be not conscious of it in hiring and promotion and business and educational decision
 crime and violence base on hate against asians hispanics african americans and other minority be still with we and i be sorry to say that the bad and most recent evidence of this involve a recent report of federal law enforcement official in tennessee attend an event literally overflow with racism a sickening reminder of just how pervasive these kind of attitude still be
 by the way i want to tell you that i be committed to find the truth about what happen there and to take appropriate action and i want to say that if anybody who work in federal law enforcement think that that kind of behavior be acceptable they ought to think about work someplace else
 now let us get to the other side of the argument if affirmative action have work and if there be evidence that discrimination still exist on a wide scale in way that be conscious and unconscious then why should we get rid of it as many people be urge some question the effectiveness or the fairness of particular affirmative action program i say to all of you those be fair question and they prompt the review of our affirmative action program about which i will talk in a few moment
 some question the fundamental purpose of the effort there be people who honestly believe that affirmative action always amount to group preference over individual merit that affirmative action always lead to reverse discrimination that ultimately therefore it demean those who benefit from it and discriminate against those who be not help by it
 i just have to tell you that all of you have to decide how you feel about that and all of our fellow country man and woman have to decide as well but i believe if there be no quota if we give no opportunity to unqualified people if we have no reverse discrimination and if when the problem end the program end that criticism be wrong that be what i believe but we should have this debate and everyone should ask the question
 now let us deal with what i really think be behind so much of this debate today there be a lot of people who oppose affirmative action today who support it for a very long time i believe they be respond to the sea change in the experience that most americans have in the world in which we live if you say now you be against affirmative action because the government be use its power or the private sector be use its power to help minority at the expense of the majority that give you a way of explain away the economic distress that a majority of americans honestly feel it give you a way of turn their resentment against the minority or against a particular government program instead of have an honest debate about how we all get into the fix we be in and what we be all go to do together to get out of it
 that explanation the affirmative action explanation for the fix we be in be just wrong it be just wrong affirmative action do not cause the great economic problem of the american middle class and because most minority or woman be either member of that middle class or people who be poor who be struggle to get into it we must also admit that affirmative action alone will not solve the problem of minority and woman who seek to be a part of the american dream to do that we have to have an economic strategy that reverse the decline in wage and the growth of poverty among work people without that woman minority and white male will all be in trouble in the future
 but it be wrong to use the anxiety of the middle class to divert the american people from the real cause of their economic distress the sweeping historic change take all the globe in its path and the specific policy or lack of they in our own country which have aggravate those challenge it be simply wrong to play politic with the issue of affirmative action and divide our country at a time when if we be really go to change thing we have to be unite
 i must say i think it be ironic that some of those not all but some of those who call for an end to affirmative action also advocate policy which will make the real economic problem of the anxious middle class even bad they talk about opportunity and be for equal opportunity for everyone and then they reduce investment in equal opportunity on an evenhanded basis for example if the real goal be economic opportunity for all americans why in the world would we reduce our investment in education from head start to affordable college loan why do not we make college loan available to every american instead
 if the real goal be empower all middle class americans and empower poor people to work their way into the middle class without regard to race or gender why in the world would the people who advocate that turn around and raise taxis on our poor working family or reduce the money available for education and training when they lose their job or they be live on poverty wage or increase the cost of housing for low income work people with child why would we do that if we be go to empower america we have to do more than talk about it we have to do it and we surely have learn that we can not empower all americans by a simple strategy of take opportunity away from some americans
 so to those who use this as a political strategy to divide we we must say no we must say no but to those who raise legitimate question about the way affirmative action work or who raise the large question about the genuine problem and anxiety of all the american people and their sense of be leave behind and treat unfairly we must say yes you be entitle to answer to your question we must say yes to that
 now that be why i order this review of all of our affirmative action program a review design to look at the fact not the politic of affirmative action this review conclude that affirmative action remain a useful tool for widen economic and educational opportunity the model use by the military the army in particular and i be delighted to have the commanding general of the army here today because he set such a fine example have be especially successful because it emphasize education and training ensure that it have a wide pool of qualified candidate for every level of promotion that approach have give we the most racially diverse and well qualified military in our history there be more opportunity for woman and minority there than ever before and now there be over 50 general and admiral who be hispanic asian or african americans
 we find that the education department target on have program target on under represent minority that do a great deal of good with the tiny of investment we find that these program comprise 40 cent of every $ 1,000 in the education department 's budget
 now college president will tell you that the education their school offer actually benefit from diversity college where young people get the education and make the personal and professional contact that will shape their life if their college look like the world they be go to live and work in and they learn from all different kind of people thing that they can not learn in book our system of high education be strong
 still i believe every child need the chance to go to college every child that mean every child have to have a chance to get affordable and repayable college loan pell grant for poor kid and a chance to do thing like join americorps and work their way through school every child be entitle to that that be not an argument against affirmative action it be an argument for more opportunity for more americans until everyone be reach
 as i say a moment ago the review find that the small business administration last year increase loan to minority by over two third loan to woman by over 80 percent do not decrease loan to white man and not a single loan go to an unqualified person people who never have a chance before to be part of the american system of free enterprise now have it no one be hurt in the process that make america strong
 this review also find that the executive order on employment practice of large federal contractor also have help to bring more fairness and inclusion into the work force
 since president nixon be here in my job america have use goal and timetable to preserve opportunity and to prevent discrimination to urge business to set high expectation for themselves and to realize those expectation but we do not and we will not use rigid quota to mandate outcome
 we also look at the way we award procurement contract under the program know as set aside there be no question that these program have help to build up firm own by minority and woman who historically have be exclude from the old boy network in these area it have help a new generation of entrepreneur to flourish open new path to self reliance and an economic growth in which all of we ultimately share because of the set aside business ready to compete have have a chance to compete a chance they would not have otherwise have
 but as with any government program set aside can be misapply misuse even intentionally abuse there be critic who exploit that fact as an excuse to abolish all these program regardless of their effect i believe they be wrong but i also believe base on our factual review we clearly need some reform so first we should crack down on those who take advantage of everyone else through fraud and abuse we must crack down on front and pass throughs people who pretend to be eligible for these program and be not that be wrong we also in offer new business a leg up must make sure that the set aside go to business that need they most we must really look and make sure that our standard for eligibility be fair and defensible we have to tighten the requirement to move business out of program once they have have a fair opportunity to compete the graduation requirement must mean something it must mean graduation there should be no permanent set aside for any company
 second we must and we will comply with the supreme court 's adarand decision of last month now in particular that mean focus set aside program on particular region and business sector where the problem of discrimination or exclusion be provable and be clearly require affirmative action i have direct the attorney general and the agency to move forward with compliance with adarand expeditiously
 but i also want to emphasize that the adarand decision do not dismantle affirmative action and do not dismantle set aside in fact while set strict standard to mandate reform of affirmative action it actually reaffirm the need for affirmative action and reaffirm the continue existence of systematic discrimination in the united states what the supreme court order the federal government to do be to meet the same more rigorous standard for affirmative action program that state and local government be order to meet several year ago and the good set aside program under that standard have be challenge and have survive
 third beyond discrimination we need to do more to help disadvantaged people and distressed community no matter what their race or gender there be place in our country where the free enterprise system simply do not reach it simply be not work to provide job and opportunity disproportionately these area in urban and rural america be highly populate by racial minority but not entirely to make this initiative work i believe the government must become a well partner for people in place in urban and rural america that be catch in a cycle of poverty and i believe we have to find way to get the private sector to assume their rightful role as a driver of economic growth
 it have always amazed i that we have give incentive to our business people to help to develop poor economy in other part of the world our neighbor in the caribbean our neighbor in other part of the world i have support this when not subject to their own abuse but we ignore the big source of economic growth available to the american economy the poor economy isolate within the united states of america
 there be those who say well even if we make the job available people would not work they have not try most of the people in disadvantaged community work today and most of they who do not work have a very strong desire to do so in central harlem 14 people apply for every single minimum wage job opening think how many more would apply if there be good job with a good future our job have to connect disadvantaged people and disadvantaged community to economic opportunity so that everybody who want to work can do so
 we have be work at this through our empowerment zone and community develop bank through the initiative of secretary cisneros of the housing and urban development department and many other thing that we have try to do to put capital where it be need and now i have ask vice president gore to develop a proposal to use our contracting to support business that locate themselves in these distressed area or hire a large percentage of their worker from these area not to supplement what we be do in affirmative action not to substitute for it but to supplement it to go beyond it to do something that will help to deal with the economic crisis of america we want to make our procurement system more responsive to people in these area who need help
 my fellow americans affirmative action have to be make consistent with our high ideal of personal responsibility and merit and our urgent need to find common ground and to prepare all americans to compete in the global economy of the next century
 today i be direct all our agency to comply with the supreme court 's adarand decision and also to apply the four standard of fairness to all our affirmative action program that i have already articulate no quota in theory or practice no illegal discrimination of any kind include reverse discrimination no preference for people who be not qualified for any job or other opportunity and as soon as a program have succeed it must be retire any program that do not meet these four principle must be eliminate or reform to meet they
 but let i be clear affirmative action have be good for america
 affirmative action have not always be perfect and affirmative action should not go on forever it should be change now to take care of those thing that be wrong and it should be retire when its job be do i be resolve that that day will come but the evidence suggest indeed scream that that day have not come
 the job of end discrimination in this country be not over that should not be surprising we have slavery for century before the passage of the 13th 14th and 15th amendment we wait another 100 year for the civil right legislation woman have have the vote less than 100 year we have always have difficulty with these thing as most society do but we be make more progress than many people
 base on the evidence the job be not do so here be what i think we should do we should reaffirm the principle of affirmative action and fix the practice we should have a simple slogan mend it but do not end it
 let i ask all americans whether they agree or disagree with what i have say today to see this issue in the large context of our time president lincoln say we can not escape our history we can not escape our future either and that future must be one in which every american have the chance to live up to his or her god give capacity
 the new technology the instant communication the explosion of global commerce have create enormous opportunity and enormous anxiety for americans in the last 2 1/2 year we have see 7 million new job more millionaire and new business than ever before high corporate profit and a booming stock market yet most americans be work hard for the same or low pay and they feel more insecurity about their job their retirement their health care and their child 's education too many of our child be clearly expose to poverty and welfare violence and drug
 these be the great challenge for our whole country on the homefront at the dawn of the 21st century we have get to find the wisdom and the will to create family wage job for all the people who want to work to open the door of college to all americans to strengthen family and reduce the awful problem to which our child be expose to move poor americans from welfare to work
 this be the work of our administration to give people the tool they need to make the most of their own life to give family and community the tool they need to solve their own problem but let we not forget affirmative action do not cause these problem it will not solve they and getting rid of affirmative action certainly will not solve they
 if properly do affirmative action can help we come together go forward and grow together it be in our moral legal and practical interest to see that every person can make the most of his own life in the fight for the future we need all hand on deck and some of those hand still need a help hand
 in our national community we be all different we be all the same we want liberty and freedom we want the embrace of family and community we want to make the most of our own life and we be determined to give our child a well one today there be voice of division who would say forget all that do not you dare remember we be still close the gap between our founder ideal and our reality but every step along the way have make we rich strong and well and the good be yet to come
 thank you very much and god bless you

thank you you know when i be a boy grow up in arkansas i think it highly—[applause]—i think it highly unlikely that i would ever become president of the united states perhaps the only thing even more unlikely be that i should ever have the opportunity to be cheer at the university of texas i must say i be very grateful for both of they laughter

 my fellow americans i want to begin by tell you that i be hopeful about america when i look at nikole bell up here introduce i and i shake hand with these other young student i look into their eye i see the americorps button on that gentleman 's shirt i be remind as i talk about this thorny subject of race today i be remind of what winston churchill say about the united states when president roosevelt be try to pass the lend lease act so that we could help britain in their war against nazi germany before we ourselves be involve and for a good while the issue be hang fire and it be unclear whether the congress would permit we to help britain who at that time be the only bulwark against tyranny in europe and winston churchill say i have great confidence in the judgment and the common sense of the american people and their leader they invariably do the right thing after they have examine every other alternative laughter so i say to you let i begin by say that i can see in the eye of these student and in the spirit of this moment we will do the right thing
 in recent week every one of we have be make aware of a simple truth white americans and black americans often see the same world in drastically different way way that go beyond and beneath the simpson trial and its aftermath which bring these perception so starkly into the open
 the rift we see before we that be tear at the heart of america exist in spite of the remarkable progress black americans have make in the last generation since martin luther king sweep america up in his dream and president johnson speak so powerfully for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy in demand that congress guarantee full voting right to black the rift between black and white exist still in a very special way in america in spite of the fact that we have become much more racially and ethnically diverse and that hispanic americans themselves no stranger to discrimination be now almost 10 percent of our national population
 the reason for this divide be many some be root in the awful history and stubborn persistence of racism some be root in the different way we experience the threat of modern life to personal security family value and strong community some be root in the fact that we still have not learn to talk frankly to listen carefully and to work together across racial line
 almost 30 year ago dr. martin luther king take his last march with sanitation worker in memphis they march for dignity equality and economic justice many carry placard that read simply i be a man the throng of man march in washington today almost all of they be do so for the same state reason but there be a profound difference between this march today and those of 30 year ago thirty year ago the marcher be demand the dignity and opportunity they be due because in the face of terrible discrimination they have work hard raise their child pay their taxis obey the law and fight our war
 well today 's march be also about pride and dignity and respect but after a generation of deepen social problem that disproportionately impact black americans it be also about black man take renew responsibility for themselves their family and their community it be about say no to crime and drug and violence it be about stand up for atonement and reconciliation it be about insist that other do the same and offer to help they it be about the frank admission that unless black man shoulder their load no one else can help they or their brother their sister and their child escape the hard bleak life that too many of they still face
 of course some of those in the march do have a history that be far from its message of atonement and reconciliation one million man be right to be stand up for personal responsibility but one million man do not make right one man 's message of malice and division no good house be ever build on a bad foundation nothing good ever come of hate so let we pray today that all who march and all who speak will stand for atonement for reconciliation for responsibility let we pray that those who have speak for hatred and division in the past will turn away from that past and give voice to the true message of those ordinary americans who march if that happen the man and the woman who be there with they will be march into well life for themselves and their family and they could be march into a well future for america
 today we face a choice one way lead to further separation and bitterness and more lost future the other way the path of courage and wisdom lead to unity to reconciliation to a rich opportunity for all americans to make the most of the life god give they this moment in which the racial divide be so clearly out in the open need not be a setback for we it present we with a great opportunity and we dare not let it pass we by
 in the past when we have have the courage to face the truth about our failure to live up to our own good ideal we have grow strong move forward and restore proud american optimism at such turning point america move to preserve the union and abolish slavery to embrace woman 's suffrage to guarantee basic legal right to america without regard to race under the leadership of president johnson at each of these moment we look in the national mirror and be brave enough to say this be not who we be we be well than that
 abraham lincoln remind we that a house divide against itself can not stand when division have threaten to bring our house down somehow we have always move together to shore it up my fellow americans our house be the great democracy in all human history and with all its racial and ethnic diversity it have beat the odd of human history but we know that division remain and we still have work to do
 the two world we see now each contain both truth and distortion both black and white americans must face this for honesty be the only gateway to the many act of reconciliation that will unite our world at last into one america
 white america must understand and acknowledge the root of black pain it begin with unequal treatment first in law and later in fact african americans indeed have live too long with a justice system that in too many case have be and continue to be less than just the record of abuse extend from lynching and trump up charge to false arrest and police brutality the tragedy of emmett till and rodney king be bloody marker on the very same road still today too many of our police officer play by the rule of the bad old day it be beyond wrong when law abide black parent have to tell their law abide child to fear the police whose salary be pay by their own taxis
 and black be right to think something be terribly wrong when african american man be many time more likely to be victim of homicide than any other group in this country when there be more african american man in our correction system than in our college when almost one in three african american man in their 20 ' be either in jail on parole or otherwise under the supervision of the criminal justice system nearly one in three and that be a disproportionate percentage in comparison to the percentage of black who use drug in our society now i would like every white person here and in america to take a moment to think how he or she would feel if one in three white man be in similar circumstance
 and there be still unacceptable economic disparity between black and white it be so fashionable to talk today about african americans as if they have be some sort of protect class many white think black be get more than their fair share in term of job and promotion that be not true that be not true
 the truth be that african americans still make on average about 60 percent of what white people do that more than half of african american child live in poverty and at the very time our young americans need access to college more than ever before black college enrollment be drop in america
 on the other hand black must understand and acknowledge the root of white fear in america there be a legitimate fear of the violence that be too prevalent in our urban area and often by experience or at least what people see on the news at night violence for those white people too often have a black face
 it be not racist for a parent to pull his or her child close when walk through a high crime neighborhood or to wish to stay away from neighborhood where innocent child can be shoot in school or stand at bus stop by thug drive by with assault weapon or tote handgun like old west desperado it be not racist for parent to recoil in disgust when they read about a national survey of gang member say that two third of they feel justified in shoot someone simply for show they disrespect it be not racist for white to say they do not understand why people put up with gang on the corner or in the project or with drug be sell in the school or in the open it be not racist for white to assert that the culture of welfare dependency out of wedlock pregnancy and absent fatherhood can not be break by social program unless there be first more personal responsibility
 the great potential for this march today beyond the black community be that white will come to see a large truth that black share their fear and embrace their conviction openly assert that without change in the black community and within individual real change for our society will not come
 this march could remind white people that most black people share their old fashioned american value for most black americans still do work hard care for their family pay their taxis and obey the law often under circumstance which be far more difficult than those their white counterpart face imagine how you would feel if you be a young parent in your 20 be with a young child live in a housing project work somewhere for $ 5 an hour with no health insurance pass every day people on the street sell drug make 100 time what you make those people be the real hero of america today and we should recognize that
 and white people too often forget that they be not immune to the problem black americans face crime drug domestic abuse and teen pregnancy they be too prevalent among white as well and some of those problem be grow fast in our white population than in our minority population
 so we all have a stake in solve these common problem together it be therefore wrong for white americans to do what they have do too often simply to move far away from the problem and support policy that will only make they bad
 finally both side seem to fear deep down inside that they will never quite be able to see each other as more than enemy face all of whom carry at least a sliver of bigotry in their heart difference of opinion root in different experience be healthy indeed essential for democracy but difference so great and so rooted in race threaten to divide the house mr. lincoln give his life to save as dr. king say we must learn to live together as brother or we will perish as fool
 recognize one another 's real grievance be only the first step we must all take responsibility for ourselves our conduct and our attitude america we must clean our house of racism
 to our white citizen i say i know most of you every day do your very good by your own light to live a life free of discrimination nevertheless too many destructive idea be gain currency in our midst the tape voice of one policeman should fill you with outrage and so i say we must clean the house of white america of racism americans who be in the white majority should be proud to stand up and be hear denounce the sort of racist rhetoric we hear on that tape so loudly and clearly denounce it that our black fellow citizen can hear we white racism may be black people 's burden but it be white people 's problem we must clean our house
 to our black citizen i honor the presence of hundred of thousand of man in washington today commit to atonement and to personal responsibility and the commitment of million of other man and woman who be african americans to this cause i call upon you to build on this effort to share equally in the promise of america but to do that your house too must be clean of racism there be too many today white and black on the left and the right on the street corner and the radio wave who seek to sow division for their own purpose to they i say no more we must be one
 long before we be so diverse our nation 's motto be e pluribus unum out of many we be one we must be one as neighbor as fellow citizen not separate camp but family white black latino all of we no matter how different who share basic american value and be willing to live by they
 when a child be gun down on a street in the bronx no matter what our race he be our american child when a woman die from a beating no matter what our race or her she be our american sister and every time drug course through the vein of another child it cloud the future of all our american child whether we like it or not we be one nation one family indivisible and for we divorce or separation be not option
 here in 1995 on the edge of the 21st century we dare not tolerate the existence of two americas under my watch i will do everything i can to see that as soon as possible there be only one one america under the rule of law one social contract commit not to winner take all but to give all americans a chance to win together one america
 well how do we get there first today i ask every governor every mayor every business leader every church leader every civic leader every union steward every student leader most important every citizen in every workplace and learn place and meet place all across america to take personal responsibility for reach out to people of different race for take time to sit down and talk through this issue to have the courage to speak honestly and frankly and then to have the discipline to listen quietly with an open mind and an open heart as other do the same
 this may seem like a simple request but for ten of million of americans this have never be a reality they have never speak and they have never listen not really not really i be convince base on a rich lifetime of friendship and common endeavor with people of different race that the american people will find out they have a lot more in common than they think they do
 the second thing we have to do be to defend and enhance real opportunity i be not talk about opportunity for black americans or opportunity for white americans i be talk about opportunity for all americans soon or later all our speaking all our listening all our caring have to lead to constructive action together for our word and our intention to have meaning we can do this first by truly rewarding work and family in government policy in employment policy in community practice
 we also have to realize that there be some area of our country whether in urban area or poor rural area like south texas or eastern arkansas where these problem be go to be more prevalent just because there be no opportunity there be only so much temptation some people can stand when they turn up against a brick wall day after day after day and if we can spread the benefit of education and free enterprise to those who have be deny they too long and who be isolate in enclave in this country then we have a moral obligation to do it it will be good for our country
 third and perhaps most important of all we have to give every child in this country and every adult who still need it the opportunity to get a good education president johnson understand that and now that i be privileged to have this job and to look back across the whole sweep of american history i can appreciate how truly historic his commitment to the simple idea that every child in this country ought to have an opportunity to get a good safe decent fulfil education be it be revolutionary then and it be revolutionary today
 today that matter more than ever i be try to do my part i be fight hard against effort to roll back family security aid to distressed community and support for education i want it to be easy for poor child to get off to a good start in school not hard i want it to be easy for everybody to go to college and stay there not hard i want to mend affirmative action but i do not think america be at a place today where we can end it the evidence of the last several week show that
 but let we remember the people march in washington today be right about one fundamental thing at its base this issue of race be not about government or political leader it be about what be in the heart and mind and life of the american people there will be no progress in the absence of real responsibility on the part of all americans nowhere be that responsibility more important than in our effort to promote public safety and preserve the rule of law
 law and order be the first responsibility of government our citizen must respect the law and those who enforce it police have a life and death responsibility never never to abuse the power grant they by the people we know by the way what work in fight crime also happen to improve relationship between the race what work in fight crime be community police we have see it work all across america the crime rate be down the murder rate be down where people relate to each other across the line of police and community in an open honest respectful supportive way we can lower crime and raise the state of race relation in america if we will remember this simple truth
 but if this be go to work police department have to be fair and engage with not estranged from their community i be committed to make this kind of community police a reality all across our country but you must be commit to make it a reality in your community we have to root out the remnant of racism in our police department we have get to get it out of our entire criminal justice system but just as the police have a sacred duty to protect the community fairly all of our citizen have a sacred responsibility to respect the police to teach our young people to respect they and then to support they and work with they so that they can succeed in make we safe
 let us not forget most police officer of whatever race be honest people who love the law and put their life on the line so that the citizen they be protect can lead decent secure life and so that their child can grow up to do the same
 finally i want to say on the day of this march a moment about a crucial area of responsibility the responsibility of fatherhood the single big social problem in our society may be the grow absence of father from their child 's home because it contribute to so many other social problem one child in four grow up in a fatherless home without a father to help guide without a father to care without a father to teach boy to be man and to teach girl to expect respect from man it be hard there be a lot of mother out there do a magnificent job alone a magnificent job alone but it be hard it be hard this of course be not a black problem or a latino problem or a white problem it be an american problem but it aggravate the condition of the racial divide
 i know from my own life it be hard because my own father die before i be bear and my stepfather 's battle with alcohol keep he from be the father he might have be but for all father parenting be not easy and every parent make mistake i know that too from my own experience the point be that we need people to be there for their child day after day build a family be the hard job a man can do but it be also the most important
 for those who be neglect their child i say it be not too late your child still need you to those who only send money in the form of child support i say keep send the check your kid count on they and we will catch you and enforce the law if you stop but the message of this march today one message be that your money be no replacement for your guiding your caring your love the child you bring into this world
 we can only build strong family when man and woman respect each other when they have partnership when man be as involve in the homeplace as woman have become involved in the workplace it mean among other thing that we must keep work until we end domestic violence against woman and child i hope those man in washington today pledge among other thing to never never raise their hand in violence against a woman
 so today my fellow americans i honor the black man march in washington to demonstrate their commitment to themselves their family and their community i honor the million of man and woman in america the vast majority of every color who without fanfare or recognition do what it take to be good father and good mother good worker and good citizen they all deserve the thank of america
 but when we leave here today what be you go to do what be you go to do let all of we who want to stand up against racism do our part to roll back the divide begin by seek out people in the workplace the classroom the community the neighborhood across town the place of worship to actually sit down and have those honest conversation i talk about conversation where we speak openly and listen and understand how other view this world of our
 make no mistake about it we can bridge this great divide this be after all a very great country and we have become great by what we have overcome we have the world 's strong economy and it be on the move but we have really last because we have understand that our success could never be measure solely by the size of our gross national product
 i believe the march in washington today spawn such an outpouring because it be a reflection of something deep and strong that be run throughout our american community i believe that in million and million of different way our entire country be reassert our commitment to the bedrock value that make our country great and that make life worth live
 the great divide of the past call for and be address by legal and legislative change they be address by leader like lyndon johnson who pass the civil rights act and the voting rights act and to be sure this great divide require a public response by democratically elect leader but today we be really deal and we know it with problem that grow in large measure out of the way all of we look at the world with our mind and the way we feel about the world with our heart
 and therefore while leader and legislation may be important this be work that have to be do by every single one of you and this be the ultimate test of our democracy for today the house divide exist largely in the mind and heart of the american people and it must be unite there in the mind and heart of our people
 yes there be some who would poison our progress by sell short the great character of our people and our enormous capacity to change and grow but they will not win the day we will win the day with your help with your help that day will come a lot soon i will do my part but you my fellow citizen must do your
 thank you and god bless you

good evening last week the war faction in bosnia reach a peace agreement as a result of our effort in dayton ohio and the support of our european and russian partner tonight i want to speak with you about implement the bosnian peace agreement and why our value and interest as americans require that we participate
 let i say at the outset america 's role will not be about fight a war it will be about help the people of bosnia to secure their own peace agreement our mission will be limit focused and under the command of an american general
 in fulfil this mission we will have the chance to help stop the killing of innocent civilian especially child and at the same time to bring stability to central europe a region of the world that be vital to our national interest it be the right thing to do
 from our birth america have always be more than just a place america have embody an idea that have become the ideal for billion of people throughout the world our founder say it well america be about life liberty and the pursuit of happiness in this century especially america have do more than simply stand for these ideal we have act on they and sacrifice for they our people fight two world wars so that freedom could triumph over tyranny after world war i we pull back from the world leave a vacuum that be fill by the force of hatred after world war ii we continue to lead the world we make the commitment that keep the peace that help to spread democracy that create unparalleled prosperity and that bring victory in the cold war
 today because of our dedication america 's ideal liberty democracy and peace be more and more the aspiration of people everywhere in the world it be the power of our idea even more than our size our wealth and our military might that make america a uniquely trust nation
 with the cold war over some people now question the need for our continue active leadership in the world they believe that much like after world war i america can now step back from the responsibility of leadership they argue that to be secure we need only to keep our own border safe and that the time have come now to leave to other the hard work of leadership beyond our border i strongly disagree
 as the cold war give way to the global village our leadership be need more than ever because problem that start beyond our border can quickly become problem within they we be all vulnerable to the organize force of intolerance and destruction terrorism ethnic religious and regional rivalry the spread of organized crime and weapon of mass destruction and drug trafficking just as surely as fascism and communism these force also threaten freedom and democracy peace and prosperity and they too demand american leadership
 but nowhere have the argument for our leadership be more clearly justify than in the struggle to stop or prevent war and civil violence from iraq to haiti from south africa to korea from the middle east to northern ireland we have stand up for peace and freedom because it be in our interest to do so and because it be the right thing to do
 now that do not mean we can solve every problem my duty as president be to match the demand for american leadership to our strategic interest and to our ability to make a difference america can not and must not be the world 's policeman we can not stop all war for all time but we can stop some war we can not save all woman and all child but we can save many of they we can not do everything but we must do what we can
 there be time and place where our leadership can mean the difference between peace and war and where we can defend our fundamental value as a people and serve our most basic strategic interest my fellow americans in this new era there be still time when america and america alone can and should make the difference for peace
 the terrible war in bosnia be such a case nowhere today be the need for american leadership more stark or more immediate than in bosnia for nearly 4 year a terrible war have tear bosnia apart horror we pray have be banish from europe forever have be sear into our mind again skeletal prisoner cage behind barb wire fence woman and girl rape as a tool of war defenseless man and boy shoot down into mass grave evoke vision of world war ii concentration camp and endless line of refugee march toward a future of despair
 when i take office some be urge immediate intervention in the conflict i decide that american ground troop should not fight a war in bosnia because the united states could not force peace on bosnia 's war ethnic group the serbs croats and muslims instead america have work with our european ally in search for peace stop the war from spread and ease the suffering of the bosnian people
 we impose tough economic sanction on serbia we use our air power to conduct the long humanitarian airlift in history and to enforce a no fly zone that take the war out of the sky we help to make peace between two of the three war party the muslims and the croats but as the month of war turn into year it become clear that europe alone could not end the conflict
 this summer bosnian serb shell once again turn bosnia 's playground and marketplace into kill field in response the united states lead nato 's heavy and continuous air strike many of they fly by skilled and brave american pilot those air strike together with the renew determination of our european partner and the bosnian and croat gain on the battlefield convince the serbs finally to start think about make peace
 at the same time the united states initiate an intensive diplomatic effort that forge a bosnia wide cease fire and get the party to agree to the basic principle of peace three dedicated american diplomat bob frasure joe kruzel and nelson drew lose their life in that effort tonight we remember their sacrifice and that of their family and we will never forget their exceptional service to our nation
 finally just 3 week ago the muslims croats and serbs come to dayton ohio in america 's heartland to negotiate a settlement there exhaust by war they make a commitment to peace they agree to put down their gun to preserve bosnia as a single state to investigate and prosecute war criminal to protect the human right of all citizen to try to build a peaceful democratic future and they ask for america 's help as they implement this peace agreement
 america have a responsibility to answer that request to help to turn this moment of hope into an endure reality to do that troop from our country and around the world would go into bosnia to give they the confidence and support they need to implement their peace plan i refuse to send american troop to fight a war in bosnia but i believe we must help to secure the bosnian peace
 i want you to know tonight what be at stake exactly what our troop will be ask to accomplish and why we must carry out our responsibility to help implement the peace agreement implement the agreement in bosnia can end the terrible suffering of the people the warfare the mass execution the ethnic cleansing the campaign of rape and terror let we never forget a quarter of a million man woman and child have be shell shot and torture to death two million people half of the population be force from their home and into a miserable life as refugee and these faceless number hide million of real personal tragedy for each of the war 's victim be a mother or daughter a father or son a brother or sister
 now the war be over american leadership create the chance to build a peace and stop the suffering secure peace in bosnia will also help to build a free and stable europe bosnia lie at the very heart of europe next door to many of its fragile new democracy and some of our close ally generation of americans have understand that europe 's freedom and europe 's stability be vital to our own national security that be why we fight two war in europe that be why we launch the marshall plan to restore europe that be why we create nato and wage the cold war and that be why we must help the nation of europe to end their bad nightmare since world war ii now
 the only force capable of get this job do be nato the powerful military alliance of democracy that have guarantee our security for half a century now and as nato 's leader and the primary broker of the peace agreement the united states must be an essential part of the mission if we be not there nato will not be there the peace will collapse the war will reignite the slaughter of innocent will begin again a conflict that already have claim so many victim could spread like poison throughout the region eat away at europe 's stability and erode our partnership with our european ally
 and america 's commitment to leadership will be question if we refuse to participate in implement a peace agreement we broker right here in the united states especially since the president of bosnia croatia and serbia all ask we to participate and all pledge their good effort to the security of our troop
 when america 's partnership be weak and our leadership be in doubt it undermine our ability to secure our interest and to convince other to work with we if we do maintain our partnership and our leadership we need not act alone as we see in the gulf war and in haiti many other nation who share our goal will also share our burden but when america do not lead the consequence can be very grave not only for other but eventually for we as well
 as i speak to you nato be complete its planning for ifor an international force for peace in bosnia of about 60,000 troop already more than 25 other nation include our major nato ally have pledge to take part they will contribute about two third of the total implementation force some 40,000 troop the united states would contribute the rest about 20,000 soldier
 later this week the final nato plan will be submit to i for review and approval let i make clear what i expect it to include and what it must include for i to give final approval to the participation of our armed forces
 first the mission will be precisely define with clear realistic goal that can be achieve in a definite period of time our troop will make sure that each side withdraw its force behind the frontline and keep they there they will maintain the cease fire to prevent the war from accidentally start again these effort in turn will help to create a secure environment so that the people of bosnia can return to their home vote in free election and begin to rebuild their life our joint chiefs of staff have conclude that this mission should and will take about one year
 second the risk to our troop will be minimize american troop will take their order from the american general who command nato they will be heavily armed and thoroughly train by make an overwhelming show of force they will lessen the need to use force but unlike the u.n. force they will have the authority to respond immediately and the training and the equipment to respond with overwhelming force to any threat to their own safety or any violation of the military provision of the peace agreement
 if the nato plan meet with my approval i will immediately send it to congress and request its support i will also authorize the participation of a small number of american troop in a nato advance mission that will lay the groundwork for ifor start sometime next week they will establish headquarters and set up the sophisticated communication system that must be in place before nato can send in its troop tank and truck to bosnia
 the implementation force itself would begin deploy in bosnia in the day follow the formal signature of the peace agreement in mid december the international community will help to implement arm control provision of the agreement so that future hostility be less likely and armament be limited while the world community the united states and other will also make sure that the bosnian federation have the mean to defend itself once ifor withdraw ifor will not be a part of this effort
 civilian agency from around the world will begin a separate program of humanitarian relief and reconstruction principally pay for by our european ally and other interested country this effort be also absolutely essential to make the peace endure it will bring the people of bosnia the food shelter clothing and medicine so many have be deny for so long it will help they to rebuild to rebuild their road and school their power plant and hospital their factory and shop it will reunite child with their parent and family with their home it will allow the bosnians freely to choose their own leader it will give all the people of bosnia a much great stake in peace than war so that peace take on a life and a logic of its own
 in bosnia we can and will succeed because our mission be clear and limited and our troop be strong and very well prepare but my fellow americans no deployment of american troop be risk free and this one may well involve casualty there may be accident in the field or incident with people who have not give up their hatred i will take every measure possible to minimize these risk but we must be prepare for that possibility
 as president my most difficult duty be to put the man and woman who volunteer to serve our nation in harm 's way when our interest and value demand it i assume full responsibility for any harm that may come to they but anyone contemplate any action that would endanger our troop should know this america protect its own anyone anyone who take on our troop will suffer the consequence we will fight fire with fire and then some
 after so much bloodshed and loss after so many outrageous act of inhuman brutality it will take an extraordinary effort of will for the people of bosnia to pull themselves from their past and start build a future of peace but with our leadership and the commitment of our ally the people of bosnia can have the chance to decide their future in peace they have a chance to remind the world that just a few short year ago the mosque and church of sarajevo be a shining symbol of multiethnic tolerance that bosnia once find unity in its diversity indeed the cemetery in the center of the city be just a few short year ago a magnificent stadium which host the olympics our universal symbol of peace and harmony bosnia can be that kind of place again we must not turn our back on bosnia now
 and so i ask all americans and i ask every member of congress democrat and republican alike to make the choice for peace in the choice between peace and war america must choose peace
 my fellow americans i ask you to think just for a moment about this century that be draw to close and the new one that will soon begin because previous generation of americans stand up for freedom and because we continue to do so the american people be more secure and more prosperous and all around the world more people than ever before live in freedom more people than ever before be treat with dignity more people than ever before can hope to build a well life that be what america 's leadership be all about
 we know that these be the blessing of freedom and america have always be freedom 's great champion if we continue to do everything we can to share these blessing with people around the world if we continue to be leader for peace then the next century can be the great time our nation have ever know
 a few week ago i be privileged to spend some time with his holiness pope john paul ii when he come to america at the very end of our meeting the pope look at i and say i have live through most of this century i remember that it begin with a war in sarajevo mr. president you must not let it end with a war in sarajevo
 in bosnia this terrible war have challenge our interest and trouble our soul thankfully we can do something about it i say again our mission will be clear limited and achievable the people of bosnia our nato ally and people all around the world be now look to america for leadership so let we lead that be our responsibility as americans
 goodnight and god bless america

 this year in armagh on st. patrick 's day protestant and catholic child lead the parade together for the first time since the troubles begin a bystander 's word mark the wonder of the occasion when he say even the normal be begin to seem normal
 the economic reward of peace be evident as well unemployment have fall here to its low level in 14 year while retail sale and investment be surge for from the gleam city center to the new shop front of belfast to the enterprise center in east belfast business be thrive and opportunity be expand with every extra day that the gun be still business confidence grow strong and the promise of prosperity grow as well
 as the shroud of terror melt away northern ireland 's beauty have be reveal again to all the world the castle and coast the giant 's causeway the lush green hill the high white cliff a magical backdrop to your great asset which i see all along the way from the airport here today the warmth and good feeling of your people visitor be now come in record number indeed today the air route between belfast and london be the second busy in all of europe
 i want to honor those whose courage and vision have bring we to this point prime minister major prime minister bruton and before he prime minister reynolds lay the background and the basis for this era of reconciliation from the downing street declaration to the joint framework document they alter the course of history now just in the last few day by launch the twin track initiative they have open a promising new gateway to a just and last peace foreign minister spring sir patrick mayhew david trimble and john hume all have labor to realize the promise of peace and gerry adams along with loyalist leader such as david ervine and gary mcmichael help to silence the gun on the street and to bring about the first peace in a generation
 but most of all america salute all the people of northern ireland who have show the world in concrete way that here the will for peace be now strong than the weapon of war with mixed sporting event encourage competition on the playing field not the battlefield with woman 's support group literacy program job training center that serve both community these and countless other initiative bolster the foundation of peace as well

 last year 's cease fire of the irish republican army join by the combine loyalist military command mark a turning point in the history of northern ireland now be the time to sustain that momentum and lock in the gain of peace neither community want to go back to the violence of the past the child tell of that today both party must do their part to move this process forward now
 let i begin by say that the search for common ground demand the courage of an open mind this twin track initiative give the party a chance to begin preliminary talk in way in which all view will be represent and all voice will be hear it also establish an international body to address the issue of arm decommissioning i hope the party will seize this opportunity engage in honest dialog be not an act of surrender it be an act of strength and common sense
 move from cease fire to peace require dialog for 25 year now the history of northern ireland have be write in the blood of its child and their parent the cease fire turn the page on that history it must not be allow to turn back
 there must also be progress away from the negotiate table violence have lessen but it have not disappear the leader of the four main church recently condemn the so call punishment beating and call for an end to such attack i add my voice to theirs
 as the church leader say this be a time when the utmost effort on all side be need to build a peaceful and confident community in the future but true peace require more than a treaty even more than the absence of violence those who have suffer most in the fighting must share fairly in the fruit of renewal the frustration that give rise to violence must give way to faith in the future
 the united states will help to secure the tangible benefit of peace ours be the first american administration ever to support in the congress the international fund for ireland which have become an engine for economic development and for reconciliation we will continue to encourage trade and investment and to help end the cycle of unemployment
 we be proud to support northern ireland you have give america a very great deal irish protestant and irish catholic together have add to america 's strength from our battle for independence down to the present day the irish have not only fight in our war they have build our nation and we owe you a very great debt
 let i say that of all the gift we can offer in return perhaps the most enduring and the most precious be the example of what be possible when people find unity and strength in their diversity we know from our own experience even today how hard that be to do after all we fight a great civil war over the issue of race and slavery in which hundred of thousand of our people be kill
 today in one of our county alone in los angeles there be over 150 different ethnic and racial group represent we know we can become strong if we bridge our difference but we learn in our own civil war that that have to begin with a change of the heart
 i grow up in the american south in one of the states that try to break from the american union my forebear on my father 's side be soldier in the confederate army i be read the other day a book about our first governor after the civil war who fight for the union army and who lose member of his own family they live the experience so many of you have live when this governor take office and look out over a sea of his fellow citizen who fight on the other side he say these word we have all do wrong no one can say his heart be altogether clean and his hand altogether pure thus as we wish to be forgive let we forgive those who have sin against we and our that be the beginning of america 's reconciliation and it must be the beginning of northern ireland 's reconciliation
 it be so much easy to believe that our difference matter more than what we have in common it be easy but it be wrong we all cherish family and faith work and community we all strive to live life that be free and honest and responsible we all want our child to grow up in a world where their talent be match by their opportunity and i believe those value be just as strong in county londonderry as they be in londonderry new hampshire in belfast northern ireland as in belfast maine
 i be proud to be of ulster scots stock i be proud to be also of irish stock i share these root with million and million of americans now over 40 million americans and we rejoice at thing be various as louis macneice once write it be one of the thing that make america special
 because our greatness flow from the wealth of our diversity as well as the strength of the ideal we share in common we feel bound to support other around the world who seek to bridge their own divide this be an important part of our country 's mission on the eve of the 21st century because we know that the chain of peace that protect we grow strong with every new link that be forge
 for the first time in half a century now we can put our child to bed at night know that the nuclear weapon of the former soviet union be no long point at those child in south africa the long night of apartheid have give way to a new freedom for all people in the middle east arabs and israelis be step beyond war to peace in an area where many believe peace would never come in haiti a brutal dictatorship have give way to a fragile new democracy in europe the dream of a stable undivided free continent seem finally within reach as the people of bosnia have the first real hope for peace since the terrible fighting begin there nearly 4 year ago
 the united states look forward to work with our ally here in europe and other to help the people in bosnia the muslims the croats the serbs to move beyond their division and their destruction to make the peace agreement they have make a reality in the life of their people
 those who work for peace have get to support one another we know that when leader stand up for peace they place their force on the line and sometimes their very life on the line as we learn so recently in the tragic murder of the brave prime minister of israel for just as peace have its pioneer peace will always have its rival even when child stand up and say what these child say today there will always be people who deep down inside will never be able to give up the past
 over the last 3 year i have have the privilege of meeting with and closely listen to both nationalists and unionists from northern ireland and i believe that the great struggle you face now be not between oppose idea or oppose interest the great struggle you face be between those who deep down inside be inclined to be peacemaker and those who deep down inside can not yet embrace the cause of peace between those who be in the ship of peace and those who be try to sink it old habit die hard there will always be those who define the worth of their life not by who they be but by who they be not not by what they be for but by what they be against they will never escape the dead end street of violence but you the vast majority protestant and catholic alike must not allow the ship of peace to sink on the rock of old habit and hard grudge
 you must stand firm against terror you must say to those who still would use violence for political objective you be the past your day be over violence have no place at the table of democracy and no role in the future of this land by the same token you must also be willing to say to those who renounce violence and who do take their own risk for peace that they be entitle to be full participant in the democratic process those who do show the courage to break with the past be entitle to their stake in the future
 as leader for peace become invest in the process as leader make compromise and risk the backlash people begin more and more i have see this all over the world they begin more and more to develop a common interest in each other 's success in stand together rather than stand apart they realize that the soon they get to true peace with all the reward it bring the soon it will be easy to discredit and destroy the force of destruction
 we will stand with those who take risk for peace in northern ireland and around the world i pledge that we will do all we can through the international fund for ireland and in many other way to ease your load if you walk down this path continually you will not walk alone we be enter an era of possibility unparallele in all of human history if you enter that era determine to build a new age of peace the united states of america will proudly stand with you
 but at the end of the day as with all free people your future be for you to decide your destiny be for you to determine only you can decide between division and unity between hard life and high hope only you can create a last peace it take courage to let go of familiar division it take faith to walk down a new road but when we see the bright gaze of these child we know the risk be worth the reward
 i have be so touch by the thousand of letter i have receive from schoolchildren here tell i what peace mean to they one young girl from ballymena wrote and i quote it be not easy to forgive and forget especially for those who have lose a family member or a close friend however if people could look to the future with hope instead of the past with fear we can only be move in the right direction i could not have say it nearly as well
 i believe you can summon the strength to keep move forward after all you have come so far already you have brave so many danger you have endure so many sacrifice surely there can be no turning back but peace must be wage with a warrior 's resolve bravely proudly and relentlessly secure in the knowledge of the single great difference between war and peace in peace everybody can win
 i be overcome today when i land in my plane and i drive with hillary up the highway to come here by the phenomenal beauty of the place and the spirit and the good will of the people northern ireland have a chance not only to begin anew but to be a real inspiration to the rest of the world a model of progress through tolerance
 let we join our effort together as never before to make that dream a reality let we join our prayer in this season of peace for a future of peace in this good land
 thank you very much

mr. speaker mr. vice president member of the 104th congress distinguished guest my fellow americans all across our land let i begin tonight by say to our man and woman in uniform around the world and especially those help peace take root in bosnia and to their family i thank you america be very very proud of you
 my duty tonight be to report on the state of the union not the state of our government but of our american community and to set forth our responsibility in the word of our founder to form a more perfect union
 the state of the union be strong our economy be the healthy it have be in three decade we have the low combine rate of unemployment and inflation in 27 year we have complete create nearly eight million new job over a million of they in basic industry like construction and automobile america be sell more car than japan for the first time since the 1970 and for three year in a row we have have a record number of new business start in our country
 our leadership in the world be also strong bring hope for new peace and perhaps most important we be gain ground in restore our fundamental value the crime rate the welfare and food stamp roll the poverty rate and the teen pregnancy rate be all down and as they go down prospect for america 's future go up
 we live in an age of possibility a hundred year ago we move from farm to factory now we move to an age of technology information and global competition these change have open vast new opportunity for our people but they have also present they with stiff challenge while more americans be live well too many of our fellow citizen be work hard just to keep up and they be rightly concerned about the security of their family
 we must answer here three fundamental question first how do we make the american dream of opportunity for all a reality for all americans who be willing to work for it second how do we preserve our old and endure value as we move into the future and third how do we meet these challenge together as one america
 we know big government do not have all the answer we know there be not a program for every problem we know and we have work to give the american people a small less bureaucratic government in washington and we have to give the american people one that live within its mean the era of big government be over but we can not go back to the time when our citizen be leave to fend for themselves
 instead we must go forward as one america one nation work together to meet the challenge we face together self reliance and teamwork be not oppose virtue we must have both i believe our new small government must work in an old fashioned american way together with all of our citizen through state and local government in the workplace in religious charitable and civic association our goal must be to enable all our people to make the most of their own life with strong family more educational opportunity economic security safe street a clean environment in a safe world
 to improve the state of our union we must ask more of ourselves we must expect more of each other and we must face our challenge together
 here in this place our responsibility begin with balance the budget in a way that be fair to all americans there be now broad bipartisan agreement that permanent deficit spending must come to an end
 i compliment the republican leadership and the membership for the energy and determination you have bring to this task of balance the budget and i thank the democrats for pass the large deficit reduction plan in history in 1993 which have already cut the deficit nearly in half in three year
 since 1993 we have all begin to see the benefit of deficit reduction low interest rate have make it easy for business to borrow and to invest and to create new job low interest rate have bring down the cost of home mortgage car payment and credit card rate to ordinary citizen now it be time to finish the job and balance the budget
 though difference remain among we which be significant the combine total of the propose saving that be common to both plan be more than enough use the number from your congressional budget office to balance the budget in seven year and to provide a modest tax cut
 these cut be real they will require sacrifice from everyone but these cut do not undermine our fundamental obligation to our parent our child and our future by endanger medicare or medicaid or education or the environment or by raise taxis on work family
 i have say before and let i say again many good idea have come out of our negotiation i have learn a lot about the way both republicans and democrats view the debate before we i have learn a lot about the good idea that each side have that we could all embrace
 we ought to resolve our remain difference i be willing to work to resolve they i be ready to meet tomorrow but i ask you to consider that we should at least enact these saving that both plan have in common and give the american people their balanced budget a tax cut low interest rate and a bright future we should do that now and make permanent deficit yesterday 's legacy
 now it be time for we to look also to the challenge of today and tomorrow beyond the burden of yesterday the challenge be significant but our nation be build on challenge america be build on challenge not promise and when we work together to meet they we never fail that be the key to a more perfect union our individual dream must be realize by our common effort
 tonight i want to speak to you about the challenge we all face as a people our first challenge be to cherish our child and strengthen america 's family family be the foundation of american life if we have strong family we will have a strong america
 before i go on i would like to take just a moment to thank my own family and to thank the person who have teach i more than anyone else over 25 year about the importance of family and child a wonderful wife a magnificent mother and a great first lady thank you hillary
 all strong family begin with take more responsibility for our child i have hear mrs. gore say that it be hard to be a parent today but it be even hard to be a child so all of we not just as parent but all of we in our other role our medium our school our teacher our community our church and synagogue our business our government all of we have a responsibility to help our child to make it and to make the most of their life and their god give capacity
 to the medium i say you should create movie and cd and television show you would want your own child and grandchild to enjoy
 i call on congress to pass the requirement for a v chip in tv set so that parent can screen out program they believe be inappropriate for their child when parent control what their young child see that be not censorship that be enable parent to assume more personal responsibility for their child 's upbringing and i urge they to do it the v chip requirement be part of the important telecommunication bill now pende in this congress it have bipartisan support and i urge you to pass it now
 to make the v chip work i challenge the broadcast industry to do what movie have do to identify your program in way that help parent to protect their child and i invite the leader of major medium corporation in the entertainment industry to come to the white house next month to work with we in a positive way on concrete way to improve what our child see on television i be ready to work with you
 i say to those who make and market cigarette every year a million child take up smoking even though it be against the law three hundred thousand of they will have their life shorten as a result our administration have take step to stop the massive marketing campaign that appeal to our child we be simply say market your product to adult if you wish but draw the line on child
 i say to those who be on welfare and especially to those who have be trap on welfare for a long time for too long our welfare system have undermine the value of family and work instead of support they the congress and i be near agreement on sweeping welfare reform we agree on time limit tough work requirement and the tough possible child support enforcement but i believe we must also provide child care so that mother who be require to go to work can do so without worry about what be happen to their child
 i challenge this congress to send i a bipartisan welfare reform bill that will really move people from welfare to work and do the right thing by our child i will sign it immediately
 let we be candid about this difficult problem pass a law even the good possible law be only a first step the next step be to make it work i challenge people on welfare to make the most of this opportunity for independence i challenge american business to give people on welfare the chance to move into the work force i applaud the work of religious group and other who care for the poor more than anyone else in our society they know the true difficulty of the task before we and they be in a position to help
 every one of we should join they that be the only way we can make real welfare reform a reality in the life of the american people
 to strengthen the family we must do everything we can to keep the teen pregnancy rate go down i be gratify as i be sure all americans be that it have drop for two year in a row but we all know it be still far too high
 tonight i be pleased to announce that a group of prominent americans be respond to that challenge by form an organization that will support grassroots community effort all across our country in a national campaign against teen pregnancy and i challenge all of we and every american to join their effort
 i call on american man and woman in family to give great respect to one another we must end the deadly scourge of domestic violence in our country and i challenge america 's family to work hard to stay together for family who stay together not only do well economically their child do well as well
 in particular i challenge the father of this country to love and care for their child if your family have separate you must pay your child support we be do more than ever to make sure you do and we be go to do more but let us all admit something about that too a check will not substitute for a parent 's love and guidance and only you only you can make the decision to help raise your child no matter who you be how low or high your station in life it be the most basic human duty of every american to do that job to the good of his or her ability
 our second challenge be to provide americans with the educational opportunity we will all need for this new century in our school every classroom in america must be connect to the information superhighway with computer and good software and well train teacher we be work with the telecommunications industry educator and parent to connect 20 percent of california 's classroom by this spring and every classroom and every library in the entire united states by the year 2000 i ask congress to support this education technology initiative so that we can make sure this national partnership succeed
 every diploma ought to mean something i challenge every community every school and every state to adopt national standard of excellence to measure whether school be meet those standard to cut bureaucratic red tape so that school and teacher have more flexibility for grassroots reform and to hold they accountable for result that be what our goal 2000 initiative be all about i challenge every state to give all parent the right to choose which public school their child will attend and to let teacher form new school with a charter they can keep only if they do a good job
 i challenge all our school to teach character education to teach good value and good citizenship and if it mean that teenager will stop kill each other over designer jacket then our public school should be able to require their student to wear school uniform
 i challenge our parent to become their child 's first teacher turn off the tv see that the homework be do and visit your child 's classroom no program no teacher no one else can do that for you
 my fellow americans high education be more important today than ever before we have create a new student loan program that be make it easy to borrow and repay those loan and we have dramatically cut the student loan default rate that be something we should all be proud of because it be unconscionably high just a few year ago
 through americorps our national service program this year 25,000 young people will earn college money by serve their local community to improve the life of their friend and neighbor
 these initiative be right for america and we should keep they go and we should also work hard to open the door of college even wide i challenge congress to expand work study and help one million young americans work their way through college by the year 2000 to provide a $ 1,000 merit scholarship for the top 5 percent of graduate in every high school in the united states to expand pell grant scholarship for deserving and needy student and to make up to $ 10,000 a year of college tuition tax deductible it be a good idea for america
 our third challenge be to help every american who be willing to work for it achieve economic security in this new age people who work hard still need support to get ahead in the new economy they need education and training for a lifetime they need more support for family raise child they need retirement security they need access to health care more and more americans be find that the education of their childhood simply do not last a lifetime
 so i challenge congress to consolidate 70 overlapping antiquated job training program into a simple voucher worth $ 2,600 for unemployed or underemployed worker to use as they please for community college tuition or other training this be a gi bill for america 's worker we should all be able to agree on
 more and more americans be work hard without a raise congress set the minimum wage within a year the minimum wage will fall to a 40 year low in purchase power four dollar and 25 cent an hour be no long a minimum wage but million of americans and their child be try to live on it i challenge you to raise their minimum wage
 in 1993 congress cut the taxis of 15 million hard press work family to make sure that no parent who work full time would have to raise their child in poverty and to encourage people to move from welfare to work this expand earn income tax credit be now worth about $ 1,800 a year to a family of four live on $ 20,000 the budget bill i veto would have reverse this achievement and raise taxis on nearly eight million of these people we should not do that we should not do that
 i also agree that the people who be help under this initiative be not all those in our country who be work hard to do a good job raise their child and at work i agree that we need a tax credit for work family with child that be one of the thing most of we in this chamber i hope can agree on i know it be strongly support by the republican majority and it should be part of any final budget agreement
 i want to challenge every business that can possibly afford it to provide pension for your employee and i challenge congress to pass a proposal recommend by the white house conference on small business that would make it easy for small business and farmer to establish their own pension plan that be something we should all agree on
 we should also protect exist pension plan two year ago with bipartisan support that be almost unanimous on both side of the aisle we move to protect the pension of eight million work people and to stabilize the pension of 32 million more congress should not now let company endanger those worker pension fund
 i know the proposal to liberalize the ability of employer to take money out of pension fund for other purpose would raise money for the treasury but i believe it be false economy i veto that proposal last year and i would have to do so again
 finally if our work family be go to succeed in the new economy they must be able to buy health insurance policy that they do not lose when they change job or when someone in their family get sick over the past two year over one million americans in work family have lose their health insurance we have to do more to make health care available to every american and congress should start by pass the bipartisan bill sponsor by senator kennedy and senator kassebaum that would require insurance company to stop drop people when they switch job and stop deny coverage for preexist condition let us all do that
 and even as we enact saving in these program we must have a common commitment to preserve the basic protection of medicare and medicaid not just to the poor but to people in work family include child people with disability people with aids senior citizen in nursing home
 in the past three year we have save $ 15 billion just by fight health care fraud and abuse we have all agree to save much more we have all agree to stabilize the medicare trust fund but we must not abandon our fundamental obligation to the people who need medicare and medicaid america can not become strong if they become weak
 the gi bill for worker tax relief for education and child rearing pension availability and protection access to health care preservation of medicare and medicaid these thing along with the family and medical leave act pass in 1993 these thing will help responsible hard work american family to make the most of their own life
 but employer and employee must do their part as well as they be do in so many of our fine company work together put the long term prosperity ahead of the short term gain as worker increase their hour and their productivity employer should make sure they get the skill they need and share the benefit of the good year as well as the burden of the bad one when company and worker work as a team they do well and so do america
 our fourth great challenge be to take our street back from crime and gang and drug at last we have begin to find a way to reduce crime form community partnership with local police force to catch criminal and prevent crime this strategy call community policing be clearly work violent crime be come down all across america in new york city murder be down 25 percent in st. louis 18 percent in seattle 32 percent but we still have a long way to go before our street be safe and our people be free from fear
 the crime bill of 1994 be critical to the success of community police it provide fund for 100,000 new police in community of all size we be already a third of the way there and i challenge the congress to finish the job let we stick with a strategy that be work and keep the crime rate come down
 community policing also require bond of trust between citizen and police i ask all americans to respect and support our law enforcement officer and to our police i say our child need you as role model and hero do not let they down
 the brady bill have already stop 44,000 people with criminal record from buy gun the assault weapon ban be keep 19 kind of assault weapon out of the hand of violent gang i challenge the congress to keep those law on the book
 our next step in the fight against crime be to take on gang the way we once take on the mob i be direct the fbi and other investigative agency to target gang that involve juvenile and violent crime and to seek authority to prosecute as adult teenager who maim and kill like adult
 and i challenge local housing authority and tenant association criminal gang member and drug dealer be destroy the life of decent tenant from now on the rule for resident who commit crime and pedal drug should be one strike and you be out
 i challenge every state to match federal policy to assure that serious violent criminal serve at least 85 percent of their sentence
 more police and punishment be important but they be not enough we have get to keep more of our young people out of trouble with prevention strategy not dictate by washington but develop in community i challenge all of our community all of our adult to give our child future to say yes to and i challenge congress not to abandon the crime bill 's support of these grassroots prevention effort
 finally to reduce crime and violence we have to reduce the drug problem the challenge begin in our home with parent talk to their child openly and firmly it embrace our church and synagogue our youth group and our school
 i challenge congress not to cut our support for drug free school people like the d.a.r.e. officer be make a real impression on grade schoolchildren that will give they the strength to say no when the time come
 meanwhile we continue our effort to cut the flow of drug into america for the last two year one man in particular have be on the front line of that effort tonight i be nominate he a hero of the persian gulf war and the commander in chief of the united states military southern command general barry mccaffrey as america 's new drug czar
 general mccaffrey have earn three purple hearts and two silver stars fight for this country tonight i ask that he lead our nation 's battle against drug at home and abroad to succeed he need a force far large than he have ever command before he need all of we every one of we have a role to play on this team
 thank you general mccaffrey for agree to serve your country one more time
 our fifth challenge to leave our environment safe and clean for the next generation because of a generation of bipartisan effort we do have clean water and air lead level in child 's blood have be cut by 70 percent toxic emission from factory cut in half lake erie be dead and now it be a thriving resource but 10 million child under 12 still live within four mile of a toxic waste dump a third of we breathe air that endanger our health and in too many community the water be not safe to drink we still have much to do
 yet congress have vote to cut environmental enforcement by 25 percent that mean more toxic chemical in our water more smog in our air more pesticide in our food lobbyist for polluter have be allow to write their own loophole into bill to weaken law that protect the health and safety of our child some say that the taxpayer should pick up the tab for toxic waste and let polluter who can afford to fix it off the hook i challenge congress to reexamine those policy and to reverse they
 this issue have not be a partisan issue the most significant environmental gain in the last 30 year be make under a democratic congress and president richard nixon we can work together we have to believe some basic thing do you believe we can expand the economy without hurt the environment i do do you believe we can create more job over the long run by clean the environment up i know we can that should be our commitment
 we must challenge business and community to take more initiative in protect the environment and we have to make it easy for they to do it to business this administration be say if you can find a cheap more efficient way than government regulation require to meet tough pollution standard do it as long as you do it right to community we say we must strengthen community right to know law require polluter to disclose their emission but you have to use the information to work with business to cut pollution people do have a right to know that their air and their water be safe

 our sixth challenge be to maintain america 's leadership in the fight for freedom and peace throughout the world because of american leadership more people than ever before live free and at peace and americans have know 50 year of prosperity and security
 we owe thank especially to our veteran of world war ii i would like to say to senator bob dole and to all other in this chamber who fight in world war ii and to all other on both side of the aisle who have fight bravely in all our conflict since i salute your service and so do the american people
 all over the world even after the cold war people still look to we and trust we to help they seek the blessing of peace and freedom but as the cold war fade into memory voice of isolation say america should retreat from its responsibility i say they be wrong
 the threat we face today as americans respect no nation 's border think of they terrorism the spread of weapon of mass destruction organized crime drug trafficking ethnic and religious hatred aggression by rogue state environmental degradation if we fail to address these threat today we will suffer the consequence in all our tomorrow
 of course we can not be everywhere of course we can not do everything but where our interest and our value be at stake and where we can make a difference america must lead we must not be isolationist we must not be the world 's policeman but we can and should be the world 's very good peacemaker
 by keep our military strong by use diplomacy where we can and force where we must by work with other to share the risk and the cost of our effort america be make a difference for people here and around the world for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age there be not a single russian missile point at america 's child
 north korea have now freeze its dangerous nuclear weapon program in haiti the dictator be go democracy have a new day the flow of desperate refugee to our shore have subside through tough trade deal for america over 80 of they we have open market abroad and now export be at an all time high grow fast than import and create good american job
 we stand with those take risk for peace in northern ireland where catholic and protestant child now tell their parent violence must never return in the middle east where arabs and jews who once seem destine to fight forever now share knowledge and resource and even dream
 and we stand up for peace in bosnia remember the skeletal prisoner the mass grave the campaign to rape and torture the endless line of refugee the threat of a spread war all these threat all these horror have now begin to give way to the promise of peace now our troop and a strong nato together with our new partner from central europe and elsewhere be help that peace to take hold
 as all of you know i be just there with a bipartisan congressional group and i be so proud not only of what our troop be do but of the pride they evidence in what they be do they know what america 's mission in this world be and they be proud to be carry it out
 through these effort we have enhance the security of the american people but make no mistake about it important challenge remain

 my fellow americans the six challenge i have just discuss be for all of we our seventh challenge be really america 's challenge to those of we in this hallowed hall tonight to reinvent our government and make our democracy work for they

 our administration be work hard to give the american people a government that work well and cost less thank to the work of vice president gore we be eliminate 16,000 page of unnecessary rule and regulation shift more decisionmake out of washington back to state and local community
 as we move into the era of balanced budget and small government we must work in new way to enable people to make the most of their own life we be help america 's community not with more bureaucracy but with more opportunity through our successful empowerment zone and community development bank we be help people to find job to start business and with tax incentive for company that clean up abandon industrial property we can bring job back to place that desperately desperately need they
 but there be some area that the federal government should not leave and should address and address strongly one of these area be the problem of illegal immigration after year of neglect this administration have take a strong stand to stiffen the protection of our border we be increase border control by 50 percent we be increase inspection to prevent the hiring of illegal immigrant and tonight i announce i will sign an executive order to deny federal contract to business that hire illegal immigrant
 let i be very clear about this we be still a nation of immigrant we should be proud of it we should honor every legal immigrant here work hard to be a good citizen work hard to become a new citizen but we be also a nation of law
 i want to say a special word now to those who work for our federal government today the federal work force be 200,000 employee small than it be the day i take office as president our federal government today be the small it have be in 30 year and it be get small every day most of our fellow americans probably do not know that and there be a good reason a good reason the remain federal work force be compose of hard work americans who be now work hard and work smarter than ever before to make sure the quality of our service do not decline
 i would like to give you one example his name be richard dean he be a 49 year old vietnam veteran who be work for the social security administration for 22 year now last year he be hard at work in the federal building in oklahoma city when the blast kill 169 people and bring the rubble down all around he he reentere that build four time he save the life of three woman he be here with we this evening and i want to recognize richard and applaud both his public service and his extraordinary personal heroism but richard dean 's story do not end there this last november he be force out of his office when the government shut down and the second time the government shut down he continue help social security recipient but he be work without pay
 on behalf of richard dean and his family and all the other people who be out there work every day do a good job for the american people i challenge all of you in this chamber let us never ever shut the federal government down again
 on behalf of all americans especially those who need their social security payment at the beginning of march i also challenge the congress to preserve the full faith and credit of the united states to honor the obligation of this great nation as we have for 220 year to rise above partisanship and pass a straightforward extension of the debt limit and show people america keep its word
 i know that this evening i have ask a lot of congress and even more from america but i be confident when americans work together in their home their school their church their synagogue their civic group their workplace they can meet any challenge
 i say again the era of big government be over but we can not go back to the era of fending for yourself we have to go forward to the era of work together as a community as a team as one america with all of we reach across these line that divide we the division the discrimination the rancor we have to reach across it to find common ground we have get to work together if we want america to work
 i want you to meet two more people tonight who do just that lucius wright be a teacher in the jackson mississippi public school system a vietnam veteran he have create group to help inner city child turn away from gang and build future they can believe in sergeant jennifer rodgers be a police officer in oklahoma city like richard dean she help to pull her fellow citizen out of the rubble and deal with that awful tragedy she remind we that in their response to that atrocity the people of oklahoma city lift all of we with their basic sense of decency and community
 lucius wright and jennifer rodgers be special americans and i have the honor to announce tonight that they be the very first of several thousand americans who will be choose to carry the olympic torch on its long journey from los angeles to the centennial of the modern olympics in atlanta this summer not because they be star athlete but because they be star citizen community hero meet america 's challenge they be our real champion
 please stand up applause
 now each of we must hold high the torch of citizenship in our own life none of we can finish the race alone we can only achieve our destiny together one hand one generation one american connect to another
 there have always be thing we could do together dream we could make real which we could never have do on our own we americans have forge our identity our very union from the very point of view that we can accommodate every point on the planet every different opinion but we must be bind together by a faith more powerful than any doctrine that divide we by our belief in progress our love of liberty and our relentless search for common ground
 america have always seek and always rise to every challenge who would say that having come so far together we will not go forward from here who would say that this age of possibility be not for all americans
 our country be and always have be a great and good nation but the good be yet to come if we all do our part
 thank you god bless you and god bless the united states of america thank you

good morning lady and gentleman and let i thank you all for be here thank you senator kyl and senator feinstein for your ground break work here thank you senator exon my longtime friend senator heflin thank you congressman frost congressman stupak congressman orton
 i thank all the representative here of the victim community the law enforcement community i thank the attorney general and john schmidt and aileen adams and bonnie campbell for do such a fine job at the justice department on all criminal justice issue i thank the vice president and especially i want to thank roberta roper and the other member of the national movement for victim advocacy mr. roper thank you for come thank you john and pat byron thank you mark klaas and thank you pam mcclain and especially john walsh thank you for spend all of these year to bring these issue to america 's attention thank you sir
 i would also like to say a special word of thank to the person who do more than any other person in the united states to talk i through all the legal and practical matter that have to be resolve in order for the president to advocate amend our constitution former prosecutor and a former colleague of mine governor bob miller of nevada thank you sir for your work here
 for year we have work to make our criminal justice system more effective more fair more even hand more vigilant in the protection of the innocent today the system bend over backwards to protect those who may be innocent and that be as it should be but it too often ignore the million and million of people who be completely innocent because they be victim and that be wrong that be what we be try to correct today
 when someone be a victim he or she should be at the center of the criminal justice process not on the outside look in participation in all form of government be the essence of democracy victim should be guarantee the right to participate in proceeding relate to crime commit against they people accuse of crime have explicit constitutional right ordinary citizen have a constitutional right to participate in criminal trial by serve on a jury the press have a constitutional right to attend trial all of this be as it should be it be only the victim of crime who have no constitutional right to participate and that be not the way it should be
 having carefully study all the alternative i be now convinced that the only way to fully safeguard the right of victim in america be to amend our constitution and guarantee these basic right to be tell about public court proceeding and to attend they to make a statement to the court about bail about sentencing about accept a plea if the victim be present to be tell about parole hearing to attend and to speak notice when the defendant or convict escape or be release restitution from the defendant reasonable protection from the defendant and notice of these right
 if you have ever be a victim of a violent crime it probably would not even occur to you that these right could be deny if you have never be a victim but actually it happen time and time again it happen in spite of the fact that the victim right movement in america have be an active force for about 20 year now
 the wife of a murder state trooper in maryland be leave cry outside the courtroom for the entire trial of her husband 's killer because the defense subpoena she as a witness just to keep she out and never even call she a rape victim in florida be not notify when her rapist be release on parole he find she and kill she
 last year in new jersey 8 year old jakiyah mcclain be sexually assault and brutally murder she have go to visit a friend and never come home police find she in the closet of an abandon apartment now her mother want to use a new jersey law that give the murder victim survivor the right to address a jury decide on the death penalty she want the jury to know more about this fine young girl than the crime scene report she want they to know that jakiyah be accept into a school for gifted child the day before she die but a new jersey judge decide she can not testify even though the state law give she the right to do so he rule that the defendant 's constitutional right to a fair trial require he to strike the law down
 well jakiyah 's mother have the courage to overcome her pain to be with we today we have to change this for she and for other victim in america thank you and god bless you
 the only way to give victim equal and due consideration be to amend the constitution for nearly 20 year i have be involve in the fight for victim right since i be attorney general in my home state we pass law then to guarantee victim right to attend trial and to get restitution and later to get notice and to participate in parole hearing over all those year i learn what every victim of crime know too well as long as the right of the accuse be protect but the right of victim be not time and again the victim will lose
 when a judge balance defendant right in the federal constitution against victim right in a statute or a state constitution the defendant right almost always prevail that be just how the law work today we want to level the playing field this be not about deprive people accuse of crime of their legitimate right include the presumption of innocence this be about simple fairness when a judge balance the right of the accuse and the right of the victim we want the right of the victim to get equal weight when a plea bargain be enter in public a criminal be sentence a defendant be let out on bail the victim ought to know about it and ought to have a say
 i want to work with the congressional leadership the house and senate judiciary committees include senators kyl and feinstein and chairman hyde and law enforcement official to craft the good possible amendment it should guarantee victim right in every court in the land federal state juvenile and military it should be self execute so that it take effect as soon as it be ratify without additional legislation congress will take responsibility to enforce victim right in federal court and the states will keep responsibility to enforce they in state court but we need the amendment
 i also want to say just before i go forward again i want to thank senators kyl and feinstein and the other who have approach this in a totally bipartisan manner this be a cause for all americans when people be victimize the criminal almost never ask before you be rob or beat or rape or murder be you a republican or a democrat this be a matter of national security just as much as the national security issue beyond our border on which we try to achieve a bipartisan consensus and i applaud the nonpolitical and patriotic way in which this manner have be approach in the congress just like it be approach every day in the country and we ought to do our good to keep it that way
 we know that there can be with any good effort unforeseen consequence we think we know what they would likely be and we believe we know how to guard against they we certainly do not want to make it hard for prosecutor to convict violent criminal
 we sure do not want to give criminal like gang member who may be victim of their associate any way to take advantage of these right just to slow the criminal justice process down
 we want to protect victim not accidentally help criminal but we can solve these problem the problem be not an excuse for inaction we still have to go forward
 of course amend the constitution can take a long time it may take year and while we work to amend it we must do everything in our power to enhance the protection of victim right now today i be direct the attorney general to hold the federal system to a high standard than ever before to guarantee maximum participation by victim under exist law and to review exist legislation to see what further change we ought to make
 i will give you an example there ought to be i believe in every law federal and state a protection for victim who participate in the criminal justice process not to be discriminate against on the job because they have to take time off that protection today be accord to jury member it certainly ought to extend to people who be victim who need to be in the criminal justice process and we should not wait for that kind of thing to be do
 i want investigator and prosecutor to take the strong step to include victim i want work to begin immediately to launch a computerized system so victim get information about new development in a case in change in the status or the location of a defendant or a convict
 i do not support amend the constitution lightly it be sacred it should be change only with great caution and after much consideration but i reject the idea that it should never be change change it lightly and you risk its distinction but never change it and you risk its vitality
 i have support the goal of many constitutional amendment since i take office but in each amendment that have be propose during my tenure as president i have oppose the amendment either because it be not appropriate or not necessary but this be different i want to balance the budget for example but the constitution already give we the power to do that what we need be the will and to work together to do that i want young people to be able to express their religious conviction in an appropriate manner wherever they be even in a school but the constitution protect people 's right to express their faith
 but this be different this be not an attempt to put legislative responsibility in the constitution or to guarantee a right that be already guarantee amend the constitution here be simply the only way to guarantee that victim right be weight equally with defendant right in every courtroom in america
 two hundred twenty year ago our founding fathers be concern justifiably that government never never trample on the right of people just because they be accuse of a crime today it be time for we to make sure that while we continue to protect the right of the accuse government do not trample on the right of the victim
 until these right be also enshrine in our constitution the people who have be hurt most by crime will continue to be deny equal justice under law that be what this country be really all about equal justice under law and crime victim deserve that as much as any group of citizen in the united states ever will
 thank you god bless you and god bless america

 our country be still the strong force for peace and freedom on earth on issue that once before tear we apart we have change the old politic of washington for too long leader in washington ask who be to blame but we ask what be we go to do

 on crime we be put 100,000 police on the street we make three strike and you be out the law of the land we stop 60,000 felon fugitive and stalker from get handgun under the brady bill we ban assault rifle we support tough punishment and prevention program to keep our child from drug and gang and violence four year now for four year now the crime rate in america have go down

 on welfare we work with states to launch a quiet revolution today there be 1.8 million few people on welfare than there be the day i take the oath of office we be move people from welfare to work

 we have increase child support collection by 40 percent the federal work force be the small it have be since john kennedy and the deficit have come down for four year in a row for the first time since before the civil war down 60 percent on the way to zero we will do it

 we be on the right track to the 21st century we be on the right track but our work be not finish what should we do first let we consider how to proceed again i say the question be no long who be to blame but what to do

 i believe that bob dole and jack kemp and ross perot love our country and they have work hard to serve it it be legitimate even necessary to compare our record with theirs our proposal for the future with theirs and i expect they to make a vigorous effort to do the same but i will not attack i will not attack they personally or permit other to do it in this party if i can prevent it my fellow americans this must be this must be a campaign of idea not a campaign of insult the american people deserve it

 now here be the main idea i love and revere the rich and proud history of america and i be determined to take our good tradition into the future but with all respect we do not need to build a bridge to the past we need to build a bridge to the future and that be what i commit to you to do

 so tonight tonight let we resolve to build that bridge to the 21st century to meet our challenge and protect our value let we build a bridge to help our parent raise their child to help young people and adult to get the education and training they need to make our street safe to help americans succeed at home and at work to break the cycle of poverty and dependence to protect our environment for generation to come and to maintain our world leadership for peace and freedom let we resolve to build that bridge

 tonight my fellow americans i ask all of our fellow citizen to join i and to join you in build that bridge to the 21st century four year from now just four year from now think of it we begin a new century full of enormous possibility we have to give the american people the tool they need to make the most of their god give potential we must make the basic bargain of opportunity and responsibility available to all americans not just a few that be the promise of the democratic party that be the promise of america

 i want to build a bridge to the 21st century in which we expand opportunity through education where computer be as much a part of the classroom as blackboard where highly train teacher demand peak performance from our student where every 8 year old can point to a book and say i can read it myself

 by the year 2000 the single most critical thing we can do be to give every single american who want it the chance to go to college we must make two year of college just as universal in four year as a high school education be today and we can do it we can do it and we should cut taxis to do it

 i propose a $ 1,500 a year tuition tax credit for americans a hope scholarship for the first two year of college to make the typical community college education available to every american i believe every work family ought also to be able to deduct up to $ 10,000 in college tuition cost per year for education after that i believe the family of this country ought to be able to save money for college in a tax free ira save it year in and year out withdraw it for college education without penalty we should not tax middle income americans for the money they spend on college we will get the money back down the road many time over

 i want to say here before i go far that these tax cut and every other one i mention tonight be all fully pay for in my balanced budget plan line by line dime by dime and they focus on education

 now one thing so many of our fellow americans be learn be that education no long stop on graduation day i have propose a new gi bill for american worker a $ 2,600 grant for unemployed and underemployed americans so that they can get the training and the skill they need to go back to work at well pay job good high skilled job for a good future

 but we must demand excellence at every level of education we must insist that our student learn the old basic we learn and the new basic they have to know for the next century tonight let we set a clear national goal all child should be able to read on their own by the third grade when 40 percent of our 8 year old can not read as well as they should we have to do something i want to send 30,000 reading specialist and national service corp member to mobilize a voluntary army of one million read tutor for third grader all across america they will teach our young child to read

 let i say to our parent you have to lead the way every tired night you spend read a book to your child will be worth it many time over i know that hillary and i still talk about the book we read to chelsea when we be so tired we could hardly stay awake we still remember they and more important so do she but we be go to help the parent of this country make every child able to read for himself or herself by the age of 8 by the third grade do you believe we can do that applause will you help we do that applause

 we must give parent all parent the right to choose which public school their child will attend and to let teacher form new charter school with a charter they can keep only if they do a good job we must keep our school open late so that young people have someplace to go and something to say yes to and stay off the street

 we must require that our student pass tough test to keep move up in school a diploma have to mean something when they get out we should reward teacher that be do a good job remove those who do not measure up but in every case never forget that none of we would be here tonight if it be not for our teacher i know i would not we ought to lift they up not tear they down

 we need school that will take our child into the next century we need school that be rebuild and modernize with an unprecedented commitment from the national government to increase school construction and with every single library and classroom in america connect to the information superhighway by the year 2000

 now folk if we do these thing every 8 year old will be able to read every 12 year old will be able to log in on the internet every 18 year old will be able to go to college and all americans will have the knowledge they need to cross that bridge to the 21st century

 i want to build a bridge to the 21st century in which we create a strong and grow economy to preserve the legacy of opportunity for the next generation by balance our budget in a way that protect our value and ensure that every family will be able to own and protect the value of their most important asset their home

 tonight let we proclaim to the american people we will balance the budget and let we also proclaim we will do it in a way that preserve medicare medicaid education the environment the integrity of our pension the strength of our people

 now last year when the republican congress send i a budget that violate those value and principle i veto it and i would do it again tomorrow i could never allow cut that devastate education for our child that pollute our environment that end the guarantee of health care for those who be serve under medicaid that end our duty or violate our duty to our parent through medicare i just could not do that as long as i be president i will never let it happen and it do not matter if they try again as they do before to use the blackmail threat of a shutdown of the federal government to force these thing on the american people we do not let it happen before we will not let it happen again

 of course there be a well answer to this dilemma we could have the right kind of balanced budget with a new congress a democratic congress

 i want to balance the budget with real cut in government in waste i want a plan that invest in education as mine do in technology and yes in research as christopher reeve so powerfully remind we we must do

 and my plan give americans tax cut that will help our economy to grow i want to expand ira so that young people can save tax free to buy a first home tonight i propose a new tax cut for home ownership that say to every middle income work family in this country if you sell your home you will not have to pay a capital gain tax on it ever not ever i want every american to be able to hear those beautiful word welcome home

 let i say again every tax cut i call for tonight be target it be responsible and it be pay for within my balanced budget plan my tax cut will not undermine our economy they will speed economic growth

 we should cut taxis for the family send a child to college for the worker return to college for the family save to buy a home or for long term health care and a $ 500 per child credit for middle income family raise their child who need help with child care and what the child will do after school that be the right way to cut taxis pro family pro education pro economic growth

 now our opponent have put forward a very different plan a risky $ 550 billion tax scheme that will force they to ask for even big cut in medicare medicaid education and the environment than they pass and i veto last year but even then they will not cover the cost of their scheme so that even then this plan will explode the deficit which will increase interest rate by two percent accord to their own estimate last year it will require huge cut in the very investment we need to grow and to grow together and at the same time slow down the economy

 you know what high interest rate mean to you it mean a high mortgage payment a high car payment a high credit card payment to our economy it mean business people will not borrow as much money invest as much money create as many new job create as much wealth raise as many wage do we really want to make that same mistake all over again

 audience no o o

 president clinton do we really want to stop economic growth again

 audience no o o

 president clinton   do we really want to start pile up another mountain of debt

 audience no o o

 president clinton do we want to bring back the recession of 1991 and 92

 audience no o o

 president clinton do we want to weaken our bridge to the 21st century

 audience no o o

 president clinton of course we do not we have an obligation you and i to leave our child a legacy of opportunity not a legacy of debt our budget would be balance today we would have a surplus today if we do not have to make the interest payment on the debt run up in the 12 year before the clinton gore administration take office

 audience four more year four more year four more year

 president clinton so let i say this be one of those area in which i respectfully disagree with my opponent i do not believe we should bet the farm and i certainly do not believe we should bet the country we should stay on the right track to the 21st century

 opportunity alone be not enough i want to build an america in the 21st century in which all americans take personal responsibility for themselves their family their community and their country i want our nation to take responsibility to make sure that every single child can look out the window in the morning and see a whole community get up and go to work

 we want these young people to know the thrill of the first paycheck the challenge of start that first business the pride in follow in a parent 's footstep the welfare reform law i sign last week give america a chance but not a guarantee to have that kind of new beginning to have a new social bargain with the poor guarantee health care child care and nutrition for the child but require able bodied parent to work for the income

 now i say to all of you whether you support the law or oppose it but especially to those who support it we have a responsibility we have a moral obligation to make sure the people who be be require to work have the opportunity to work we must make sure the job be there there should be one million new job for welfare recipient by the year 2000 state under this law can now take the money that be spend on the welfare check and use it to help business provide paycheck i challenge every state to do it soon

 i propose also to give business a tax credit for every person hire off welfare and keep employ i propose to offer private job placement firm a bonus for every welfare recipient they place in a job who stay in it and more important i want to help community put welfare recipient to work right now without delay repair school make their neighborhood clean and safe make they shine again there be lot of work to be do out there our city can find way to put people to work and bring dignity and strength back to these family

 my fellow americans i have spend an enormous amount of time with our dear friend the late ron brown and with secretary kantor and other open market for america around the world and i be proud of every one we open but let we never forget the great untapped market for american enterprise be right here in america in the inner city in the rural area who have not feel this recovery with investment and business and job they can become our partner in the future and it be a great opportunity we ought not to pass up

 i propose more empowerment zone like the one we have right here in chicago to draw business into poor neighborhood i propose more community development bank like the south shore bank right here in chicago to help people in those neighborhood start their own small business more job more income new market for america right here at home make welfare reform a reality applause

 now folk you cheer and i thank you but the government can only do so much the private sector have to provide most of these job so i want to say again tonight i challenge every business person in america who have ever complain about the failure of the welfare system to try to hire somebody off welfare and try hard applause thank you after all the welfare system you use to complain about be not here anymore there be no more who be to blame on welfare now the only question be what to do and we all have a responsibility especially those who have criticize what be pass and who have ask for a change and who have the ability to give poor people a chance to grow and support their family i want to build a bridge to the 21st century that end the permanent under class that lift up the poor and end their isolation their exile and they be not forget anymore applause thank you

 audience four more year four more year four more year

 president clinton i want to build a bridge to the 21st century where our child be not kill other child anymore where child 's life be not shatter by violence at home or in the schoolyard where a generation of young people be not leave to raise themselves on the street

 with more police and punishment and prevention the crime rate have drop for four year in a row now but we can not rest because we know it be still too high we can not rest until crime be a shocking exception to our daily life not news as usual will you stay with i until we reach that good day applause

 my fellow americans we all owe a great debt to sarah and jim brady and i be glad they take their wrong turn and wound up in chicago i be glad to see that it be to they we owe the good news that 60,000 felon fugitive and stalker could not get handgun because of the brady bill but not a single hunter in arkansas or new hampshire or illinois or anyplace else miss a hunting season

 but now i say we should extend the brady bill because anyone who have commit an act of domestic violence against a spouse or a child should not buy a gun and we must ban those cop killer bullet they be design for one reason only to kill police officer we ask the police to keep we safe we owe it to they to help keep they safe while they do their job for we

 we should pass a victim 's right constitutional amendment because victim deserve to be hear they need to know when an assailant be release they need to know these thing and the only way to guarantee they be through a constitutional amendment

 we have make a great deal of progress even the crime rate among young people be finally come down so it be very very painful to i that drug use among young people be up drug nearly kill my brother when he be a young man and i hate they he fight back he be here tonight with his wife his little boy be here and i be really proud of he but i learn something i learn something in go through that long nightmare with our family and i can tell you something have happen to some of our young people they simply do not think these drug be dangerous anymore or they think the risk be acceptable so begin with our parent and without regard to our party we have to renew our energy to teach this generation of young people the hard cold truth drug be deadly drug be wrong drug can cost you your life

 general barry mccaffrey the four star general who lead our fight against drug in latin america now lead our crusade against drug at home stop more drug at our border crack down on those who sell they and most important of all pursue a national antidrug strategy whose primary aim be to turn our child away from drug i call on congress to give he every cent of funding we have request for this strategy and to do it now

 there be more we will do we should say to parolee we will test you for drug if you go back on they we will send you back to jail we will say to gang we will break you with the same antiracketeering law we use to put mob boss in jail you be not go to kill our kid anymore or turn they into murderer before they be teenager

 my fellow americans if we be go to build that bridge to the 21st century we have to make our child free free of the vise grip of gun and gang and drug free to build life of hope

 i want to build a bridge to the 21st century with a strong american community begin with strong family an america where all child be cherish and protect from destructive force where parent can succeed at home and at work everywhere i have go in america people come up and talk to i about their struggle with the demand of work and their desire to do a well job with their child the very first person i ever see fight that battle be here with i four year ago and tonight i miss she very very much my irrepressible hard work always optimistic mother do the good she could for her brother and i often against very stiff odd i learn from she just how much love and determination can overcome but from she and from our life i also learn that no parent can do it alone and no parent should have to she have the kind of help every parent deserve from our neighbor our friend our teacher our pastor our doctor and so many more

 you know when i start out in public life with a lot of my friend from the arkansas delegation down here there use to be a saying from time to time that every man who run for public office will claim that he be bear in a log cabin he build with his own hand laughter well my mother know well and she make sure i do too long before she even meet hillary my mother know it take a village and she be grateful for the support she get

 as tipper gore and hillary say on tuesday we have all of we in our administration work hard to support family in raise their child and succeed at work but we must do more we should extend the family and medical leave law to give parent some time off to take their child to regular doctor 's appointment or attend those parent teacher conference at school that be a key determination of their success we should pass a flextime law that allow employee to take their overtime pay in money or in time off depend on what be well for their family

 the fda have adopt new measure to reduce advertising and sale of cigarette to child the vice president speak so movingly of it last night but let i remind you my fellow americans that be very much an issue in this election because that battle be far from over and the two candidate have different view i pledge to america 's parent that i will see this effort all the way through

 work with the entertainment industry we be give parent the v chip tv show be be rate for content so parent will be able to make a judgment about whether their small child should see they and three hour of quality child 's programming every week on every network be on the way

 the kennedy kassebaum law say every american can keep his or her health insurance if they have to change job even if someone in their family have be sick that be a very important thing but tonight we should spell out the next step the first thing we ought to do be to extend the benefit of health care to people who be unemployed i propose in my balanced budget plan pay for to help unemployed family keep their health insurance for up to six month a parent may be without a job but no child should be without a doctor and let i say again as the first lady do on tuesday we should protect mother and newborn baby from be force out of the hospital in less than 48 hour

 we respect the individual conscience of every american on the painful issue of abortion but believe as a matter of law that this decision should be leave to a woman her conscience her doctor and her god abortion should not only be safe and legal it should be rare that be why i help to establish and support a national effort to reduce out of wedlock teen pregnancy and that be why we must promote adoption

 last week the minimum wage bill i sign contain a $ 5,000 credit to family who adopt child even more if the child have disability it put an end to racial discrimination in the adoption process it be a good thing for america my fellow americans already there be ten of thousand of child out there who need a good home with love parent i hope more of they will find it now

 i want to build a bridge to the 21st century with a clean and safe environment we be make our food safe from pesticide we be protect our drinking water and our air from poison we save yellowstone from mining we establish the large national park south of alaska in the mojave desert in california we be work to save the precious florida everglades and when the leader of this congress invite the polluter into the back room to roll back 25 year of environmental protection that both party have always support i say no

 but we must do more today 10 million child live within just four mile of a toxic waste dump we have clean up 197 of those dump in the last three year more than in the previous 12 year combine in the next four year we propose to clean up 500 more two third of all that be leave and the most dangerous one our child should grow up next to park not poison

 we should make it a crime even to attempt to pollute we should freeze the serious polluter 's property until they clean up the problem they create we should make it easy for family to find out about toxic chemical in their neighborhood so they can do more to protect their own child these be the thing that we must do to build that bridge to the 21st century

 my fellow americans i want to build a bridge to the 21st century that make sure we be still the nation with the world 's strong defense that our foreign policy still advance the value of our american community in the community of nation our bridge to the future must include bridge to other nation because we remain the world 's indispensable nation to advance prosperity peace and freedom and to keep our own child safe from the danger of terror and weapon of mass destruction

 we have help to bring democracy to haiti and peace to bosnia now the peace sign on the white house lawn between the israelis and the palestinians must embrace more of israel 's neighbor the deep desire for peace that hillary and i feel when we walk the street of belfast and derry must become real for all the people of northern ireland and cuba must finally join the community of democracy

 nothing in our lifetime have be more heartening than when people of the former soviet union and central europe break the grip of communism we have aid their progress and i be proud of it and i will continue our strong partnership with a democratic russia and we will bring some of central europe 's new democracy into nato so that they will never question their own freedom in the future

 our american export be at record level in the next four year we have to break down even more barrier to they reach out to latin america to africa to other country in asia make sure that our worker and our product the world 's fine have the benefit of free and fair trade

 in the last four year we have freeze north korea 's nuclear weapon program and i be proud to say that tonight there be not a single russian nuclear missile point at an american child now we must enforce and ratify without delay measure that far reduce nuclear arsenal banish poison gas and ban nuclear test once and for all

 we have make investment new investment in our most important defense asset our magnificent man and woman in uniform by the year 2000 we also will have increase funding to modernize our weapon system by 40 percent these commitment will make sure that our military remain the well train well equip fighting force in the entire world

 we be develop a sensible national missile defense but we must not not now not by the year 2000 squander $ 60 billion on an unproved ineffective star wars program that could be obsolete tomorrow

 we be fight terrorism on all front with a three pronged strategy first we be work to rally a world coalition with zero tolerance for terrorism just this month i sign a law impose harsh sanction on foreign company that invest in key sector of the iranian and libyan economy as long as iran train support and protect terrorist as long as libya refuse to give up the people who blow up pan am 103 they will pay a price from the united states

 second we must give law enforcement the tool they need to take the fight to terrorist we need new law to crack down on money laundering and to prosecute and punish those who commit violent act against american citizen abroad to add chemical marker or taggant to gunpowder use in bomb so we can crack the bombmaker to extend the same power police now have against organized crime to save life by tap all the phone that terrorist use terrorist be as big a threat to our future perhaps big than organized crime why should we have two different standard for a common threat to the safety of america and our child we need in short the law that congress refuse to pass and i ask they again please as an american not a partisan matter pass these law now

 third we will improve airport and air travel security i have ask the vice president to establish a commission and report back to i on way to do this but now we will install the most sophisticated bomb detection equipment in all our major airport we will search every airplane fly to or from america from another nation every flight every cargo hold every cabin every time

 my fellow democrats and my fellow americans i know that in most election season foreign policy be not a matter of great interest in the debate in the barbershop and the cafe of america on the plant floor and at the bowling alley but there be time there be time when only america can make the difference between war and peace between freedom and repression between life and death we can not save all the world 's child but we can save many of they we can not become the world 's policeman but where our value and our interest be at stake and where we can make a difference we must act and we must lead that be our job and we be well strong and safe because we be do it

 my fellow americans let i say one last time we can only build our bridge to the 21st century if we build it together and if we be willing to walk arm in arm across that bridge together i have spend so much of your time that you give i these last four year to be your president worry about the problem of bosnia the middle east northern ireland rwanda burundi what do these place have in common people be kill each other and butcher child because they be different from one another they share the same piece of land but they be different from one another they hate their race their tribe their ethnic group their religion

 we have see the terrible terrible price that people pay when they insist on fight and kill their neighbor over their difference in our own country we have see america pay a terrible price for any form of discrimination and we have see we grow strong as we have steadily let more and more of our hatred and our fear go as we have give more and more of our people the chance to live their dream

 that be why the flame of our statue of liberty like the olympic flame carry all across america by thousand of citizen hero will always always burn brighter than the fire that burn our church our synagogue our mosque always

 look around this hall tonight and to our fellow americans watch on television you look around this hall tonight there be every conceivable difference here among the people who be gather if we want to build that bridge to the 21st century we have to be willing to say loud and clear if you believe in the value of the constitution the bill of rights the declaration of independence if you be willing to work hard and play by the rule you be part of our family and we be proud to be with you applause you cheer now because you know this be true you know this be true when you walk out of this hall think about it live by it

 we still have too many americans who give in to their fear of those who be different from they not so long ago swastikas be paint on the door of some african american member of our special forces at fort bragg folk for those of you who do not know what they do the special forces be just what the name say they be special force if i walk off this stage tonight and call they on the telephone and tell they to go halfway around the world and risk their life for you and be there by tomorrow at noon they will do it they do not deserve to have swastikas on their door

 so look around here look around here old or young healthy as a horse or a person with a disability that have not keep you down man or woman native american native bear immigrant straight or gay whatever the test ought to be i believe in the constitution the bill of rights and the declaration of independence i believe in religious liberty i believe in freedom of speech i believe in work hard and play by the rule i be show up for work tomorrow i be build that bridge to the 21st century that ought to be the test

 my fellow americans 68 night from tonight the american people will face once again a critical moment of decision we be go to choose the last president of the 20th century and the first president of the 21st century but the real choice be not that the real choice be whether we will build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past about whether we believe our good day be still out there or our good day be behind we about whether we want a country of people all work together or one where you be on your own

 let we commit ourselves this night to rise up and build the bridge we know we ought to build all the way to the 21st century let we have faith american faith that we be not leave our greatness behind we be go to carry it right on with we into that new century a century of new challenge and unlimited promise let we in short do the work that be before we so that when our time here be over we will all watch the sun go down as we all must and say truly we have prepare our child for the dawn

 my fellow americans after these four good hard year i still believe in a place call hope a place call america

 lehrer senator dole two minute

 senator bob dole thank you

 thank you mr. president for those kind word and i thank the people of hartford the commission and all those out here who may be listen or watch it ’ a great honor for i to be here stand here as the republican nominee i ’m very proud to be the republican nominee reach out to democrats and independents

 i have three very special people with i my wife elizabeth my daughter robin who have never let i down and a fellow name frank carafa from new york who along with ollie manninen help i out in the mountain of italy a few year back i ’ve learn from they that people do have tough time and sometimes you can not go it alone and that ’ what america ’ all about

 i remember get my future back from doctor and nurse and a doctor in chicago name dr. kelikian and ever since that time i ’ve try to give something back to my country to the people who be watch we tonight

 america be the great place on the face of the earth and i know million of you still have anxiety you work hard and hard to make end meet and put food on the table you worry about the quality and the safety of your child and the quality of education but even more importantly you worry about the future and will they have the same opportunity that you and i have have

 federal government ’s role

 lehrer mr. president first question there ’ a major difference in your view of the role of the federal government and that of senator dole how would you define the difference

 president clinton well jim i believe that the federal government should give people the tool and try to establish the condition in which they can make the most of their own life that to i be the key and that lead i to some different conclusion from senator dole

 for example we have reduce the size of the federal government to its small size in 30 year we ’ve reduce more regulation eliminate more program than my two republican predecessor but i have work hard for thing like the family and medical leave law the brady bill the assault weapon ban the program to put 100,000 police on the street all of these be program that senator dole oppose that i support because i feel they be a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own life

 i ’ve work hard to help family impart value to their own child i support the v chip so that parent would be able to control what their kid watch on television when they ’re young along with the rating system for television and educational television i support strong action against the tobacco company to stop the marketing advertising and sale of tobacco to young people i support a big increase in the safe and drug free school program

 these be area on which senator dole and i differ but i believe that they be the right area for america to be act together as one country to help individual and family make the most of their own life and raise their kid with good value and a good future

 lehrer senator dole one minute

 senator dole i think the basic difference be and i have have some experience in this i think the basic difference i trust the people the president trust the government

 if you go back and look at the health care plan that he want to impose on the american people one seventh the total economy 17 new taxis price control 35 to 50 new bureaucracy a cost of $ 1.5 trillion do not forget that that happen in 1993 a tax increase that tax everybody in america not just the rich if you make $ 25,000 that ’s the original proposal you get your social security taxis increase we have a btu tax that turn into a $ 35 billion gas tax a $ 265 billion tax increase

 i guess i rely more on the individual i carry a little card around in my pocket call the 10th amendment where possible i want to give power back to the states and back to the people that ’ my difference for the present and we ’ll have specific difference later he note a few but there be other

 lehrer mr. president 30 second

 president clinton i trust the people we ’ve do a lot to give the people more power to make their own decision over their own life but i do think we be right when we try to for example give mother and newborn 48 hour before they can be kick out of the hospital end these drive by delivery i think we be right to pass the kassebaum kennedy bill which state you can not lose your health insurance just because you change job or because someone in your family have be sick

 our government be small and less bureaucratic and have give more authority to the state than its two predecessor under republican president but i do believe we have to help our people get ready to succeed in the 21st century


 state of the nation

 lehrer senator dole the president say in his opening statement we be well off today than we be four year ago do you agree

 senator dole well he ’ well off than he be four year ago laughter

 president clinton i agree with that that ’ right

 senator dole and i may be well off four year from now but—[laughter i do n’t know i look at the slow growth in a century he inherit a growth of 4.7 4.8 percent now it ’ down to about 2.4 percent we ’re go to pass a million bankruptcy this year for the first time in history we ’ve get stagnant wage in fact woman ’s wage have drop 2.2 percent man ’s wage have not go up go down so we have stagnation

 we have the high foreign debt in history and it seem to i that if you take a look be you well off well i guess some may be well off saddam hussein be probably well off than he be four year ago rene preval be probably well off than he be four year ago but be the american people

 they ’re work hard and hard and pay more taxis for the first time in history you pay about 40 percent of what you earn more than you spend for food clothing and shelter combine for taxis under this administration

 so some may be well off they talk about family income be up that ’ not true in connecticut family income be down and it ’ up in some case because both parent be work one work for the family and one work to pay taxis for the government we ’re go to give they a tax cut so they can spend more time with their child maybe even take a vacation that ’ what america be all about

 lehrer mr. president one minute

 president clinton well let i say first of all in february senator dole acknowledge that the american economy be in the good shape it ’s be in in 30 year we have 10 million more job a fast job growth rate than under any republican administration since the 1920s wage be go up for the first time in a decade we have record number of new small business we have the big drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 year all group of people be grow we have the big drop in income inequality in 27 year in 1995 the average family ’s income have go up over $ 1,600 just since our economic plan pass

 so i think it ’ clear that we ’re well off than we be four year ago now we need to focus on what do we need to do to be well off still how can we help people as we be to get their retirement when they work for small business to be able to afford health insurance to be able to educate their child that ’ what i want to focus on but we ’re clearly well off than we be four year ago as senator dole acknowledge this year

 lehrer senator dole

 senator dole i doubt that i acknowledge that this year but in any event i think we just look at the fact we ask the people that be view tonight be you well off than you be four year ago it ’ not whether we ’re well off it ’s whether they ’re well off be you work hard to put food on the table to feed your child be your child get a well education drug use have double the past 44 month all across america crime have go down but it ’ because of mayor like rudy giuliani where one third of the drop happen in one city new york city

 so yes some may be well off but of the people listen tonight the work family who will benefit from our economic package they ’ll be well off when bob dole be president and jack kemp be vice president


 medicare reform

 lehrer mr. president senator dole have come pretty close in the last few day to accuse you of lie about his position on medicare reform have you do so

 president clinton absolutely not let ’s look at the position first of all remember that in this campaign season since senator dole have be a candidate he have brag about the fact that he vote against medicare in the beginning in 1965 one of only 12 member he say he do the right thing then he know it would not work at the time that ’ what he say

 then his budget that he pass along with speaker gingrich cut medicare $ 270 billion more than be necessary to repair the medicare trust fund it would have charge senior more for out of pocket cost as well as more in premium because doctor could have charge they more the american hospital association the nurse association the catholic hospital association all say hundred of hospital could close and people would be hurt badly under the dole gingrich medicare plan that i veto

 and now with this risky $ 550 billion tax scheme of senator dole ’s even his own friend his campaign cochair senator d’amato say that they can not possibly pay for it without cut medicare more and cut social security as well accord to he

 now my balanced budget plan add 10 year to the life of the medicare trust fund—10 year and we ’ll have time to deal with the long term problem of the baby boomer but it be simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut medicare $ 270 billion to run the risk of it wither on the vine we always have to reform it over the year but we need someone who believe in it to reform it

 lehrer senator dole

 senator dole well i must say i look back at the vote on medicare in 1965 we have a program call eldercare that also provide drug and be mean test so people who need medical attention receive it i think it be a good program

 but i have support medicare ever since in fact i use to go home and my mother would tell i say bob all i ’ve get be my social security and my medicare do not cut it i would not violate anything my mother say in fact we have a conversation about our mother one day a very poignant conversation in the white house

 i ’m concern about health care i ’ve have the good health care in government hospital army hospital and i know its importance but we ’ve get to fix it it ’ his trustee the president ’s trustee not mine who say it ’s go to go broke he do not fix it for 10 year

 we ought to appoint a commission just as we do with social security in 1983 when we rescue social security and i be proud to be on that commission along with claude pepper the champion of senior citizen from florida and we can do it again if we take politic out of it

 stop scare the senior mr. president you ’ve already spend $ 45 million scare senior and tear i apart i think it ’ time to have a truce

 lehrer mr. president

 president clinton well let i say first of all i ’d be happy to have a commission deal with this and i appreciate what senator dole do on the 83 social security commission but it will not be possible to do if his tax scheme pass because even his own campaign co chair senator d’amato say he ’ll have to cut medicare even more than be cut in the bill that i veto i veto that bill because it cut more medicare and basically run the risk of break up the system

 my balanced budget plan put 10 year onto medicare we ought to do that then we can have a commission but senator dole ’s plan be not good for the country


 senator dole ’s tax cut proposal

 lehrer senator dole speak of your tax plan do you still think that ’ a good idea the 15 percent across the board tax cut

 senator dole oh yes and you ’ll be eligible laughter

 president clinton i too

 senator dole and so will the former president yes laughter

 president clinton that ’ good i need it

 senator dole well the people need it that ’s the point this be not a wall street tax cut this be a family tax cut this be a main street tax cut fifteen percent across let ’s take a family make $ 30,000 a year that ’ $ 1,261 now maybe to some in this bushnell memorial that ’s not a lot of money but people watch tonight with a couple of kid a work family that ’s four or five month of day care maybe a personal computer it may be three or four month of mortgage payment this economic package be about family but it ’ a six point package first of all it ’ a balanced budget amendment to the constitution which president clinton defeat he twist arm and get six democrats to vote the other way we lose by one vote

 it ’s balance the budget by the year 2002 it ’ the tax cut cut capital gain 50 percent so that you can go out and create more job and more opportunity it ’ a state tax relief it ’ a $ 500 per child tax credit it ’ about litigation reform now that the president get million of dollar from the trial lawyer he probably do not like this provision in fact when i fall off that podium in chico before i hit the ground i have a call on my cell phone from a trial lawyer say i think we ’ve get a case here laughter

 and it ’ also regulatory reform so it ’ a good package mr. president and we ’d like to have your support

 lehrer mr. president

 president clinton well here ’s the problem with it it sound very good but there ’ a reason that 500 economist include seven nobel prize winner and business periodical like business week and even senator dole ’s friend senator warren rudman former republican senator from new hampshire say it be not a practical program it ’ a $ 550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rate and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgage car payment credit card payment college loan and small business loan it ’ not good to raise the deficit we ’ve work too hard to lower it it will actually raise taxis on 9 million people and in addition to that it will force big cut in medicare medicaid education and the environment than the one that he and mr. gingrich pass that i veto last year

 so it sound great but our target tax cut for education childrearing health care and homebuying which be pay for in my balanced budget plan something that he have not do certify by the congressional budget office that ’s the right way to go

 lehrer senator dole

 senator dole the president want to increase spend 20 percent over the next six year i want to increase spend 14 percent that ’ how simple it be i want the government to pinch penny for a change instead of the american family we ’re talk about six percentage point over six year and with that money you give it back to the work people you also provide opportunity scholarship so low income parent will have the same choice that other have in send their child to well school and it will work and when it do work mr. president i know you will congratulate i


 campaign financing

 lehrer mr. president the senator mention trial lawyer and that mean campaign financing how do you personally avoid be unduly influence by people who give you money or give you service in your campaign

 president clinton well i try to articulate my position as clearly as possible tell people what i stand for and let they decide whether they ’re go to support i or not the senator mention the trial lawyer in the case of the product liability bill which they pass and i veto i think that ’ what he ’s talk about i actually want to sign that bill and i tell the people exactly what the congress exactly what kind of bill i would sign now a lot of the trial lawyer do not want i to sign any bill at all but i think we ought to do what we could to cut frivolous lawsuit but they would not make some of the change that i think should be make

 and let i just give you an example i have a person in the oval office who lose a child in a schoolbus accident where a drunk driver cause the accident directly but there be problem with the schoolbus the drunk driver have no money under the new bill if i have sign it a person like that could never have have any recovery i think that be wrong so i give four or five specific example to the congress and i say prove to i that these people could recover but we ’re go to eliminate frivolous lawsuit i ’ll sign the bill

 but generally i believe that a president have to be willing to do what he think be right i ’ve do a lot of thing that be controversial my economic plan my trade position bosnia haiti take on the nra for the first time take on the tobacco company for the first time sometimes you just have to do that because you know it ’ right for the country over the long run that ’ what i ’ve try to do and that ’ what i will continue to do as president

 lehrer senator dole

 senator dole you mean how do he avoid the conflict well i do not know in the case of the trial lawyer when i look at the trial lawyer and when you ’re a few million short you run out to hollywood and pick up $ 2 million to $ 4 million and organize labor come to washington dc and put $ 35 million into the pot now if these be n’t special interest then i ’ve get a lot to learn i be there for a while before i leave on june 11th

 the trial lawyer i don’t my wife be a lawyer we ’re the only two lawyer in washington that trust each other but we ’re lawyer i like lawyer i do n’t dislike trial lawyer but it seem to i there have get to be some end to the frivolous lawsuit and there ’s get to be some cap on punitive damage

 you ’re put a lot of business people out of business small business man and small business woman who pay 70 percent of your $ 265 billion tax increase the large tax increase in the history of america i say that one day and pat moynihan and the democrats say no he say in the history of the world so i modify it the large tax increase in the history of the world and it seem to i that there be a problem there mr. president

 and i will address you as mr. president you do not do that with president bush in 1992

 lehrer mr. president

 president clinton let i say first of all i sign a tort reform bill that deal with civilian aviation a couple of year ago i ’ve prove that i will sign reasonable tort reform

 secondly senator dole have have some pretty harsh comment about special interest money but it be n’t i who oppose what we try to do to save the life of child who be subject to tobacco and then go to the tobacco grower and brag about stand up to the federal government when we try to stop the advertising marketing and sale of tobacco to child and it be not i that let the polluter actually come into the hall of congress into the room and rewrite the environmental law that ’ what speaker gingrich and senator dole do not i

 senator dole that ’ not true

 president clinton so i believe that we should take a different approach to this and talk about how we stand on the issue instead of try to characterize each other ’s motivation i think senator dole and i just honestly disagree

 lehrer well senator dole let i ask you the same question i ask the president how do you avoid be influence by people who contribute money and service to your campaign

 senator dole i think it ’ very difficult let ’s be honest about it that ’s why we need campaign finance reform that ’s why i reach out to the perot voter and we ’ve do about all that we be the reform party the republican party and the perot voter who be look for a home ought to take a look at the republican record whatever it be whatever the checklist be in 92 it ’s all do but campaign finance reform

 i work with senator mitchell who play i i guess in the debate warmup we try six or eight year ago to he appoint three people i appoint three people to get campaign finance reform we could not get it do because it be n’t enforceable you suggest a commission newt gingrich do i ’ve suggest that at least four or five year ago we have a commission on campaign finance reform they send it to congress and we have to vote it up or down that ’ how it work

 we ’re never go to fix it by the party because democrats want a well advantage for themselves we want a well advantage as republicans and that ’s not how it ’s go to work

 but i want to touch on this tobacco thing i know the president ’s be puff a lot on that but i want to go back to 1965 that be my first vote against tobacco company when i say we ought to label cigarette and i ’ve have a consistent record ever since 1965 we pass a bill in 1992 to encourage the states to adopt program to stop kid from smoking all 50 state do it it take three year it be n’t until election year mr. president that you ever think about stop smoking

 what about drug that have increase double in the last 44 month cocaine be up 141 percent or marijuana cocaine up 166 percent and it seem to i that you have a selective memory mine do n’t work that way so i just want to try to correct it as we go along

 lehrer mr. president

 president clinton mr. lehrer i hope we ’ll have a chance to discuss drug later in the program but let i respond to what you say i agree that too many incumbent politician in washington in both party have consistently oppose campaign finance reform that be certainly the case from the minute i get there

 so after speaker gingrich and senator dole take over the congress i go to new hampshire and a man suggest a gentleman that unfortunately just pass away a couple of day ago suggest that we appoint a commission and i shake hand with he on it and i appoint my member and the commission never meet

 and then senator dole ’s ardent supporter senator mccain who be out there today along with senator feingold support sponsor a campaign finance reform proposal i strongly support it and member of senator dole ’s own party in the senate kill it and he be not out there urge they to vote for the mccain feingold bill

 so i think the american people include the perot supporter know that i ’ve have a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform and i will continue to have and i hope we can finally get it in the next session of congress because we need it badly

 lehrer senator dole 30 second

 senator dole well on campaign reform itself we ’re go to get it when we have a bipartisan commission take it out of politic get people who do n’t have any interest in politic but understand the issue and let they make a recommendation to congress

 now we ’re not kid anybody mr. president these be sophisticated people watch tonight million and million of americans they know the republican party have not do it they know the democratic party will not do it we ought to agree that somebody else should do it and then we have to vote it up or down

 president clinton i agree


 teenage drug use

 lehrer mr. president the senator mention drug he ’s suggest in the past that you bear some responsibility for the rise in drug use of teenager in the united states be he right

 president clinton well jim i think every american in any position of responsibility should be concern about what ’s happen i be

 but let ’s look at the overall record overall in america cocaine use have drop 30 percent in the last four year casual drug use down 13 percent the tragedy be that our young people be still increase their use of drug up to about 11 percent total with marijuana and i regret it let i tell you what i ’ve try to do about it

 i appoint a four star general who lead our effort south of the border to keep drug from come into the country as our nation ’s drug czar the most heavily decorate soldier in uniform when he retire we submit the big drug budget ever we have dramatically increase control and enforcement at the border we support a crime bill that have 60 death penalty include the death penalty for drug kingpin and i support a big expansion in the safe and drug free school program to support thing like the d.a.r.e. program because i think all those thing be very important

 do i think that i bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our child still do not understand drug be wrong drug can kill you even though i have consistently oppose the legalization of drug all my public life and work hard against they i think we all do and i hope we can do well

 i do not think this issue should be politicize because my record be clear and i do not think senator dole support use drug i think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it be not dangerous and will not kill they and will not destroy their life get the message and change

 lehrer senator

 senator dole again you ’re very selective mr. president you do not want to politicize drug but it ’ all right to politicize medicare and go out and scare senior citizen and other vulnerable group veteran and people who get pell grant and thing like this i mean you say we have do all these bad thing which be n’t the case

 but it seem to i the record be clear the record be pretty clear in arkansas when you be governor drug use double you resist the appointment of a drug czar there because you think it might interfere with treatment but here you cut the drug czar ’s office 83 percent you have cut interdiction substantially that ’ what i want to stop it from come across the border and in my administration we ’re go to train the national guard to stop it from come across the border

 this be an invasion of drug from all over the world and we have a responsibility you have a surgeon general mccaffrey you have a lady who say we ought to consider legalize drug be that the kind of leadership we need and i will not comment on other thing that have happen in your administration or your past about drug but it seem to i the kid ought to if they have start they ought to stop and just do not do it

 lehrer mr. president

 president clinton let i say again we do have a drug czar in arkansas but he answer to the governor just like this one answer to the president that ’ what i think we ought to do

 secondly senator dole you vote against the crime bill that have the death penalty for drug kingpin in it and you vote to cut service to 23 million school child under the safe and drug free schools act i do not think that mean you ’re soft on drug we just have a different approach but let i remind you that my family have suffer from drug abuse i know what it ’s like to see somebody you love nearly lose their life and i hate drug senator we need to do this together and we can



 gun control

 lehrer senator dole on the government continue to talk about the government ’s role if elect president would you seek to repeal the brady bill and the ban on assault weapon

 senator dole not if i do not have a well idea but i ’ve get a well idea it ’ something i ’ve work on for 15 year it ’s call the automated check or the instant check it ’ be use in 17 state right now states like florida colorado virginia and other state you do not buy any gun you do not get any gun we ’ve get 20 million name on a computer in washington dc of people who should not have a gun we ought to keep gun out of the hand of criminal and there be eight other category that should not have gun i ’ve be work on this for a long long time

 you walk in you put your little card in there if it say tilt you do not get any gun you do not get a handgun you do not get a rifle you do not get a shotgun you get zippo if we ’re go to protect american child and american family and people who live as prisoner in their own home we ’ve get to stop gun from be dump on the street

 the administration say they support the instant check they ’ve appropriate about $ 200 million but only spend about $ 3 million to get it underway in our administration in my administration we will expedite this it keep up the technology it keep gun out of the hand of people who should not have gun that be the bottom line and i believe it ’ a good idea it have strong bipartisan support and perhaps that ’ another thing we can depoliticize

 you talk about the brady bill there ’s only be one prosecution under the brady bill only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the brady bill that you talk about all the time and on the assault weapon ban out of 17 weapon that be ban only six be ban now because 11 have be modify and they ’re back on the street let ’s get together on this instant check because that will really make a difference

 lehrer mr. president

 president clinton the president let i say first of all senator dole have go back and forth about whether he ’d be for repeal the brady bill or repeal the assault weapon ban and i think his present position be that he would not do so and if that ’s true i ’m grateful for it but let ’s look at the fact here

 the brady bill have keep at least 60,000 felon fugitive and stalker from get handgun senator dole lead the fight against the brady bill he try to keep it from come to my desk he do not succeed and i sign it and i ’m glad i do

 then when we have the assault weapon ban in the senate senator dole fight it bitterly and oppose the entire crime bill and almost bring the entire crime bill down because the national rifle association do not want the assault weapon ban just like they do not want the brady bill but two year later nobody have lose their handgun i mean their rifle we ’ve expand the brady bill to cover people who beat up their spouse and their kid and this be a safe country so i ’m glad i take on that fight and i believe with all respect i be right and he be wrong

 senator dole well the president do not have it quite right i mean it seem to i at the time that the assault weapon ban be not effective but that ’ history as i tell the nra that ’ history you ’re not go to worry about it anymore i ’m not go to worry about it anymore let ’s do something well

 let ’s stop play the political game mr. president talk about this and this you add up all the states who have use the instant check and how many weapon they ’ve keep out of the hand of criminal it would far surpass the number you mention so in my view if you want to be protect you ought to vote for bob dole and we ’ll get the instant check pass and we ’ll keep gun out of the hand of criminal



 foreign policy

 lehrer mr. president senator dole say the other day that you practice a photo op foreign policy that have lessen the credibility of the united states throughout the world be he wrong about that

 president clinton if that ’ what he say he ’s not right about that look at where we be today the united states be still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of the cold war and on the brink of the 21st century i have work to support our country as the world ’s strong force for peace and freedom prosperity and security

 we have do the follow thing number one we ’ve manage the aftermath of the cold war support a big drop in nuclear weapon in russia the removal of russian troop from the baltics the integration of central and eastern european democracy into a new partnership with nato and i might add with a democratic russia there be no nuclear missile point at the child of the united states tonight and have not be in our administration for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age

 we have work hard for peace and freedom when i take office haiti be govern by a dictator that have defy the united states when i take office the bad war in europe be wage in bosnia now there be a democratically elect president in haiti peace in bosnia we have just have election there we have make progress in northern ireland and the middle east we ’ve also stand up to the new threat of terrorism the proliferation of weapon of mass destruction organized crime

 and we have work hard to expand america ’s economic presence around the world with the big increase in trade with the large number of new trade agreement in history that ’ one of the reason america be number one in auto production again

 lehrer senator

 senator dole well i have a different view again i ’ve support the president on bosnia and i think we be tell the troop would be out in a year now i understand it ’s be extend til sometime next year

 but let ’s start with somalia where they drag americans through the street and where 18 americans be kill one day because they do not have they be pin down for eight hour the rangers they do not have the weapon they do not have the tank they ask for the tank they do not get the tank from this administration because we be nation build it ’s call mission creep we turn it over to the united nations the president do not have much to do about it

 look at haiti where we ’ve spend about $ 3 billion and we get an alarm call there about two week ago you ’ve get to send down some more people because the president have find out there be death squad on his own property so we need more protection from america

 bosnia northern ireland there be no cease fire in bosnia i think there be still lot of problem in bosnia we agree to train and arm the muslims so they could defend themselves the policy you have when you run in 1992 we have not do that we ’re way behind which mean americans can not come home americans should not have go there in the first place have we let they defend themselves as they have a right to do under article 57 of the united nations charter

 lehrer mr. president

 president clinton first of all i take full responsibility for what happen in somalia but the american people must remember that those soldier be under an american commander when that happen i believe they do the good they could under the circumstance and let ’s not forget that hundred of thousand of life be save there

 secondly in haiti political violence be much much small than it be

 thirdly in bosnia it ’ a virtual miracle that there have be no return to war and at least there have now be an election and the institution be begin to function

 in northern ireland and the middle east we be well off than we be four year ago there will always be problem in this old world but if we ’re move in the right direction and america be lead we ’re well off

 lehrer senator dole if elect president what criterion would you use to decide when to send u.s. troop into harm ’s way

 senator dole well after world war i we have a policy of disengagement then from world war i to world war ii we have sort of a compulsory engagement policy now i think we have to have a selective engagement policy we have to determine when our interest be involve not the united nations interest and many of the thing the president talk about he turn over to the united nations they decide he ’s deploy more troop than any president in history around the world it ’s cost we billion and billion of dollar for peacekeeping operation these be fact

 and it seem to i that when you make a decision the decision be make by the president of the united states by the commander in chief he make that decision when he commit young man or young woman who be go to go around and defend our liberty and our freedom that would be my position

 then i ’m go to have a top down review at the pentagon not a bottom up review where you all fight over how much money be there i want a top down review to determine what our priority be and what we should do in defense and then follow that policy instead of this bottom up review with all of the service fight for the money

 the president say he be go to cut defense $ 60 billion he cut defense $ 112 billion devastate states like california and other and i think now we ’ve get a problem we ’ve get to go back and look it ’ just like you say in texas one day you know you raise taxis too much and you do and you cut defense too much mr. president and you do and you may have say that too

 but the bottom line be we be the strong nation in the world we provide the leadership and we ’re go to have to continue to provide the leadership but let ’s do it on our term when our interest be involve and not when somebody blow a whistle at the united nations

 president clinton our military be the strong military in the world it be the strong well prepare well equipped it have ever be there be very little difference in the budget that i have propose and the republican budget over the next six year period we be spend a lot of money to modernize our weapon system i have propose a lot of new investment to improve the quality of life for our soldier for our man and woman in uniform for their family for their training that be my solemn obligation

 you ask when do you decide to deploy they the interest of the american people must be at stake our value must be at stake we have to be able to make a difference and frankly we have to consider what the risk be to our young man and woman in uniform

 but i believe the evidence be that our deployment have be successful in haiti in bosnia when we move to kuwait to repel saddam hussein ’s threaten invasion of kuwait when i have send the fleet into the taiwan straits when we ’ve work hard to end the north korean nuclear threat i believe the united states be at peace tonight in part because of the discipline careful effective deployment of our military resource

 lehrer senator dole

 senator dole well i fail to mention north korea and cuba a while ago you look at north korea where they have enough plutonium to build six nuclear bomb where we ’ve sort of distance ourselves from our ally south korea they lose about a million people in the war the korean war the forget war we lose 53,000 americans we should not be do any favor for north korea it ’ a closed society we do not have any inspection we do not know whether it ’s go to work or not but we keep give they these incentive some would call they something else incentive we do not know what ’s go to happen

 here we have cuba 90 mile from our shore and what have we do we ’ve pass a law that give people the right to sue and the president postpone it for six month and it seem to i if you want to send a signal you ’ve get to send a signal mr. president the soon the well off we ’ll be if we put tough sanction on castro not try to make it easy for he


 cuba

 lehrer well mr. president what be your attitude toward cuba and how cuba should be treat

 president clinton well first of all for the last four year we have work hard to put more and more pressure on the castro government to bring about more openness and a move toward democracy in 1992 before i become president congress pass the cuba democracy act and i enforce it vigorously we make the embargo tough but we increase contact people to people with the cubans include direct telephone service which be largely support by the cuban american community

 then cuba shoot down two of our plane and murder four people in international airspace they be completely beyond the pale of the law and i sign the helms burton legislation

 senator dole be correct i do give about six month before the effective date of the act before lawsuit can actually be file even though they ’re effective now and can be legally binding because i want to change cuba and the united states need help from other country nobody in the world agree with our policy on cuba now but this law can be use as leverage to get other country to help we to move cuba to democracy

 every single country in latin america central america and the caribbean be a democracy tonight but cuba and if we stay firm and strong we will be able to bring cuba around as well

 senator dole well that ’s the point i make we have to be firm and strong and i hope that will happen it will happen start next january and maybe can happen the balance of this year we have not be firm and strong if you look at the poor people who still live in cuba it ’ a haven for drug smuggler and we do not have a firm policy when it come to fidel castro in my view the policy have fail so congress pass a law the president sign it like he do a lot of thing but he like welfare reform well i ’m go to sign it but i ’m go to try to change it next year

 i mean a lot of these election year conversion the president be talk about all the drug money and all the other thing all this antismoke campaign all happen in 1996 and i think the people view out there ought to go back and take a look at the record when he fight a balanced budget amendment when he give you that big tax increase in history when he try to take over your health care system when he fight regulatory reform that cost the average family $ 6,000 to $ 7,000 a year this be serious business it ’ about your family it ’ about your business and in this case it ’ about a firm policy with cuba

 president clinton there be several off the subject whopper in that litany let i just mention senator dole vote for $ 900 billion in tax increase his runningmate jack kemp once say that bob dole never meet a tax he do n’t hike laughter and everybody know include the wall street journal hardly a friend of the democratic party or this administration that the 82 tax increase he sponsor in inflation adjust dollar be the big tax increase in american history so we ought to at least get the fact out here on the table so we can know where to go from here


 health care reform

 lehrer senator dole you mention health reform several time what do you think should be do about the health care system

 senator dole let i first answer that question about the 1982 tax cut you know we be close loophole we be go after big corporation i know you probably would oppose it mr. president but i think we should have a fair system and a flat system and we will have a fair flatter system and we ’re go to make the economic package work

 health care well we finally pass the kassebaum bill the president be oppose to it in 1993 he want to give we this big system that take over about one seventh the economy that put on price control create all these state alliance and would cost $ 1.5 trillion and force people into manage care whether they want it or not most people want to see their own doctor they ’re go to see their own doctor when bob dole be president we will not threaten anybody

 so we pass the kassebaum kennedy bill that will cover about 20 to 25 million people we ’ve be for that for four five or six year the president hold it up and even when it finally get near passage senator kennedy hold it up for 100 day because he be not satisfied with one provision but it will cover a pre existing condition if you change your job you ’re go to be cover so there be a lot of good thing in this bill that we should have do instead of try this massive massive takeover by the federal government

 but then of course you have a democratic congress and they do not want to do that until we get a republican congress we finally get action and i ’m very proud of my colleague in the republican party for get that do it mean a lot to a lot of people watch we tonight

 president clinton well that sound very good but it ’ very wrong senator dole remember well that we actually offer not to even put in a health care bill in 1994 but instead to work with the senate republicans and write a joint bill and they say no because they get a memo from one of their political adviser say that instead they should characterize whatever we do as big government and make sure nothing be do to aid health care before the 94 election so they could make that claim

 well maybe we bit off more than we could chew but we ’re pursue a step by step reform now the kennedy kassebaum bill that i sign will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change job or when somebody in their family have be sick i sign a bill to stop these drive by delivery where insurance company can force people out of the hospital after 24 hour and i veto senator dole ’s medicare plan that would have force a lot of senior into manage care and take a lot more money out of their pocket and lead to medicare wither on the vine

 lehrer senator

 senator dole well many of the provision in the kassebaum bill be provision my provision like deduction for long term care make certain that self employ people who be watch tonight can deduct not 30 percent but 80 percent of what you pay for premium you can also deduct long term care now so it ’ a good start

 i think we’re even look at our tax cut proposal our economic package there may be a way there to reach out to the uninsured because there be a lot of uninsured people in this country particularly child that should be cover another way you can do it be to expand medicaid in america no one will go without health care no one will go without food

 lehrer senator go ahead and finish your sentence sorry

 senator dole food laughter


 iraq

 lehrer back to foreign affair for a moment mr. president be you satisfied with the way you handle this last iraq crisis and the end result

 president clinton well i believe that we do the appropriate thing under the circumstance

 saddam hussein be under a u.n. resolution not to threaten his neighbor or repress his own citizen unfortunately a lot of people have never be as concerned about the kurds as the united states have try to be and we ’ve be fly an operation to protect they out of turkey for many year now

 what happen be one of the kurdish leader invite he to go up north but we feel since the whole world community have tell he not to do it that once he do it we have to do something we do not feel that i could commit i certainly do not feel i should commit american troop to throw he out of where he have go and that be the only way to do that so the appropriate thing strategically to do be to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbor we do that by expand what ’s call the no fly zone by increase our ally control of the airspace now from the kuwait border to the suburb of baghdad

 be it the right thing to do i believe it be be it fully effective do it make he withdraw from the north well he have a little bit and i hope he will continue we have learn that if you give he an inch he ’ll take a mile we have to do something and even though not all of our ally support it at first i think most of they now believe that what we do be an appropriate thing to do

 lehrer senator dole

 senator dole well the president ’s own cia director say that saddam be strong now than he be and i do not understand extend the no fly zone in the south when the trouble be in the north and what we ’ve do during the bush administration the kurds be at the state department negotiating try to work their difference out now we ’ve get all thousand and thousand of refugee we ’re even ship i guess 3,000 kurds to guam it involve turkey it ’ a real problem and saddam be probably strong than he ever be

 we shoot what 44 cruise missile they’re worth about $ 1.2 million apiece and hit some radar that repair in a couple three day do we inflict any damage no do we have any of our ally help well we have great britain they ’re always very loyal to we and i appreciate that and of course kuwait even though they have to find out they have 5,000 troop come they do not even understand that we have to get their permission

 the bottom line be we go in there alone we ’re suppose to be operate under a u.n. resolution we do it without any of our ally that help we in the gulf

 president clinton senator dole have two or three time before tonight criticize i for work with the u.n. now i ’m be criticize for not work with the u.n.

 senator dole that ’ not the u.n.

 president clinton sometimes the united states have to act alone or at least have to act first sometimes we can not let other country have a veto on our foreign policy i could not send soldier into the north of iraq that would have be wrong i could reduce saddam hussein ’s ability to threaten kuwait and his other neighbor again that ’ what i do i still believe it be the right thing to do



 middle east peace process

 lehrer senator dole on your photo op foreign policy charge against the president

 senator dole not mine

 lehrer no no i mean your charge against the president that he have a photo op foreign policy do the middle east summit last week fall into that category

 senator dole well there be some good picture but do it fall into that category i do n’t know i want to be very serious i have support the president when i think he be right on bosnia i support he on nafta and gatt so it ’ not that we always disagree other disagree with we the mideast be very difficult but it seem to i just as an observer that before you would call somebody to america you would have some notion what the end result might be now maybe it ’s well just to get together and sit down and talk maybe that be the purpose and i know talk have—[inaudible]—starte again today

 but again it ’ almost like an ad hoc foreign policy it ’ ad hoc it ’ sort of well we get up in the morning and read the paper and what country ’s in trouble we ’ll have a meeting to i that ’s not the strategy that i think that people expect from america i think we have lose credibility and i say this very honestly without any partisanship we ’ve lose credibility around the world our ally don’t they’re not certain what we ’re go to do what our reaction what our response be go to be

 nobody suggest send troop to iraq if that be the hint there from the president but i do think that saddam hussein be strong than he be and i do believe that we do not gain a great deal in the mideast by bring three of the four leader one refuse to come to washington dc

 president clinton we have a very consistent policy in the middle east it be to support the peace process to support the security of israel and to support those who be prepared to take risk for peace it be a very difficult environment the feeling be very strong there be extremist in all part of the middle east who want to kill that peace process prime minister rabin give his life because someone in his own country literally hate he for try to bring peace

 i would like to have have a big organized summit but those people be kill each other rapidly innocent arab child innocent israeli people they be die so much trust have break down in the aftermath of the change of government i feel that if i could just get the party together to say let ’s stop the violence start talk commit to the negotiation that would be a plus

 now today the secretary of state be in the middle east and they ’ve start negotiation and all of those leader promise i they would not quit until they resolve the issue between they and get the peace process go forward again

 lehrer senator dole

 senator dole well i be disappoint the president do not call for an unconditional end to the violence i mean it seem to i the violence would stop when these leader come to america the killing and the tragedy have take place and it ’ unfortunate and it be a difficult area no doubt about it it should not be politicize in any way by the president or by his opponent and i do not intend to politicize it i hope that they have talk and i hope they ’ve reach some result and that the killing will end



 vision for the future

 lehrer mr. president in your acceptance speech in chicago you say the real choice in this race be quote whether we build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past about whether we believe our good day be still out there or our good day be behind we about whether we want a country of people all work together or one where you ’re on your own end quote be you say that you believe senator dole be a man of the past and if elect president he would lead the country backward

 president clinton well i ’m say that senator dole say in his fine speech in san diego that he want to build a bridge to the past and i think i know what he mean by that he be troubled as i be by some of the thing that go on today but i believe america be the great country in human history because we have maintain freedom and increase prosperity by relentlessly push the barrier of knowledge the barrier of the present always move into the future

 that ’ why when i become president i be determined to kind of move beyond this old stale debate that have go on in washington for too long to get this country move again and that ’ why we ’ve get a country with 10 million more job and record number of new business and rise income and fall crime rate and welfare roll rate that ’s why we ’re move in the right direction

 and i ’m try to emphasize that what i want to do be to continue to do that that ’s why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy that ’s why i want a tax cut for education and childrearing but it ’s get to be pay for that ’s why i want to continue the work we have do over partisan opposition to work with community to bring that crime rate down until our street be all safe again

 these be my commitment i be very oriented toward the future i think this election have to be gear toward the future i think america ’s good day be still ahead but we ’ve get to build the right bridge

 lehrer   senator dole

 senator dole you know the president remind i sometimes of my brother kenny who be no long alive but kenny be a great talker and he use to tell i thing that i know be not quite accurate so we always have a rule we divide by six now maybe in your case maybe just two

 but 11 million new job and everything i mean the president can not take credit for everything that governor be do or that ’s happen in new york city when it come to the murder rate and then not be responsible for the bad thing that happen whether it ’ drug use or something else in america and so it seem to i that we can talk about well we call kenny the great exaggerator because he just like to make it sound a little well it make he feel well when it come to bridge i want a bridge to the future i also want a bridge to the truth we have to tell the truth we ’ve get people watch tonight and listen tonight try to find the truth

 and the truth be there ’ a lot wrong with america we need a strong economic package we need a tax cut we need the $ 500 child credit and we ’ll have that soon

 lehrer mr. president

 president clinton i do not for a moment think i ’m entitle to all the credit for the good thing that have happen in america but where i have move to work with the american people to help they have the tool to make the most of their own life i think i should get some credit for that i also personally take responsibility tonight when senator dole ask i about the drug problem

 but you know i think my idea be well for the future senator dole vote against student loan against head start against create the department of education if he get elect president we ’ll start the new century without anyone in the cabinet of the president represent education and our child i personally do not think that ’s the right kind of future for america and i think we ought to take a different tack



 education

 lehrer senator dole do you still favor eliminate the department of education

 senator dole yes i do not favor it when it be start i vote against it it be a tribute after president carter ’s election to the national education association who send a lot of delegate to the democratic convention who give 99.5 percent of their money to democrats and the president and a lot of the teacher send their kid to private school or well public school

 so what we want to do be call opportunity scholarship now some say oh you ’re republican you can not be reach out to these people i ’ve reach out to people all my life i ’ve work on the food stamp program proudly and the wic program and the school lunch program with senator like george mcgovern hubert humphrey and other to name a few of my democratic friend i ’m not some extremist out here i care about people i have my own little foundation that ’s raise about $ 10 million for the disabled i do n’t advertise it just do have n’t before i try to do a lot of thing that i think might be helpful to people

 so it seem to i that we ought to take that money we can save from the department of education put it into opportunity scholarship and tell little landel shakespeare out in cleveland ohio and tell your mother and father you ’re go to get to go to school because we ’re go to match what the state put up and you ’re go to get to go to the school of your choice

 i do not fault the president or the vice president for send their child to private school or well school i applaud they for it i do not criticize they but why should not everybody have that choice why should not low income americans and low middle income americans i ’m excited about it it ’s go to be a big big opportunity for a lot of people

 president clinton let i say first of all i ’m all for student have more choice we ’ve work hard to expand public school choice in my balanced budget bill there be fund for 3,000 new school create by teacher and parent sometimes by business people call charter school that have no rule they ’re free of bureaucracy and can only stay in existence if they perform and teach child the one that be out there be do well

 what i ’m against be senator dole ’s plan to take money away from all of the child we now help with limited federal fund and help far few if we ’re go to have a private voucher plan that ought to be do at the local level or the state level but senator dole have consistently oppose federal help to education he vote against student loan he vote against my improved student loan plan he vote against the national service bill against the head start bill he vote against our effort in safe and drug free school he have vote against these program he do not believe it that ’ the issue

 ninety percent of our kid be out there in those public school and we need to lift their standard and move they forward with the program like those i ’ve outline in this campaign

 senator dole i have well correct the president i do not know what time it be but it ’s probably get late but i want to correct all of these thing i vote against they be probably part of some big package that have a lot of pork in it or a lot of thing that we should not have have and we probably vote no i ’ve support all of the education program i ’ve support head start i think we ought to look at it

 so i do not want anybody out there to think that we ’ve just be vote no no no let ’s give low income parent the same right that people of power and prestige have in america and let they go to well school let ’s turn the school back to the teacher and back to the parent and take it away from the national education association

 lehrer mr. president what ’ wrong with the school choice proposal

 president clinton i support school choice i support school choice i have advocate expansion of public school choice alternative and i say the creation of 3,000 new school that we be go to help the states to finance

 but if you ’re go to have a private voucher plan that ought to be determine by state and locality where they ’re raise and spend most of the money i simply think it ’ wrong to take money away from program that be helping build basic skill for kids—90 percent of they be in the public school to take money away from program that be helping fund the school lunch program that be help to fund the other program that be help our school to improve their standard

 our school be get well and our school can be make to be even well still with the right kind of community leadership and partnership at the school level i have be a strong force for reform and senator i remind you that a few year ago when i support a teacher testing law in my home state i be pretty well lambaste by the teacher association i just do not believe we ought to be out there run down teacher and attack they the way you do at the republican convention i think we ought to be lift they up and move our child forward

 and let i just say that budget you pass that i veto would have cut 50,000 kid out of head start it would have eliminate the americorps plan and it would have cut back on student loan and scholarship now it would have that ’ a fact that ’ one of the big reason i veto it we need to be do more in education not less

 senator dole well the americorps program i must say if that ’s one of your success i would not speak about it too loudly it ’s cost about $ 27,000 to pay people to volunteer we ’ve get four million young people volunteer every year the number have not go down and you pick out 20,000 whether they need the money or not and they get pay for volunteering

 i like young people i like teacher i ’m a product of public school you attend a private school for some time in your life i like teacher you ’re not for school choice you can not be for school choice because it ’ that special interest money again when you ’re get 99.5 percent of the money we do not know what happen to the other .5 percent we ’re look for it somebody get it but it all go to democrats and this be part of that liberal establishment one of those liberal thing that you just can not do you ’re for school uniform and curfew and you ’re oppose to truancy now that ’ not reform mr. president

 why can n’t landel shakespeare in cleveland or pilar gonzalez in milwaukee give their child an opportunity to go to a well school some school be not safe some school be not even safe your choice be nothing let ’s give they a real choice the kind of choice you have and the kind of choice a lot of people have in america if we want to stop crime and teenage pregnancy let ’s start with education

 president clinton first of all senator dole let ’s set the record straight i be able for two year when i be a very young boy to go to a catholic school but i basically go to public school all my life and i ’ve work hard for a long time to make they well ninety percent of our kid be there

 it ’ amazing to i you be all for have more responsibility at the local level for everything except school where we do n’t have very much money at the federal level to spend on education we ought to spend it help the 90 percent of the kid that we can help if a local school district in cleveland or anyplace else want to have a private school choice plan like milwaukee do let they have at it i might say the result be highly ambiguous but i want to get out there and give a well education opportunity to all of our child and that ’ why i veto the budget that you pass with $ 30 billion in education cut it be wrong and my plan for the future be well


 political philosophy

 lehrer mr. president

 senator dole at the republican convention you say the following and i quote it be demean to the nation that within the clinton administration a corps of the elite who never grow up never do anything real never sacrifice never suffer and never learn should have the power to fund with your earning their dubious and self serve scheme end quote whom precisely and what precisely do you have in mind

 senator dole i have precisely in mind a lot of the people that be in the white house and other agency who have never be have any experience who come to washington without any experience they ’re all very liberal of course or they would not be in the administration and their idea be that they know what be good for the american people

 now i feel very strongly about a lot of thing i feel strongly about education i want to help young people have an education just as i have an education after world war ii with the gi bill of right and we ’ve have million of young man and woman in subsequent war change the face of the nation because the government help with their education

 now the reason they do not want to have you know the reason the president can not support this be pretty obvious it ’s not take anything away from school it ’ new money it ’s not go to be take away from anybody else except it will downsize the department of education

 but this be a very liberal administration this be the administration that give you the big tax cut this be the administration that try to take over health care and impose a governmental system this be the administration that fight regulatory reform and that ’s put a lot of small business man and small business woman out of business this be the administration that fight the balanced budget amendment and veto a balanced budget and veto welfare reform twice and the list go on and on and on

 that ’ what i have in mind i want people in my administration and will have people in my administration who understand america there will not be 10 millionaire and 14 lawyer in the cabinet they ’ll be people with experience and people who understand america and people who know the hard knock in life

 president clinton when senator dole make that remark about all the elitist young elitist in the administration one of the young man who work for i who grow up in a house trailer look at i and say mr. president i know how you grow up who be he talk about and you know this liberal charge that ’ what their party always drag out when they get in a tight race it ’ sort of their golden oldie you know it ’ a record they think they can play that everybody love to hear laughter and i just do not think that dog will hunt this time

 the american people should make up their own mind here ’ the record we cut the deficit four year in a row for the first time since before the civil war i mean before world war ii and maybe before the civil war too laughter we ’ve get 10 million new job we ’ve get record number of new small business we make every one of they eligible for a tax cut we ’ve get decline crime rate two million few people on welfare roll before welfare reform pass and a 50 percent increase in child support and a crime bill with 60 death penalty 100,000 police and the assault weapon ban

 the american people can make up their mind about whether that ’ a liberal record or a record that ’ good for america liberal conservative you put whatever label you want on it

 senator dole well i think it ’ pretty liberal i ’ll put that label on it when you take a look at all the program you ’ve advocate mr. president thank goodness we have a republican congress there the first thing you do when you come into office be send up a stimulus package that say we ’ve get a little pork we want to scatter around america $ 16 billion and even some in your own party could not buy that

 i remember talk by the telephone i’m not even certain you be too excited about it i’ll never repeat what i talk with the president about but in any event we save the taxpayer $ 16 billion and then come some other program and then come health care and then come the tax increase and a lot of these thing just stop in 1994 because then the congress change and i think we ’ve do a good job

 lehrer mr. president if you ’re not a liberal describe your political philosophy

 president clinton i believe that the purpose of politic be to give people the tool to make the most of their own life to reinforce the value of opportunity and responsibility and to build a sense of community so we ’re all work together i do not believe in discrimination i believe you can protect the environment and grow the economy i believe that we have to do these thing with a government that ’s small and less bureaucratic but that we have to do they nonetheless

 it ’ inconvenient for senator dole but the truth be i ’ve reduce the size of government more than my republican predecessor and i do stop they i admit that i sure stop their budget their budget cut enforcement for the environmental protection agency by a third it cut fund to clean up toxic waste dump with 10 million of our kid still live within four mile of a toxic waste dump by a third it end the principle of the polluter should pay for those toxic waste dump unless it be very recent their budget weaken our support for education $ 30 billion even cut fund for scholarship and college loan their budget cut $ 270 billion in medicare and finally their budget withdraw the national guarantee of health care to poor child family with child with handicap the elderly in nursing home poor pregnant woman it be wrong for the country and call it conservative will not make it right it be a bad decision for america and would have be bad for our future if i have not stop it

 senator dole well the president can define himself in any way he want but i think we have to look at the record go back to the time he be what texas director for george mcgovern george mcgovern be a friend of mine so i do n’t mean but he be a liberal proud liberal

 i ’ve just finish read a book i think it ’s call what be it the demise of the democratic party by ronald radosh or something talk about all the liberal influence in the administration whether it ’ organize labor or whether it ’ the hollywood elite or whether it ’s some of the medium elite or whether it ’ the labor union or whatever

 and so i think you take a look at it but the bottom line be this i think the american people probably lose sight of all of these bill and all these thing they want to know what ’s go to happen to they they ’ve all get a lot of anxiety out there

 do anybody complain when you raise taxis do anybody go out and ask the people how be you go to pay the extra money that ’ why we want an economic package we want the government to pinch their penny for a change instead of the people pinch their penny that ’ what our message be to people watch not all this back and forth you vote this way you vote that way we want a well america as we go into the next century

 president clinton the way to get a well america be to balance the budget and protect medicare medicaid education and the environment to give a target tax cut and let i talk about the education tax cut to let people have a $ 10,000 deduction for the cost of college tuition in any year any kind of college tuition to give family a tax credit a dollar for dollar reduction in their taxis for the cost of a typical community college so we can open that to everybody and then to let people save in an ira and withdraw from it without a tax penalty for education homebuying or medical expense that ’s the right way to go into the 21st century balance the budget and cut taxis not balloon with this $ 550 billion tax scheme


 personal differences

 lehrer senator dole we ’ve talk mostly now about difference between the two of you that relate to policy issue and that sort of thing be there also significant difference in the more personal area that be relevant to this election

 senator dole let i say first on the president ’s promise for another tax cut i mean i ’ve tell people as i travel around all of you who get the tax cut he promise last time vote for he in 96 and not many hand go up so the question be would you buy a use election promise from my opponent

 the people want economic reform they ’re have a hard time make end meet you get one parent work for the government the other parent work for the family and this be important business this be about get the economy move again this be about american job and opportunity it ’ about the government as i say before pinch its penny for a change instead of the poor taxpayer when they raise your taxis nobody run around ask people where be you go to get the extra money i think the government can do well

 lehrer be there personal difference that be relevant to this

 senator dole well my blood pressure be low and my weight my cholesterol but i will not make health an issue in this campaign laughter i think he ’ a bit tall than i be but i think there be personal difference i mean i do n’t like to get into personal matter

 as far as i ’m concern this be a campaign about issue it ’ about my vision for america and about his liberal vision for america and not about personal thing and i think his liberal vision be a thing of the past i know he want to disown it i would not want to be a liberal either mr. president but you ’re stick with it because that ’s your record it ’ your record in arkansas the big tax increase in history the big crime increase in history big drug increase in history in arkansas

 lehrer mr. president

 president clinton well just for the record when i be a governor we have the low second low tax burden of any state in the country the high job growth rate of any state when i run for president and be widely recognize for a lot of other advance

 but the important thing be what be we go to do now i think a target tax cut be well for our future target to education and childrearing with the rest of the education plan hook up all of our classroom to the internet by the year 2000 make sure we ’ve get an army of read volunteer train people to teach with parent and teacher so that our 8 year old can learn to read invest in our environment clean up two third of the bad toxic waste dump those plan be well than this $ 550 billion tax scheme

 now remember folk even senator dole ’s campaign cochair senator d’amato say he ’s get to cut medicare to pay for this everybody who have look at it 500 economist seven nobel prize winner say it ’ bad for the economy it ’s go to blow a hole in the deficit raise taxis on nine million people and require big cut than the one i veto

 our plan be well it will take we into the future with a grow economy and healthy family

 senator dole well i ’m really encourage to know of your renew friendship with al d’amato and i know he appreciate it laughter you do not even have tax cut in your budget mr. president the first two year you be president it be n’t until we have a republican congress that you even think about you talk about tax cut

 and get back to personal difference i think jim if you ’re a little more specific but i think the president could clarify one thing tonight and that ’s the question of pardon i know you talk about it with jim lehrer on the pbs show and i ’ve never discuss whitewater as i ’ve tell you personally i ’m not discuss whitewater now but i be discuss a power the president have to grant pardon and hopefully in the next segment you could lay that to rest

 lehrer mr. president

 president clinton well first of all he make that remark about senator d’amato he ’s arrange for i to spend a lot more time with senator d’amato in the last couple of year and so i ’m more familiar with his comment than i use to be laughter

 let i say what i ’ve say already about this pardon issue this be an issue they bring up there have be no consideration of it no discussion of it i ’ll tell you this i will not give anyone special treatment and i will strictly adhere to the law and that be what every president have do as far as i know in the past but whatever other president have do this be something i take seriously and that ’ my position

 senator dole but it seem to i the president should not have any comment at all particularly where it ’ someone where you ’ve have business dealing i mean you may be send a signal i do n’t know i ’m not question anybody but as the president of the united states when somebody ask you about pardon you say no comment period and i think he make a mistake and i think when you make a mistake you say i make a mistake but apparently his position have n’t change

 if there be other specific area but beyond that i have not get into any of these thing as the president know we ’ve have that discussion and again i know senator d’amato i think may have have a hearing or two on whitewater i can not remember laughter but he ’ not my general chairman he ’ a friend of mine and so be senator kennedy a friend of your

 president clinton you bet

 senator dole i remember one day on the floor i say now gentleman let i tax your memory and kennedy jump up and say why have n’t we think of that before laughter one of your liberal friend

 president clinton that ’ right thank you

 lehrer mr. president 30 second

 president clinton no comment laughter

 senator dole what ’s the subject matter laughter

 lehrer senator dole if you could single out one thing that you would like for the voter to have in their mind about president clinton on a policy matter or a personal matter what would it be something to know about he understand it and appreciate it

 senator dole see if i say anything it ’s go to be misconstrue i do not think this be even a race between the two it ’ about our vision for america i happen to like president clinton personally i ’m address he all evening as mr. president i say in 1992 he do not extend that courtesy to president bush but i respect the presidency

 i ’ve serve under a number of president they all have their strength and they all have their weakness so i ’d rather talk about my strength i think i have my strength i think the good thing go for bob dole be that bob dole keep his word it ’ a question between trust and fear and i would say i think mr. president about all you ’ve got go in this campaign be fear you ’re spend million and million of dollar in negative ad frightening senior citizen i know this to be a fact because i have one tell i last week senator do not cut my medicare

 i ’m try to save your medicare just as i rescue social security with a bipartisan commission i have relative on medicare i use to sign welfare check for my grandparent i know all about poverty and all about need and all about take care of people and that ’s be my career in the united states senate

 and i ’ll keep my word on the economic package if i could not cut taxis and balance the budget at the same time i would not look you in the eye tonight in your living room or wherever you may be and say that this be good for america people will tell you who have serve with bob dole agree or disagree he keep his word that ’ what this race be all about

 president clinton i ’d like the american people to know that i have work very hard to be on their side and to move this country forward and we ’re well off than we be four year ago

 but the most important thing be my plan for the 21st century be a well plan a target tax cut a real commitment to educational reform a deep commitment to make welfare reform work with incentive to the private sector to move people from welfare to work now we have to create those job now that we ’re require people to go to work a commitment to step by step health care reform with the next step help people who be between job to access health care and not lose it just because they ’re out of work for a while a commitment to grow the economy while protect the environment

 that ’ what i ’d like they to know about i that i ’ve get up every day and work for the american people and work so that their child could have their dream come true and i believe we ’ve get the result to show we ’re on the right track the most important thing be i believe we ’ve get the right idea for the future

 and like senator dole i like senator dole you can probably tell we like each other we just see the world in different way and you folk out there be go to have to choose who you think be right

 senator dole well i ’d say you know the first homeless bill in the senate be the dole byrd bill part of the byrd dole bill i can not remember who be in control then i remember work with senator ribicoff from connecticut on the hospice program we now have 2,500 hospice

 as i say i remember i ’ve work all my life while i be in the congress i leave on june 11 because i want the american people to know that i be willing to give up something president clinton run for governor in 1990 and say he be go to fill out his term but he do n’t he ’ president so i guess it ’ a little well deal

 but i want the american people to know that i be willing to give up something it be not just get more power and more power so i roll the dice i put my career on the line because i really believe the future of america be on the line we can give you all these number they do not mean a thing if you ’re out of work you have nothing to eat or you can not have medical care or you ’re hold a crack baby in your arm right now and what do you do next

 you know america ’s good day be ahead of we i ’ve see the tough time i know they can be well and i ’ll lead america to a bright future

 lehrer mr. president what do you say to senator dole ’s point that this election be about keep one ’s word

 president clinton let ’s look at that when i run for president i say we ’d cut the deficit in half in four year we ’ve cut it by 60 percent i say that our economic plan would produce eight million job we have 10 million new job we ’re number one in auto again record number of new small business i say we ’d pass a crime bill that would put 100,000 police on the street ban assault weapon and deal with the problem that ought to be deal with with capital punishment include capital punishment for drug kingpin and we do that

 i say we would change the way welfare work and even before the bill pass we have move nearly two million people from welfare to work work with states and community i say we ’d get tough on child support and child support enforcement be up 50 percent

 i say that i would work for tax relief for middle class americans the deficit be big than i think it be go to be and i think they ’re well off all of we be that we get those interest rate down and the deficit down the republicans talk about it but we ’re the first administration in anybody ’s lifetime look at this program to bring that deficit down four year in a row we still give tax cut to 15 million work americans and now i ’ve get a plan that have be out there for two year it could have be pass already but instead the republicans shut the government down to try to force their budget and their plan on i and i could not take that but we ’ll get the rest of that tax relief

 and so i think when you can look at those result you know that the plan i have lay out for the future have a very good chance of be enact if you ’ll give i a chance to build that bridge to the 21st century

 lehrer senator

 senator dole well there he go again i mean it ’ a line that have be use before but exaggerate all of the thing he do he do not do all these thing let ’s take all of these 4 you know year in a row he come in with a high growth rate the 1990 budget agreement which some do n’t like have some very tough cost control it put a lot of pressure on congress the s&amp;l crisis be over they be start to sell asset all of that money be come in and he cut defense an extra $ 60 billion throw a lot of people out of work

 he talk about a small government there be actually more people in government except for the people in defense relate job they ’re go the government be big than it be when president kennedy be around even though he say it ’ not in addition the republican congress cut $ 53 billion so let ’s give credit where credit be due

 governor engler in michigan cut taxis 21 time create a lot of new job so do governor thompson so do governor rowland and a lot of people out there deserve credit mr. president when i ’m president of the united states we ’re go to have a governors council and we ’re go to work directly with the governors republicans and democrats to the get power back to people and back to the state

 president clinton i think a lot of people deserve credit and i ’ve try to give it to they but i believe that my plan be well than senator dole ’s ill advise $ 550 billion scheme which i will say again will blow a hole in the deficit

 our plan will balance the budget and grow the economy preserve the environment and invest in education we have the right approach for the future and look at the result it be not midnight in america senator we be well off than we be four year ago

 lehrer all right that ’s the last question the last answer let ’s go now to the closing statement

 senator dole be we do

 lehrer mr. president you ’re first two minute

 president clinton well first jim let i thank you and thank you senator dole and thank you lady and gentleman all of you listen tonight for the chance you ’ve give we to appear i want to say in the beginning that i be profoundly grateful for the chance that you have give i to serve as president for the last four year i never could have dream anything like this would come my way in life and i ’ve do my good to be faithful to the charge you ’ve give i

 i ’m proud of the fact that america be strong and more prosperous and more secure than we be four year ago i ’m glad we ’re go in the right direction and i ’ve do my good tonight to lay out my plan for go forward to an even well future in the next century

 i ’d like to leave you with the thought that the thing i do as president be basically drive by the people whose life i have see affect by what do or do not happen in this country the autoworker in toledo who be unemployed when i be elect and now have a great job because we ’re number one in auto production again all the people i ’ve meet who use to be on welfare who be now work and raise their child and i think what other could do for our country and for themselves if we do the welfare reform thing in the proper way

 i think of the man who grab i by the shoulder once with tear in his eye and say his daughter be die of cancer and he thank i for give he a chance to spend some time with she without lose his job because of the family and medical leave act

 i think of all the people that i grow up with and go to school with whom i stay in touch with and who never let i forget how what we do in washington affect all of you out there in america

 folk we can build that bridge to the 21st century big enough and strong enough for all of we to walk across and i hope that you will help i build it

 lehrer senator dole your closing statement sir

 senator dole thank you jim thank you mr. president thank everyone for watch and listen

 i want to address my remark to the young people of america because they ’re the one that be go to spend most of their life in the 21st century they ’re the one who have the challenge and there be people out there make prediction that it ’s not go to be the same you ’re not go to have the opportunity there be go to be more deficit more drug more crime and less confidence in the american people and that ’ what you ’re face with what the parent be face with and the grandparent be face with it ’ important it ’ their future

 and i would say to those i know there be more young people experiment with drug today than ever before drug use have go up and if you care about the future of america if you care about your future just do not do it

 well that be why when our federal government employee be single out for hatred when a horrible tragedy like oklahoma city occur when a black or a white church be burn or a synagogue or a mosque be deface in america we must stand against that because we know that we be all in this together that we be go to rise or fall together that we have a duty to help each other in our work in our family in our life as citizen a duty to live in a way that enable we to find common ground and a responsibility to give everyone else the opportunity to go over that bridge with we into tomorrow
 now president lincoln once paraphrase jesus sermon in st. matthew when he say the house divide against itself can not stand i do not have time to go back and read it today but i believe that the whole verse say a city and a house divide against itself can not stand"—not tampa not st. petersburg not washington dc not the united states of america four year ago when i ask for this job i be worried because our people be divide and dispirit and as a result we be not do together what we should have be do to lift our economy or deal with the whole array of problem plague our society involve so many of our child of their future
 now i know i be preach to a choir today—[laughter]—but in the next 2 day we need the choir to preach laughter we will never be what we ought to be if we allow our country to be lead by those who believe we be well off on our own and who seek to pursue that path by drive wedge between we and exploit our fear and convince we that our brother and sister of different race different faith different walk of life be our inherent enemy that be the prescription for disaster in the holy land in bosnia in africa and in the united states and we have only become great at each stage along the way because every time we have to face the music we choose common ground over the shift sand of division and that be what we must do again in this season of our decision
 we have see the result of the politic of division and gridlock but now we have see the result of the politic of opportunity and responsibility and the common ground we seek to build in our american community we have more job a low deficit high growth the high rate of homeownership in 15 year the high rate of homeownership and small business ownership among african americans other minority and woman in the history of america it turn out give everybody a chance not a guarantee but a chance be good for the rest of we
 while all these big number be occur we have see the big decline in inequality among work people in 27 year the big drop in child poverty in 20 year the low rate of poverty ever record for senior citizen and african americans since the statistic have be keep it be the right thing to do for all the rest of we to see that everybody have a chance just as the man struggle for the pool at bethesda be give his chance
 we be see the benefit of great responsibility the welfare roll be down the crime rate be at a 10 year low we see in so many other areas—4 year of decline teenage pregnancy the first drop in out of wedlock pregnancy in 20 year community effort build up all over the country more and more people go in our school to tell our child that drug be wrong and illegal and can kill you more and more citizen effort work with the police to try to help keep the street safe more and more community do thing to try to help our young people stay out of trouble like curfew policy or even school uniform policy and other thing these experiment go on in america people work together to try to find way to be responsible citizen and every place it be do we be well off
 we be see a deep sense of community try to preserve our natural environment for our child and our grandchild i thank governor chiles for the work he have do on the everglade every person in florida in the farth northern corner of florida have a stake in that every person in the farth northwest corner of america have a stake in save our common heritage
 we see it in so many other way we have be move by the enormous upswelling of american conviction in the aftermath of oklahoma city the reaction to the church burning be so negative our common sense whenever it prevail to bring we together as a community make we strong
 and i really believe we be on the verge of the most exciting period in human history but we can not forget what bring we here because it will take we home so the trick for we be to find out with god 's wisdom how to seize all these fabulous opportunity that be out there in a way that enable we to move close to our value
 it be really true that none of we live by bread alone i do not know any serious person who be live long enough who believe that with all the bread in the world you can be really happy laughter on the other hand it be important not to be too self righteous i always say one of my rule of politic be whenever you hear a person stand on a corner scream this be not a money problem sure as the world he be talk about somebody else 's problem not his laughter
 so we need to be a little humble about this but we have work to do if you think about what our child can do if we could put every child in america from the poor inner city to the most remote rural area in a classroom with a computer that be hook up to the entire information superhighway then for the first time ever every child in america would have access to the same learning in the same way at the same time that would revolutionize what our child could do all of our child
 if we could put a million citizen with 100,000 more police and walk the block together we could have not 4 year but 8 year of decline crime and all of our child could feel safe on their street and in their school and in their neighborhood we can reclaim our street four year ago million of people do not believe we could ever do anything about rise crime now we have no excuse we know we can bring it down for 4 year but we know we have to have about 4 more year before it will be tolerable to live in still a lot of our place but we can make our street safe again we know that but we will have to do that together and we can do that in the future
 we know that we be break down the frontier of ignorance in so many way that will help we to cure cancer that will help we to find way to grow our economy while we improve our environment that will help we to find way to create job for people who have never be able to get they before but we have work to do i sign a law that say that everybody on welfare who be able bodied will keep get health care and food and child care if they go to work but if they be able bodied they have get to trade the welfare check for a paycheck in 2 year that be the law but now we have figure out something we have not really be able to figure out for a long time which be how to give job to people you can not tell people they have to go to work unless there be work for they to find so we have get work to do
 we know we have get work to do in build our american family we know there be still too many kid who do not think drug will kill they we know that 3,000 child start smoke every day and a thousand will die soon as a result even though it be illegal we know that even though we have remove a lot of assault weapon from our street and make it hard for criminal to get gun there be still too many completely innocent child be kill we know that even though we have demonstrate in our administration that you can have diversity and excellence in my appointment to the cabinet to the federal bench and throughout the country there be still too many people who be literally afraid to deal as equal with people who be different from they we know that
 we know that there be still too many white people who would not feel as comfortable as i do sit in this church today and that be wrong they read the same bible you do they claim the same saviour you do they ought to feel at home here we have get work to do and you ought to feel at home in their church
 so i say to you we have work to do our good day be still ahead but we must always marry our progress to the realization of our value we have to take advantage of progress to move close to living as we say we believe we have work to do and as we get close and close and close to the election the work pass from my hand to yours again it be a very humbling thing for i you know if you ever doubt whether the people be the boss in the end in a democracy run for office laughter run for office even the the president be a hire hand—[laughter try to get a contract renew laughter it be a humbling thing there be a power in freedom that you can not underestimate we take it for grant
 you know now in the last few year for the first time in all of human history more people be live in democracy on the face of the earth than dictatorship it be the first time in all of human history just in the last few year think how far your ancestor walk think how many bleed and die to give you the right to vote and think what a blessing it be that you be anchor in what you believe and that you be not subject to the wild wind that often blow through the airwave at election time
 i ask you to let i share this story as i close in 1992 when i be seek this office i be in a church much like this in cleveland one night it be a warm night and the church be without air conditioner at least the air conditioner be unequal to the hot air all the public official be spew out laughter and we be pack in that church and it be one of those meeting you know where everybody there talk but three people and they go home mad laughter everybody talk we all get to talk
 and the temperature rise and people start want to get out and the great pastor in that church stand up who be a friend of mine reverend otis moss one of america 's great preacher some of you may know he and he start talk to the people about the simple act of voting and he say you know my father could not vote the law do not allow he to vote and finally one day the law be change and he could vote and he walk 7 mile to the polling place but the people do not want my father to vote and they say mr. moss you be at the wrong place so they send he to another place and he walk a couple of more mile and they say mr. moss you be still at the wrong place and they send he to another place and he have to walk a couple of more mile and when they get there they say mr. moss the poll have close
 and he say when my daughter be old enough to vote i take she to the polling place and we go together to two voting machine side by side and i know you be not suppose to linger in the ballot booth but i could not vote i put my ear right next to that booth until i hear my daughter vote we do not miss vote at our house he say
 this be a day that the lord hath make let we rejoice and be glad in it and let we remember that here on earth god 's work must truly be our own we have work to do but if we do it and if we remember like jesus that even the man who could not reach the pool at bethesda we will all go forward on that bridge to the 21st century together
 thank you and god bless you

my fellow citizen at this last presidential inauguration of the 20th century let we lift our eye toward the challenge that await we in the next century it be our great good fortune that time and chance have put we not only at the edge of a new century in a new millennium but on the edge of a bright new prospect in human affair a moment that will define our course and our character for decade to come we must keep our old democracy forever young guide by the ancient vision of a promise land let we set our sight upon a land of new promise

 the promise of america be bear in the 18th century out of the bold conviction that we be all create equal it be extend and preserve in the 19th century when our nation spread across the continent save the union and abolish the awful scourge of slavery

 then in turmoil and triumph that promise explode onto the world stage to make this the american century and what a century it have be america become the world 's mighty industrial power save the world from tyranny in two world wars and a long cold war and time and again reach out across the globe to million who like we long for the blessing of liberty

 along the way americans produce a great middle class and security in old age build unrivaled center of learn and open public school to all split the atom and explore the heaven invent the computer and the microchip and deepen the well spring of justice by make a revolution in civil right for african americans and all minority and extend the circle of citizenship opportunity and dignity to woman

 now for the third time a new century be upon we and another time to choose we begin the 19th century with a choice to spread our nation from coast to coast we begin the 20th century with a choice to harness the industrial revolution to our value of free enterprise conservation and human decency those choice make all the difference at the dawn of the 21st century a free people must now choose to shape the force of the information age and the global society to unleash the limitless potential of all our people and yes to form a more perfect union

 when last we gather our march to this new future seem less certain than it do today we vow then to set a clear course to renew our nation in these 4 year we have be touch by tragedy exhilarate by challenge strengthen by achievement america stand alone as the world 's indispensable nation once again our economy be the strong on earth once again we be build strong family thrive community well educational opportunity a clean environment problem that once seem destine to deepen now bend to our effort our street be safe and record number of our fellow citizen have move from welfare to work

 and once again we have resolve for our time a great debate over the role of government today we can declare government be not the problem and government be not the solution we the american people we be the solution our founder understand that well and give we a democracy strong enough to endure for century flexible enough to face our common challenge and advance our common dream in each new day

 as time change so government must change we need a new government for a new century humble enough not to try to solve all our problem for we but strong enough to give we the tool to solve our problem for ourselves a government that be small live within its mean and do more with less yet where it can stand up for our value and interest around the world and where it can give americans the power to make a real difference in their everyday life government should do more not less the preeminent mission of our new government be to give all americans an opportunity not a guarantee but a real opportunity to build well life

 beyond that my fellow citizen the future be up to we our founder teach we that the preservation of our liberty and our union depend upon responsible citizenship and we need a new sense of responsibility for a new century there be work to do work that government alone can not do teach child to read hire people off welfare roll come out from behind lock door and shutter window to help reclaim our street from drug and gang and crime take time out of our own life to serve other

 each and every one of we in our own way must assume personal responsibility not only for ourselves and our family but for our neighbor and our nation our great responsibility be to embrace a new spirit of community for a new century for any one of we to succeed we must succeed as one america the challenge of our past remain the challenge of our future will we be one nation one people with one common destiny or not will we all come together or come apart

 the divide of race have be america 's constant curse and each new wave of immigrant give new target to old prejudice prejudice and contempt cloak in the pretense of religious or political conviction be no different these force have nearly destroy our nation in the past they plague we still they fuel the fanaticism of terror and they torment the life of million in fractured nation all around the world

 these obsession cripple both those who hate and of course those who be hate rob both of what they might become we can not we will not succumb to the dark impulse that lurk in the far region of the soul everywhere we shall overcome they and we shall replace they with the generous spirit of a people who feel at home with one another our rich texture of racial religious and political diversity will be a godsend in the 21st century great reward will come to those who can live together learn together work together forge new tie that bind together

 as this new era approach we can already see its broad outline ten year ago the internet be the mystical province of physicist today it be a commonplace encyclopedia for million of schoolchildren scientist now be decode the blueprint of human life cure for our most fear illness seem close at hand the world be no long divide into two hostile camp instead now we be build bond with nation that once be our adversary grow connection of commerce and culture give we a chance to lift the fortune and spirit of people the world over and for the very first time in all of history more people on this planet live under democracy than dictatorship

 my fellow americans as we look back at this remarkable century we may ask can we hope not just to follow but even to surpass the achievement of the 20th century in america and to avoid the awful bloodshed that stain its legacy to that question every american here and every american in our land today must answer a resounding yes this be the heart of our task with a new vision of government a new sense of responsibility a new spirit of community we will sustain america 's journey

 the promise we seek in a new land we will find again in a land of new promise in this new land education will be every citizen 's most prized possession our school will have the high standard in the world ignite the spark of possibility in the eye of every girl and every boy and the door of high education will be open to all the knowledge and power of the information age will be within reach not just of the few but of every classroom every library every child parent and child will have time not only to work but to read and play together and the plan they make at their kitchen table will be those of a well home a well job the certain chance to go to college

 our street will echo again with the laughter of our child because no one will try to shoot they or sell they drug anymore everyone who can work will work with today 's permanent under class part of tomorrow 's grow middle class new miracle of medicine at last will reach not only those who can claim care now but the child and hard work family too long deny

 we will stand mighty for peace and freedom and maintain a strong defense against terror and destruction our child will sleep free from the threat of nuclear chemical or biological weapon port and airport farm and factory will thrive with trade and innovation and idea and the world 's great democracy will lead a whole world of democracy

 our land of new promise will be a nation that meet its obligation a nation that balance its budget but never lose the balance of its value a nation where our grandparent have secure retirement and health care and their grandchild know we have make the reform necessary to sustain those benefit for their time a nation that fortify the world 's most productive economy even as it protect the great natural bounty of our water air and majestic land and in this land of new promise we will have reform our politic so that the voice of the people will always speak louder than the din of narrow interest regain the participation and deserve the trust of all americans

 fellow citizen let we build that america a nation ever move forward toward realize the full potential of all its citizen prosperity and power yes they be important and we must maintain they but let we never forget the great progress we have make and the great progress we have yet to make be in the human heart in the end all the world 's wealth and a thousand army be no match for the strength and decency of the human spirit

 thirty four year ago the man whose life we celebrate today speak to we down there at the other end of this mall in word that move the conscience of a nation like a prophet of old he tell of his dream that one day america would rise up and treat all its citizen as equal before the law and in the heart martin luther king 's dream be the american dream his quest be our quest the ceaseless strive to live out our true creed our history have be build on such dream and labor and by our dream and labor we will redeem the promise of america in the 21st century

 to that effort i pledge all my strength and every power of my office i ask the members of congress here to join in that pledge the american people return to office a president of one party and a congress of another surely they do not do this to advance the politic of petty bickering and extreme partisanship they plainly deplore no they call on we instead to be repairer of the breach and to move on with america 's mission america demand and deserve big thing from we and nothing big ever come from be small let we remember the timeless wisdom of cardinal bernardin when face the end of his own life he say it be wrong to waste the precious gift of time on acrimony and division

 fellow citizen we must not waste the precious gift of this time for all of we be on that same journey of our life and our journey too will come to an end but the journey of our america must go on

 and so my fellow americans we must be strong for there be much to dare the demand of our time be great and they be different let we meet they with faith and courage with patience and a grateful happy heart let we shape the hope of this day into the noble chapter in our history yes let we build our bridge a bridge wide enough and strong enough for every american to cross over to a blessed land of new promise

 may those generation whose face we can not yet see whose name we may never know say of we here that we lead our beloved land into a new century with the american dream alive for all her child with the american promise of a more perfect union a reality for all her people with america 's bright flame of freedom spread throughout all the world

 from the height of this place and the summit of this century let we go forth may god strengthen our hand for the good work ahead and always always bless our america

mr. speaker mr. vice president member of the 105th congress distinguished guest and my fellow americans i think i should start by say thank for invite i back i come before you tonight with a challenge as great as any in our peacetime history and a plan of action to meet that challenge to prepare our people for the bold new world of the 21st century

 we have much to be thankful for with four year of growth we have win back the basic strength of our economy with crime and welfare roll decline we be win back our optimism the endure faith that we can master any difficulty with the cold war recede and global commerce at record level we be help to win an unrivaled peace and prosperity all across the world

 my fellow americans the state of our union be strong but now we must rise to the decisive moment to make a nation and a world well than any we have ever know the new promise of the global economy the information age unimagined new work life enhance technology all these be ours to seize that be our honor and our challenge we must be shaper of event not observer for if we do not act the moment will pass and we will lose the good possibility of our future

 we face no imminent threat but we do have an enemy the enemy of our time be inaction so tonight i issue a call to action action by this congress action by our state by our people to prepare america for the 21st century action to keep our economy and our democracy strong and work for all our people action to strengthen education and harness the force of technology and science action to build strong family and strong community and a safe environment action to keep america the world 's strong force for peace freedom and prosperity and above all action to build a more perfect union here at home

 the spirit we bring to our work will make all the difference we must be commit to the pursuit of opportunity for all americans responsibility from all americans in a community of all americans and we must be commit to a new kind of government not to solve all our problem for we but to give our people all our people the tool they need to make the most of their own life

 and we must work together the people of this nation elect we all they want we to be partner not partisan they put we all right here in the same boat they give we all oar and they tell we to row now here be the direction i believe we should take

 first we must move quickly to complete the unfinished business of our country to balance the budget renew our democracy and finish the job of welfare reform

 over the last four year we have bring new economic growth by invest in our people expand our export cut our deficit create over 11 million new job a four year record now we must keep our economy the strong in the world we here tonight have an historic opportunity let this congress be the congress that finally balance the budget thank you

 in two day i will propose a detailed plan to balance the budget by 2002 this plan will balance the budget and invest in our people while protect medicare medicaid education and the environment it will balance the budget and build on the vice president 's effort to make our government work well even as it cost less it will balance the budget and provide middle class tax relief to pay for education and health care to help to raise a child to buy and sell a home

 balance the budget require only your vote and my signature it do not require we to rewrite our constitution i believe it be both unnecessary and unwise to adopt a balanced budget amendment that could cripple our country in time of economic crisis and force unwanted result such as judge halt social security check or increase taxis let we at least agree we should not pass any measure no measure should be pass that threaten social security whatever your view on that we all must concede we do not need a constitutional amendment we need action

 whatever our difference we should balance the budget now and then for the long term health of our society we must agree to a bipartisan process to preserve social security and reform medicare for the long run so that these fundamental program will be as strong for our child as they be for our parent

 and let i say something that be not in my script tonight i know this be not go to be easy but i really believe one of the reason the american people give i a second term be to take the tough decision in the next four year that will carry our country through the next 50 year i know it be easy for i than for you to say or do but another reason i be elect be to support all of you without regard to party to give you what be necessary to join in these decision we owe it to our country and to our future

 our second piece of unfinished business require we to commit ourselves tonight before the eye of america to finally enact bipartisan campaign finance reform now senators mccain and feingold representatives shays and meehan have reach across party line here to craft tough and fair reform their proposal would curb spending reduce the role of special interest create a level playing field between challenger and incumbent and ban contribution from noncitizen all corporate source and the other large soft money contribution that both party receive

 you know and i know that this can be delay and you know and i know the delay will mean the death of reform so let us set our own deadline let us work together to write bipartisan campaign finance reform into law and pass mccain feingold by the day we celebrate the birth of our democracy july 4

 there be a third piece of unfinished business over the last four year we move a record two million people off the welfare roll then last year congress enact landmark welfare reform legislation demand that all able bodied recipient assume the responsibility of move from welfare to work now each and every one of we have to fulfill our responsibility indeed our moral obligation to make sure that people who now must work can work

 now we must act to meet a new goal two million more people off the welfare roll by the year 2000 here be my plan tax credit and other incentive for business that hire people off welfare incentive for job placement firm and state to create more job for welfare recipient training transportation and child care to help people go to work

 now i challenge every state turn those welfare check into private sector paycheck i challenge every religious congregation every community nonprofit every business to hire someone off welfare and i would like to say especially to every employer in our country who ever criticize the old welfare system you can not blame that old system anymore we have tear it down now do your part give someone on welfare the chance to go to work

 tonight i be pleased to announce that five major corporation sprint monsanto ups burger king and united airlines will be the first to join in a new national effort to marshal america 's business large and small to create job so that people can move from welfare to work

 we pass welfare reform all of you know i believe we be right to do it but no one can walk out of this chamber with a clear conscience unless you be prepared to finish the job

 and we must join together to do something else too something both republican and democratic governors have ask we to do to restore basic health and disability benefit when misfortune strike immigrant who come to this country legally who work hard pay taxis and obey the law to do otherwise be simply unworthy of a great nation of immigrant

 now look ahead the great step of all the high threshold of the future we must now cross and my number one priority for the next four year be to ensure that all americans have the good education in the world

 let us work together to meet these three goal every 8 year old must be able to read every 12 year old must be able to log on to the internet every 18 year old must be able to go to college and every adult american must be able to keep on learn for a lifetime

 my balanced budget make an unprecedented commitment to these goal $ 51 billion next year but far more than money be require i have a plan a call to action for american education base on these 10 principle

 first a national crusade for education standard not federal government standard but national standard represent what all our student must know to succeed in the knowledge economy of the 21st century every state and school must shape the curriculum to reflect these standard and train teacher to lift student up to they to help school meet the standard and measure their progress we will lead an effort over the next two year to develop national test of student achievement in reading and math tonight i issue a challenge to the nation every state should adopt high national standard and by 1999 every state should test every 4th grader in reading and every 8th grader in math to make sure these standard be meet

 raising standard will not be easy and some of our child will not be able to meet they at first the point be not to put our child down but to lift they up good test will show we who need help what change in teaching to make and which school need to improve they can help we end social promotion for no child should move from grade school to junior high or junior high to high school until he or she be ready

 last month our secretary of education dick riley and i visit northern illinois where eighth grade student from 20 school district in a project aptly call first in the world take the third international math and science study that be a test that reflect the world class standard our child must meet for the new era and those student in illinois tie for first in the world in science and come in second in math two of they kristen tanner and chris getsler be here tonight along with their teacher sue winski they be up there with the first lady and they prove that when we aim high and challenge our student they will be the good in the world let us give they a hand stand up please

 second to have the good school we must have the good teacher most of we in this chamber would not be here tonight without the help of those teacher i know that i would not be here for year many of our educator lead by north carolina 's governor jim hunt and the national board for professional teaching standards have work very hard to establish nationally accept credential for excellence in teaching just 500 of these teacher have be certify since 1995 my budget will enable 100,000 more to seek national certification as master teacher we should reward and recognize our good teacher and as we reward they we should quickly and fairly remove those few who do not measure up and we should challenge more of our fine young people to consider teaching as a career

 third we must do more to help all our child read forty percent—40 percent of our 8 year old can not read on their own that be why we have just launch the america reads initiative to build a citizen army of one million volunteer tutor to make sure every child can read independently by the end of the third grade we will use thousand of americorps volunteer to mobilize this citizen army we want at least 100,000 college student to help and tonight i be pleased that 60 college president have answer my call pledge that thousand of their work study student will serve for one year as read tutor this be also a challenge to every teacher and every principal you must use these tutor to help student read and it be especially a challenge to our parent you must read with your child every night

 this lead to the fourth principle learning begin in the first day of life scientist be now discover how young child develop emotionally and intellectually from their very first day and how important it be for parent to begin immediately talk singe even read to their infant the first lady have spend year write about this issue study it and she and i be go to convene a white house conference on early learning and the brain this spring to explore how parent and educator can well use these startling new finding

 we already know we should start teach child before they start school that be why this balanced budget expand head start to one million child by 2002 and that be why the vice president and mrs. gore will host their annual family conference this june on what we can do to make sure that parent be an active part of their child 's learn all the way through school

 they have do a great deal to highlight the importance of family in our life and now they be turn their attention to get more parent involve in their child 's learn all the way through school and i thank you mr. vice president and i thank you especially tipper for what you do

 fifth every state should give parent the power to choose the right public school for their child their right to choose will foster competition and innovation that can make public school well we should also make it possible for more parent and teacher to start charter school school that set and meet the high standard and exist only as long as they do our plan will help america to create 3,000 of these charter school by the next century nearly seven time as there be in the country today so that parent will have even more choice in send their child to the good school

 sixth character education must be teach in our school we must teach our child to be good citizen and we must continue to promote order and discipline support community that introduce school uniform impose curfew enforce truancy law remove disruptive student from the classroom and have zero tolerance for gun and drug in school

 seventh we can not expect our child to raise themselves up in school that be literally fall down with the student population at an all time high and record number of school building fall into disrepair this have now become a serious national concern therefore my budget include a new initiative $ 5 billion to help community finance $ 20 billion in school construction over the next four year

 eighth we must make the 13th and 14th year of education at least two year of college just as universal in america by the 21st century as a high school education be today and we must open the door of college to all americans to do that i propose america 's hope scholarship base on georgia 's pioneering program two year of a $ 1,500 tax credit for college tuition enough to pay for the typical community college i also propose a tax deduction of up to $ 10,000 a year for all tuition after high school an expand ira you can withdraw from tax free for education and the large increase in pell grant scholarship in 20 year now this plan will give most family the ability to pay no taxis on money they save for college tuition i ask you to pass it and give every american who work hard the chance to go to college

 ninth in the 21st century we must expand the frontier of learn across a lifetime all our people of whatever age must have the chance to learn new skill most americans live near a community college the road that take they there can be path to a well future my gi bill for america 's worker will transform the confusing tangle of federal training program into a simple skill grant to go directly into eligible worker hand for too long this bill have be sit on that desk there without action i ask you to pass it now let us give more of our worker the ability to learn and to earn for a lifetime

 tenth we must bring the power of the information age into all our school last year i challenge america to connect every classroom and library to the internet by the year 2000 so that for the first time in our history child in the most isolated rural town the most comfortable suburb the poor inner city school will have the same access to the same universe of knowledge

 that be my plan a call to action for american education some may say that it be unusual for a president to pay this kind of attention to education some may say it be simply because the president and his wonderful wife have be obsess with this subject for more year than they can recall that be not what be drive these proposal

 we must understand the significance of this endeavor one of the great source of our strength throughout the cold war be a bipartisan foreign policy because our future be at stake politic stop at the water 's edge now i ask you and i ask all our nation 's governor i ask parent teacher and citizen all across america for a new nonpartisan commitment to education because education be a critical national security issue for our future and politic must stop at the schoolhouse door

 to prepare america for the 21st century we must harness the powerful force of science and technology to benefit all americans this be the first state of the union carry live in video over the internet but we have only begin to spread the benefit of a technology revolution that should become the modern birthright of every citizen

 our effort to connect every classroom be just the beginning now we should connect every hospital to the internet so that doctor can instantly share datum about their patient with the good specialist in the field and i challenge the private sector tonight to start by connect every child 's hospital as soon as possible so that a child in bed can stay in touch with school family and friend a sick child need no long be a child alone

 we must build the second generation of the internet so that our lead university and national laboratory can communicate in speed 1,000 time fast than today to develop new medical treatment new source of energy new way of work together

 but we can not stop there as the internet become our new town square a computer in every home a teacher of all subject a connection to all culture this will no long be a dream but a necessity and over the next decade that must be our goal

 we must continue to explore the heaven press on with the mars probe and the international space station both of which will have practical application for our everyday living

 we must speed the remarkable advance in medical science the human genome project be now decode the genetic mystery of life american scientist have discover gene link to breast cancer and ovarian cancer and medication that stop a stroke in progress and begin to reverse its effect and treatment that dramatically lengthen the life of people with hiv and aids

 since i take office fund for aids research at the national institutes of health have increase dramatically to $ 1.5 billion with new resource nih will now become the most powerful discovery engine for an aids vaccine work with other scientist to finally end the threat of aids remember that every year every year we move up the discovery of an aids vaccine will save million of life around the world we must reinforce our commitment to medical science

 to prepare america for the 21st century we must build strong family over the past four year the family and medical leave law have help million of americans to take time off to be with their family with new pressure on people in the way they work and live i believe we must expand family leave so that worker can take time off for teacher conference and a child 's medical checkup we should pass flex time so worker can choose to be pay for overtime in income or trade it in for time off to be with their family

 we must continue step by step to give more family access to affordable quality health care forty million americans still lack health insurance ten million child still lack health insurance 80 percent of they have work parent who pay taxis that be wrong my balanced budget will extend health coverage to up to five million of those child since nearly half of all child who lose their insurance do so because their parent lose or change a job my budget will also ensure that people who temporarily lose their job can still afford to keep their health insurance no child should be without a doctor just because a parent be without a job

 my medicare plan modernize medicare increase the life of the trust fund to 10 year provide support for respite care for the many family with love one afflict with alzheimer 's and for the first time it would fully pay for annual mammogram

 just as we end drive through delivery of baby last year we must now end the dangerous and demeaning practice of force woman home from the hospital only hour after a mastectomy i ask your support for bipartisan legislation to guarantee that a woman can stay in the hospital for 48 hour after a mastectomy with we tonight be dr. kristen zarfos a connecticut surgeon whose outrage at this practice spur a national movement and inspire this legislation i would like she to stand so we can thank she for her effort dr. zarfos thank you applause

 in the last four year we have increase child support collection by 50 percent now we should go far and do well by make it a felony for any parent to cross a state line in an attempt to flee from this his or her most sacred obligation

 finally we must also protect our child by stand firm in our determination to ban the advertising and marketing of cigarette that endanger their life

 to prepare america for the 21st century we must build strong community we should start with safe street serious crime have drop five year in a row the key have be community policing we must finish the job of put 100,000 community police on the street of the united states we should pass the victim right amendment to the constitution and i ask you to mount a full scale assault on juvenile crime with legislation that declare war on gang with new prosecutor and tough penalty extend the brady bill so violent teen criminal will not be able to buy handgun require child safety lock on handgun to prevent unauthorized use and help to keep our school open after hour on weekend and in the summer so our young people will have someplace to go and something to say yes to

 this balanced budget include the large antidrug effort ever to stop drug at their source punish those who push they and teach our young people that drug be wrong drug be illegal and drug will kill they i hope you will support it

 our grow economy have help to revive poor urban and rural neighborhood but we must do more to empower they to create the condition in which all family can flourish and to create job through investment by business and loan by bank we should double the number of empowerment zone they have already bring so much hope to community like detroit where the unemployment rate have be cut in half in four year we should restore contaminate urban land and building to productive use we should expand the network of community development bank and together we must pledge tonight that we will use this empowerment approach include private sector tax incentive to renew our capital city so that washington be a great place to work and live and once again the proud face america show the world

 we must protect our environment in every community in the last four year we clean up 250 toxic waste site as many as in the previous 12 now we should clean up 500 more so that our child grow up next to park not poison i urge you to pass my proposal to make big polluter live by a simple rule if you pollute our environment you should pay to clean it up

 in the last four year we strengthen our nation 's safe food and clean drinking water law we protect some of america 's rare most beautiful land in utah 's red rocks region create three new national park in the california desert and begin to restore the florida everglades now we must be as vigilant with our river as we be with our land tonight i announce that this year i will designate 10 american heritage rivers to help community alongside they revitalize their waterfront and clean up pollution in the river prove once again that we can grow the economy as we protect the environment

 we must also protect our global environment work to ban the bad toxic chemical and to reduce the greenhouse gas that challenge our health even as they change our climate

 now we all know that in all of our community some of our child simply do not have what they need to grow and learn in their own home or school or neighborhood and that mean the rest of we must do more for they be our child too that be why president bush general colin powell former housing secretary henry cisneros will join the vice president and i to lead the president 's summit of service in philadelphia in april

 our national service program americorps have already help 70,000 young people to work their way through college as they serve america now we intend to mobilize million of americans to serve in thousand of way citizen service be an american responsibility which all americans should embrace and i ask your support for that endeavor

 i would like to make just one last point about our national community our economy be measure in number and statistic and it be very important but the endure worth of our nation lie in our share value and our soar spirit so instead of cut back on our modest effort to support the art and humanity i believe we should stand by they and challenge our artist musician and writer challenge our museum library and theater we should challenge all americans in the art and humanity to join with our fellow citizen to make the year 2000 a national celebration of the american spirit in every community a celebration of our common culture in the century that have pass and in the new one to come in the new millennium so that we can remain in the world 's beacon not only of liberty but of creativity long after the firework have fade

 to prepare america for the 21st century we must master the force of change in the world and keep american leadership strong and sure for an uncharted time

 fifty year ago a farsighte america lead in create the institution that secure victory in the cold war and build a grow world economy as a result today more people than ever embrace our ideal and share our interest already we have dismantle many of the bloc and barrier that divide our parent world for the first time more people live under democracy than dictatorship include every nation in our own hemisphere but one and its day too will come

 now we stand at another moment of change and choice and another time to be farsighte to bring america 50 more year of security and prosperity in this endeavor our first task be to help to build for the very first time an undivided democratic europe when europe be stable prosperous and at peace america be more secure to that end we must expand nato by 1999 so that country that be once our adversary can become our ally at the special nato summit this summer that be what we will begin to do we must strengthen nato 's partnership for peace with non member ally and we must build a stable partnership between nato and a democratic russia an expand nato be good for america and a europe in which all democracy define their future not in term of what they can do to each other but in term of what they can do together for the good of all that kind of europe be good for america

 second america must look to the east no less than to the west our security demand it americans fight three war in asia in this century our prosperity require it more than two million american job depend upon trade with asia

 there too we be help to shape an asia pacific community of cooperation not conflict let our progress there not mask the peril that remain together with south korea we must advance peace talk with north korea and bridge the cold war 's last divide and i call on congress to fund our share of the agreement under which north korea must continue to freeze and then dismantle its nuclear weapon program

 we must pursue a deep dialogue with china for the sake of our interest and our ideal an isolated china be not good for america a china play its proper role in the world be i will go to china and i have invite china 's president to come here not because we agree on everything but because engage china be the good way to work on our common challenge like end nuclear testing and to deal frankly with our fundamental difference like human right

 the american people must prosper in the global economy we have work hard to tear down trade barrier abroad so that we can create good job at home i be proud to say that today america be once again the most competitive nation and the number one exporter in the world

 now we must act to expand our export especially to asia and latin america two of the fast grow region on earth or be leave behind as these emerge economy forge new tie with other nation that be why we need the authority now to conclude new trade agreement that open market to our good and service even as we preserve our value

 we need not shrink from the challenge of the global economy after all we have the good worker and the good product in a truly open market we can out compete anyone anywhere on earth

 but this be about more than economic by expand trade we can advance the cause of freedom and democracy around the world there be no well example of this truth than latin america where democracy and open market be on the march together that be why i will visit there in the spring to reinforce our important tie

 we should all be proud that america lead the effort to rescue our neighbor mexico from its economic crisis and we should all be proud that last month mexico repay the united states three full year ahead of schedule with half a billion dollar profit to we

 america must continue to be an unrelenting force for peace from the middle east to haiti from northern ireland to africa take reasonable risk for peace keep we from be draw into far more costly conflict later

 with american leadership the killing have stop in bosnia now the habit of peace must take hold the new nato force will allow reconstruction and reconciliation to accelerate tonight i ask congress to continue its strong support of our troop they be do a remarkable job there for america and america must do right by they

 fifth we must move strongly against new threat to our security in the past four year we agree to ban we lead the way to a worldwide agreement to ban nuclear testing with russia we dramatically cut nuclear arsenal and we stop target each other citizen we be act to prevent nuclear material from fall into the wrong hand and to rid the world of landmine we be work with other nation with renew intensity to fight drug trafficker and to stop terrorist before they act and hold they fully accountable if they do

 now we must rise to a new test of leadership ratify the chemical weapons convention make no mistake about it it will make our troop safe from chemical attack it will help we to fight terrorism we have no more important obligation especially in the wake of what we now know about the gulf war this treaty have be bipartisan from the beginning support by republican and democratic administration and republican and democratic members of congress and already approve by 68 nation

 but if we do not act by april 29 when this convention go into force with or without we we will lose the chance to have americans lead and enforce this effort together we must make the chemical weapons convention law so that at last we can begin to outlaw poison gas from the earth

 finally we must have the tool to meet all these challenge we must maintain a strong and ready military we must increase funding for weapon modernization by the year 2000 and we must take good care of our man and woman in uniform they be the world 's fine

 we must also renew our commitment to america 's diplomacy and pay our debt and due to international financial institution like the world bank and to a reform united nations every dollar we devote to prevent conflict to promote democracy to stop the spread of disease and starvation bring a sure return in security and saving yet international affair spending today be just one percent of the federal budget a small fraction of what america invest in diplomacy to choose leadership over escapism at the start of the cold war if america be to continue to lead the world we here who lead america simply must find the will to pay our way

 a farsighte america move the world to a well place over these last 50 year and so it can be for another 50 year but a shortsighted america will soon find its word fall on deaf ear all around the world

 almost exactly 50 year ago in the first winter of the cold war president truman stand before a republican congress and call upon our country to meet its responsibility of leadership this be his warning he say if we falter we may endanger the peace of the world and we shall surely endanger the welfare of this nation that congress lead by republicans like senator arthur vandenberg answer president truman 's call together they make the commitment that strengthen our country for 50 year now let we do the same let we do what it take to remain the indispensable nation to keep america strong secure and prosperous for another 50 year

 in the end more than anything else our world leadership grow out of the power of our example here at home out of our ability to remain strong as one america

 all over the world people be be tear asunder by racial ethnic and religious conflict that fuel fanaticism and terror we be the world 's most diverse democracy and the world look to we to show that it be possible to live and advance together across those kind of difference

 america have always be a nation of immigrant from the start a steady stream of people in search of freedom and opportunity have leave their own land to make this land their home we start as an experiment in democracy fuel by europeans we have grow into an experiment in democratic diversity fuel by openness and promise

 my fellow americans we must never ever believe that our diversity be a weakness it be our great strength american speak every language know every country people on every continent can look to we and see the reflection of their own great potential and they always will as long as we strive to give all of our citizen whatever their background an opportunity to achieve their own greatness

 we be not there yet we still see evidence of abide bigotry and intolerance in ugly word and awful violence in burn church and bomb building we must fight against this in our country and in our heart

 just a few day before my second inauguration one of our country 's well know pastor reverend robert schuller suggest that i read isaiah 58:12 here be what it say thou shalt raise up the foundation of many generation and thou shalt be call the repairer of the breach the restorer of path to dwell in i place my hand on that verse when i take the oath of office on behalf of all americans for no matter what our difference in our faith our background our politic we must all be repairer of the breach

 tomorrow in the state of the union address i will spell out what we seek to do on behalf of our child to prepare they for the 21st century but i want to talk a little bit about education today and about this announcement in that context
 education must be our nation 's high priority last year in the state of the union address i set out a 10 point plan to move we forward and urge the american people to make sure that politic stop at the schoolhouse door well we have make a lot of progress on that 10 point plan a remarkable a remarkable array of initiative to open the door of college to every american who be willing to work for it strong progress toward high national standard in the basic the america reads challenge to teach every 8 year old to read continue progress in the vice president 's program to hook up all of our classroom and library to the internet by the year 2000
 this have be the most important year in a generation for education reform tomorrow i will set out the next step on our continue road
 first i will propose the first ever national effort to reduce class size in the early grade hillary and i work very hard 15 year ago now to have very strict class size at home in the early grade and it be quite controversial and i think enormously beneficial when we do it our balanced budget will help to hire 100,000 teacher who must pass state competency test but who will be able to reduce class size in the first second and third grade to an average of 18 nationwide
 second since there be more student and there will be more teacher there must be more classroom so i will propose a school construction tax cut to help community modernize and build new school
 third i will promote a national effort to help school that follow the lead of the chicago system in end social promotion but help student with summer school and other program to give they the tool they need to get ahead
 all these step will help our child get the future they deserve and that be why what we be announce here be so important as well
 every child need someplace to go after school with after school program we can not only keep our kid healthy and happy and safe we can help to teach they to say no to drug alcohol and crime yes to read sport and computer my balanced budget plan include a national initiative to spark private sector and local community effort to provide after school care as the secretary of education say to half a million more child
 now let i say in addition to all the positive benefit i think it be important to point out that the hour between 3 and 7 at night be the most vulnerable hour for young people to get in trouble for juvenile crime there be this sort of assumption that everybody that get in trouble when they be young have just already be abandon that be not true most of the kid that get in trouble get in trouble after school close and before their parent get home from work so in the adolescent year in the later year it be profoundly important to try to give kid something to say yes to and something positive to do
 but we can not do it alone as i say our plan involve a public private partnership so it have fall to i to announce that our distinguished guest from the mott foundation of flint michigan have pledge up to $ 55 million to help ensure that after school program support by federal fund be of the high quality that be an astonishing gift thank you bill white thank you
 we be determined to help americans succeed in the workplace to raise well educate healthy kid and to help americans succeed at the tough job of all that of be a parent and the mott foundation have go a long way toward help we i thank they
 now i have to go back to work on my state of the union speech and i work on it until pretty late last night but i want to say one thing to the american people i want you to listen to i i be go to say this again i do not have sexual relation with that woman miss lewinsky i never tell anybody to lie not a single time never these allegation be false and i need to go back to work for the american people
 thank you

mr. speaker mr. vice president member of the 105th congress distinguished guest my fellow americans since the last time we meet in this chamber america have lose two patriot and fine public servant though they sit on opposite side of the aisle representatives walter capps and sonny bono share a deep love for this house and an unshakable commitment to improve the life of all our people in the past few week they have both be eulogize tonight i think we should begin by send a message to their family and their friend that we celebrate their life and give thank for their service to our nation
 for 209 year it have be the president 's duty to report to you on the state of the union because of the hard work and high purpose of the american people these be good time for america we have more than 14 million new job the low unemployment in 24 year the low core inflation in 30 year income be rise and we have the high homeownership in history crime have drop for a record five year in a row and the welfare roll be at their low level in 27 year our leadership in the world be unrivale lady and gentleman the state of our union be strong
 but with barely 700 day leave in the 20th century this be not a time to rest it be a time to build to build the america within reach an america where everybody have a chance to get ahead with hard work where every citizen can live in a safe community where family be strong school be good and all our young people can go on to college an america where scientist find cure for disease from diabete to alzheimer 's to aids an america where every child can stretch a hand across a keyboard and reach every book ever write every painting ever paint every symphony ever compose where government provide opportunity and citizen honor the responsibility to give something back to their community an america which lead the world to new height of peace and prosperity this be the america we have begin to build this be the america we can leave to our child if we join together to finish the work at hand let we strengthen our nation for the 21st century
 rarely have americans live through so much change in so many way in so short a time quietly but with gathering force the ground have shift beneath our foot as we have move into an information age a global economy a truly new world for five year now we have meet the challenge of these change as americans have at every turning point in our history by renew the very idea of america widen the circle of opportunity deepen the meaning of our freedom forge a more perfect union
 we shape a new kind of government for the information age i thank the vice president for his leadership and the congress for its support in build a government that be lean more flexible a catalyst for new idea and most of all a government that give the american people the tool they need to make the most of their own life
 we have move past the sterile debate between those who say government be the enemy and those who say government be the answer my fellow americans we have find a third way we have the small government in 35 year but a more progressive one we have a small government but a strong nation we be move steadily toward an even strong america in the 21st century an economy that offer opportunity a society root in responsibility and a nation that live as a community
 first americans in this chamber and across our nation have pursue a new strategy for prosperity fiscal discipline to cut interest rate and spur growth investment in education and skill in science and technology and transportation to prepare our people for the new economy new market for american product and american worker
 when i take office the deficit for 1998 be project to be $ 357 billion and head higher this year our deficit be project to be $ 10 billion and head low for three decade six president have come before you to warn of the damage deficit pose to our nation tonight i come before you to announce that the federal deficit once so incomprehensibly large that it have 11 zero will be simply zero i will submit to congress for 1999 the first balanced budget in 30 year and if we hold fast to fiscal discipline we may balance the budget this year four year ahead of schedule
 you can all be proud of that because turn a sea of red ink into black be no miracle it be the product of hard work by the american people and of two visionary action in congress the courageous vote in 1993 that lead to a cut in the deficit of 90 percent and the truly historic bipartisan balanced budget agreement pass by this congress here be the really good news if we maintain our resolve we will produce balanced budget as far as the eye can see
 we must not go back to unwise spending or untargeted tax cut that risk reopen the deficit last year together we enact targeted tax cut so that the typical middle class family will now have the low tax rate in 20 year my plan to balance the budget next year include both new investment and new tax cut target to the need of work family for education for child care for the environment
 but whether the issue be tax cut or spending i ask all of you to meet this test approve only those priority that can actually be accomplish without add a dime to the deficit
 now if we balance the budget for next year it be project that we will then have a sizable surplus in the year that immediately follow what should we do with this project surplus i have a simple four word answer save social security first applause thank you
 tonight i propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus that be every penny of any surplus until we have take all the necessary measure to strengthen the social security system for the 21st century let we say to all americans watch tonight whether you be 70 or 50 or whether you just start pay into the system social security will be there when you need it let we make this commitment social security first let us do that together
 i also want to say that all the american people who be watch we tonight should be invite to join in this discussion in face these issue squarely and form a true consensus on how we should proceed we will start by conduct nonpartisan forum in every region of the country and i hope that lawmaker of both party will participate we will hold a white house conference on social security in december and one year from now i will convene the leader of congress to craft historic bipartisan legislation to achieve a landmark for our generation a social security system that be strong in the 21st century applause thank you
 in an economy that honor opportunity all americans must be able to reap the reward of prosperity because these time be good we can afford to take one simple sensible step to help million of worker struggle to provide for their family we should raise the minimum wage
 the information age be first and foremost an education age in which education must start at birth and continue throughout a lifetime last year from this podium i say that education have to be our high priority i lay out a 10 point plan to move we forward and urge all of we to let politic stop at the schoolhouse door since then this congress across party line and the american people have respond in the most important year for education in a generation expand public school choice open the way to 3,000 new charter school work to connect every classroom in the country to the information superhighway commit to expand head start to a million child launch america reads send literally thousand of college student into our elementary school to make sure all our 8 year old can read
 last year i propose and you pass 220,000 new pell grant scholarship for deserve student student loan already less expensive and easy to repay now you get to deduct the interest family all over america now can put their saving into new tax free education ira and this year for the first two year of college family will get a $ 1,500 tax credit a hope scholarship that will cover the cost of most community college tuition and for junior and senior year graduate school and job training there be a lifetime learning credit you do that and you should be very proud of it
 and because of these action i have something to say to every family listen to we tonight your child can go on to college if you know a child from a poor family tell she not to give up she can go on to college if you know a young couple struggle with bill worry they will not be able to send their child to college tell they not to give up their child can go on to college if you know somebody who be catch in a dead end job and afraid he can not afford the class necessary to get well job for the rest of his life tell he not to give up he can go on to college because of the thing that have be do we can make college as universal in the 21st century as high school be today and my friend that will change the face and future of america
 we have open wide the door of the world 's good system of high education now we must make our public elementary and secondary school the world 's good as well by raise standard raise expectation and raise accountability thank to the action of this congress last year we will soon have for the very first time a voluntary national test base on national standard in fourth grade reading and eighth grade math parent have a right to know whether their child be master the basic and every parent already know the key good teacher and small class
 tonight i propose the first ever national effort to reduce class size in the early grade applause thank you my balanced budget will help to hire 100,000 new teacher who have pass a state competency test now with these teacher listen with these teacher we will actually be able to reduce class size in the first second and third grade to an average of 18 student a class all across america
 if i have get the math right more teacher teach small class require more classroom so i also propose a school construction tax cut to help community modernize or build 5,000 school
 we must also demand great accountability when we promote a child from grade to grade who have not master the work we do not do that child any favor it be time to end social promotion in america 's school last year in chicago they make that decision not to hold our child back but to lift they up chicago stop social promotion and start mandatory summer school to help student who be behind to catch up i propose to help other community follow chicago 's lead let us say to they stop promote child who do not learn and we will give you the tool to make sure they do
 i also ask this congress to support our effort to enlist college and university to reach out to disadvantaged child start in the sixth grade so that they can get the guidance and hope they need so they can know that they too will be able to go on to college
 as we enter the 21st century the global economy require we to seek opportunity not just at home but in all the market of the world we must shape this global economy not shrink from it in the last five year we have lead the way in open new market with 240 trade agreement that remove foreign barrier to product bear the proud stamp make in the usa today record high export account for fully one third of our economic growth i want to keep they go because that be the way to keep america grow and to advance a safe more stable world
 all of you know whatever your view be that i think this be a great opportunity for america i know there be opposition to more comprehensive trade agreement i have listen carefully and i believe that the opposition be root in two fear first that our trading partner will have low environmental and labor standard which will give they an unfair advantage in our market and do their own people no favor even if there be more business and second that if we have more trade more of our worker will lose their job and have to start over i think we should seek to advance worker and environmental standard around the world i have make it abundantly clear that it should be a part of our trade agenda but we can not influence other country decision if we send they a message that we be back away from trade with they
 this year i will send legislation to congress and ask other nation to join we to fight the most intolerable labor practice of all abusive child labor we should also offer help and hope to those americans temporarily leave behind by the global marketplace or by the march of technology which may have nothing to do with trade that be why we have more than double funding for train dislocate worker since 1993 and if my new budget be adopt we will triple funding that be why we must do more and more quickly to help worker who lose their job for whatever reason
 you know we help community in a special way when their military base close we ought to help they in the same way if their factory close again i ask the congress to continue its bipartisan work to consolidate the tangle of training program we have today into one single gi bill for worker a simple skill grant so people can on their own move quickly to new job to high income and bright future
 we all know in every way in life change be not always easy but we have to decide whether we be go to try to hold it back and hide from it or reap its benefit and remember the big picture here while we have be enter into hundred of new trade agreement we have be create million of new job
 so this year we will forge new partnership with latin america asia and europe and we should pass the new african trade act it have bipartisan support i will also renew my request for the fast track negotiating authority necessary to open more new market create more new job which every president have have for two decade
 you know whether we like it or not in way that be mostly positive the world 's economy be more and more interconnected and interdependent today an economic crisis anywhere can affect economy everywhere recent month have bring serious financial problem to thailand indonesia south korea and beyond
 now why should americans be concern about this first these country be our customer if they sink into recession they will not be able to buy the good we would like to sell they second they be also our competitor so if their currency lose their value and go down then the price of their good will drop flood our market and other with much cheap good which make it a lot tough for our people to compete and finally they be our strategic partner their stability bolster our security
 the american economy remain sound and strong and i want to keep it that way but because the turmoil in asia will have an impact on all the world 's economy include our make that negative impact as small as possible be the right thing to do for america and the right thing to do for a safe world
 our policy be clear no nation can recover if it do not reform itself but when nation be willing to undertake serious economic reform we should help they do it so i call on congress to renew america 's commitment to the international monetary fund and i think we should say to all the people we be try to represent here that prepare for a far off storm that may reach our shore be far wise than ignore the thunder till the cloud be just overhead
 a strong nation rest on the rock of responsibility a society root in responsibility must first promote the value of work not welfare we can be proud that after decade of finger pointing and failure together we end the old welfare system and we be now replace welfare check with paycheck
 last year after a record four year decline in welfare roll i challenge our nation to move two million more americans off welfare by the year 2000 i be pleased to report we have also meet that goal two full year ahead of schedule
 this be a grand achievement the sum of many act of individual courage persistence and hope for 13 year elaine kinslow of indianapolis indiana be on and off welfare today she be a dispatcher with a van company she be save enough money to move her family into a good neighborhood and she be help other welfare recipient go to work elaine kinslow and all those like she be the real hero of the welfare revolution there be million like she all across america and i be happy she could join the first lady tonight elaine we be very proud of you please stand up applause
 we still have a lot more to do all of we to make welfare reform a success provide child care help family move close to available job challenge more company to join our welfare to work partnership increase child support collection from deadbeat parent who have a duty to support their own child i also want to thank congress for restore some of the benefit to immigrant who be here legally and work hard and i hope you will finish that job this year
 we have to make it possible for all hard work family to meet their most important responsibility two year ago we help guarantee that americans can keep their health insurance when they change job last year we extend health care to up to five million child this year i challenge congress to take the next historic step
 a hundred and sixty million of our fellow citizen be in manage care plan these plan save money and they can improve care but medical decision ought to be make by medical doctor not insurance company accountant i urge this congress to reach across the aisle and write into law a consumer bill of right that say this you have the right to know all your medical option not just the cheap you have the right to choose the doctor you want for the care you need you have the right to emergency room care wherever and whenever you need it you have the right to keep your medical record confidential traditional care or manage care every american deserve quality care
 millions of americans between the age of 55 and 65 have lose their health insurance some be retire some be lay off some lose their coverage when their spouse retire after a lifetime of work they be leave with nowhere to turn so i ask the congress let these hard work americans buy into the medicare system it will not add a dime to the deficit but the peace of mind it will provide will be priceless
 next we must help parent protect their child from the grave health threat that they face an epidemic of teen smoking spread by multimillion dollar marketing campaign i challenge congress let us pass bipartisan comprehensive legislation that will improve public health protect our tobacco farmer and change the way tobacco company do business forever let us do what it take to bring teen smoking down let us raise the price of cigarette by up to a dollar and a half a pack over the next 10 year with penalty on the tobacco industry if it keep marketing to our child tomorrow like every day 3,000 child will start smoking and 1,000 will die early as a result let this congress be remember as the congress that save their life
 in the new economy most parent work hard than ever they face a constant struggle to balance their obligation to be good worker and their even more important obligation to be good parent the family and medical leave act be the very first bill i be privileged to sign into law as president in 1993 since then about 15 million people have take advantage of it and i have meet a lot of they all across this country i ask you to extend that law to cover 10 million more worker and to give parent time off when they have to go see their child 's teacher or take they to the doctor
 child care be the next frontier we must face to enable people to succeed at home and at work last year i cohoste the very first white house conference on child care with one of our foremost expert america 's first lady from all corner of america we hear the same message without regard to region or income or political affiliation we have get to raise the quality of child care we have get to make it safe we have get to make it more affordable

 so here be my plan help family to pay for child care for a million more child scholarship and background check for child care worker and a new emphasis on early learning tax credit for business that provide child care for their employee and a large child care tax credit for work family now if you pass my plan what this mean be that a family of four with an income of $ 35,000 and high child care cost will no long pay a single penny of federal income tax
 i think this be such a big issue with i because of my own personal experience i have often wonder how my mother when she be a young widow would have be able to go away to school and get an education and come back and support i if my grandparent have not be able to take care of i she and i be really very lucky how many other family have never have that same opportunity the truth be we do not know the answer to that question but we do know what the answer should be not a single american family should ever have to choose between the job they need and the child they love

 drug use be on the decline i thank general mccaffrey for his leadership and i thank this congress for pass the large antidrug budget in history now i ask you to join i in a groundbreaking effort to hire 1,000 new border patrol agent and to deploy the most sophisticated available new technology to help close the door on drug at our border

 we must exercise responsibility not just at home but around the world on the eve of a new century we have the power and the duty to build a new era of peace and security but make no mistake about it today 's possibility be not tomorrow 's guarantee america must stand against the poison appeal of extreme nationalism we must combat an unholy axis of new threat from terrorist international criminal and drug trafficker these 21st century predator feed on technology and the free flow of information and idea and people and they will be all the more lethal if weapon of mass destruction fall into their hand

 i have a great delegation of americans with i leader of our government leader of our congress distinguish american citizen we be all very grateful to be here we thank the diplomatic corps for be here and the member of the rwandan government and especially the citizen
 i have come today to pay the respect of my nation to all who suffer and all who perish in the rwandan genocide it be my hope that through this trip in every corner of the world today and tomorrow their story will be tell that 4 year ago in this beautiful green lovely land a clear and conscious decision be make by those then in power that the people of this country would not live side by side in peace
 during the 90 day that begin on april 6 in 1994 rwanda experience the most extensive slaughter in this blood fill century we be about to leave family murder in their home people hunt down as they flee by soldier and militia through farmland and wood as if they be animal
 from kibuye in the west to kibungo in the east people gather seek refuge in church by the thousand in hospital in school and when they be find the old and the sick the woman and child alike they be kill kill because their identity card say they be tutsi or because they have a tutsi parent or because someone think they look like a tutsi or slain like thousand of hutus because they protect tutsis or would not countenance a policy that seek to wipe out people who just the day before and for year before have be their friend and neighbor
 the government lead effort to exterminate rwanda 's tutsi and moderate hutus as you know well than i take at last a million life scholar of these sort of event say that the killer arm mostly with machete and club nonetheless do their work 5 time as fast as the mechanized gas chamber use by the nazis
 it be important that the world know that these killing be not spontaneous or accidental it be important that the world hear what your president just say they be most certainly not the result of ancient tribal struggle indeed these people have live together for century before the event the president describe begin to unfold
 these event grow from a policy aim at the systematic destruction of a people the ground for violence be carefully prepare the airwave poison with hate cast the tutsis as scapegoat for the problem of rwanda deny their humanity all of this be do clearly to make it easy for otherwise reluctant people to participate in wholesale slaughter
 list of victim name by name be actually draw up in advance today the image of all that haunt we all the dead choke the kigara river float to lake victoria in their fate we be remind of the capacity for people everywhere not just in rwanda and certainly not just in africa but the capacity for people everywhere to slip into pure evil we can not abolish that capacity but we must never accept it and we know it can be overcome
 the international community together with nation in africa must bear its share of responsibility for this tragedy as well we do not act quickly enough after the killing begin we should not have allow the refugee camp to become safe haven for the killer we do not immediately call these crime by their rightful name genocide we can not change the past but we can and must do everything in our power to help you build a future without fear and full of hope
 we owe to those who die and to those who survive who love they our every effort to increase our vigilance and strengthen our stand against those who would commit such atrocity in the future here or elsewhere indeed we owe to all the people of the world who be at risk because each bloodletting hasten the next as the value of human life be degrade and violence becomes tolerate the unimaginable become more conceivable we owe to all the people in the world our good effort to organize ourselves so that we can maximize the chance of prevent these event and where they can not be prevent we can move more quickly to minimize the horror
 so let we challenge ourselves to build a world in which no branch of humanity because of national racial ethnic or religious origin be again threaten with destruction because of those characteristic of which people should rightly be proud let we work together as a community of civilized nation to strengthen our ability to prevent and if necessary to stop genocide
 to that end i be direct my administration to improve with the international community our system for identify and spotlight nation in danger of genocidal violence so that we can assure worldwide awareness of impending threat it may seem strange to you here especially the many of you who lose member of your family but all over the world there be people like i sit in office day after day after day who do not fully appreciate the depth and the speed with which you be be engulf by this unimaginable terror
 we have see too and i want to say again that genocide can occur anywhere it be not an african phenomenon and must never be view as such we have see it in industrialized europe we have see it in asia we must have global vigilance and never again must we be shy in the face of the evidence
 secondly we must as an international community have the ability to act when genocide threaten we be work to create that capacity here in the great lakes region where the memory be still fresh this afternoon in entebbe leader from central and eastern africa will meet with i to launch an effort to build a coalition to prevent genocide in this region i thank the leader who have step forward to make this commitment we hope the effort can be a model for all the world because our sacred task be to work to banish this great crime against humanity
 event here show how urgent the work be in the northwest part of your country attack by those responsible for the slaughter in 1994 continue today we must work as partner with rwanda to end this violence and allow your people to go on rebuild your life and your nation
 third we must work now to remedy the consequence of genocide the united states have provide assistance to rwanda to settle the uprooted and restart its economy but we must do more i be pleased that america will become the first nation to contribute to the new genocide survivors fund we will contribute this year $ 2 million continue our support in the year to come and urge other nation to do the same so that survivor and their community can find the care they need and the help they must have
 mr. president to you and to you mr. vice president you have show great vision in your effort to create a single nation in which all citizen can live freely and securely as you point out rwanda be a single nation before the european power meet in berlin to carve up africa america stand with you and will continue help the people of rwanda to rebuild their life and society
 you speak passionately this morning in our private meeting about the need for grassroots effort for the development project which be bridge division and clear a path to a well future we will join with you to strengthen democratic institution to broaden participation to give all rwandans a great voice in their own governance the challenge you face be great but your commitment to last reconciliation and inclusion be firm
 fourth to help ensure that those who survive in the generation to come never again suffer genocidal violence nothing be more vital than establish the rule of law there can be no place in rwanda that last without a justice system that be recognize as such
 we applaud the effort of the rwandan government to strengthen civilian and military justice system i be pleased that our great lakes justice initiative will invest $ 30 million to help create throughout the region judicial system that be impartial credible and effective in rwanda these fund will help to support court prosecutor and police military justice and cooperation at the local level
 we will also continue to pursue justice through our strong backing for the international criminal tribunal for rwanda the united states be the large contributor to this tribunal we be frustrate as you be by the delay in the tribunal 's work as we know we must do well now that administrative improvement have begin however the tribunal should expedite case through group trial and fulfill its historic mission
 we be prepared to help among other thing with witness relocation so that those who still fear can speak the truth in safety and we will support the war crime tribunal for as long as it be need to do its work until the truth be clear and justice be render
 fifth we must make it clear to all those who would commit such act in the future that they too must answer for their act and they will in rwanda we must hold accountable all those who may abuse human right whether insurgent or soldier internationally as we meet here talk be underway at the united nations to establish a permanent international criminal court rwanda and the difficulty we have have with this special tribunal underscore the need for such a court and the united states will work to see that it be create
 i know that in the face of all you have endure optimism can not come easily to any of you yet i have just speak as i say with several rwandans who survive the atrocity and just listen to they give i reason for hope you see countless story of courage around you every day as you go about your business here man and woman who survive and go on child who recover the light in their eye remind we that at the dawn of a new millennium there be only one crucial division among the people of the earth and believe i after over 5 year of deal with these problem i know it be not the division between hutu and tutsi or serb or croatian and muslim and bosnian or arab and jew or catholic and protestant in ireland or black and white it be really the line between those who embrace the common humanity we all share and those who reject it
 it be the line between those who find meaning in life through respect and cooperation and who therefore embrace someone to look down on someone to trample someone to punish and therefore embrace war it be the line between those who look to the future and those who cling to the past it be the line between those who give up their resentment and those who believe they will absolutely die if they have to release one bit grievance it be the line between those who confront every day with a clench fist and those who confront every day with an open hand that be the only line that really count when all be say and do
 to those who believe that god make each of we in his own image how could we choose the dark road when you look at those child who greet we as we get off that plane today how could anyone say they do not want those child to have a chance to have their own child to experience the joy of another morning sunrise to learn the normal lesson of life to give something back to their people when you strip it all away whether we be talk about rwanda or some other distant troubled spot the world be divide accord to how people believe they draw meaning from life
 and so i say to you though the road be hard and uncertain and there be many difficulty ahead and like every other person who wish to help i doubltless will not be able to do everything i would like to do there be thing we can do and if we set about the business of do they together you can overcome the awful burden that you have endure you can put a smile on the face of every child in this country and you can make people once again believe that they should live as people be live who be singe to we and dance for we today
 that be what we have to believe that be what i come here to say and that be what i wish for you
 thank you and god bless you

good evening this afternoon in this room from this chair i testify before the office of independent counsel and the grand jury i answer their question truthfully include question about my private life question no american citizen would ever want to answer

 still i must take complete responsibility for all my action both public and private and that be why i be speak to you tonight

 as you know in a deposition in january i be ask question about my relationship with monica lewinsky while my answer be legally accurate i do not volunteer information indeed i do have a relationship with ms. lewinsky that be not appropriate in fact it be wrong it constitute a critical lapse in judgment and a personal failure on my part for which i be solely and completely responsible

 but i tell the grand jury today and i say to you now that at no time do i ask anyone to lie to hide or destroy evidence or to take any other unlawful action

 i know that my public comment and my silence about this matter give a false impression i mislead people include even my wife i deeply regret that i can only tell you i be motivate by many factor first by a desire to protect myself from the embarrassment of my own conduct i be also very concerned about protect my family the fact that these question be be ask in a politically inspire lawsuit which have since be dismiss be a consideration too

 in addition i have real and serious concern about an independent counsel investigation that begin with private business dealing 20 year ago dealing i might add about which an independent federal agency find no evidence of any wrongdoing by i or my wife over 2 year ago the independent counsel investigation move on to my staff and friend then into my private life and now the investigation itself be under investigation this have go on too long cost too much and hurt too many innocent people

 now this matter be between i the two people i love most my wife and our daughter and our god i must put it right and i be prepared to do whatever it take to do so nothing be more important to i personally but it be private and i intend to reclaim my family life for my family it be nobody 's business but our even president have private life

 it be time to stop the pursuit of personal destruction and the prying into private life and get on with our national life our country have be distract by this matter for too long and i take my responsibility for my part in all of this this be all i can do now it be time in fact it be past time to move on we have important work to do real opportunity to seize real problem to solve real security matter to face

 and so tonight i ask you to turn away from the spectacle of the past 7 month to repair the fabric of our national discourse and to return our attention to all the challenge and all the promise of the next american century

 thank you for watch and good night

mr. speaker mr. vice president member of congress honored guest my fellow americans tonight i have the honor of report to you on the state of the union

 let i begin by salute the new speaker of the house and thank he especially tonight for extend an invitation to two guest sit in the gallery with mrs. hastert lyn gibson and wenling chestnut be the widow of the two brave capitol hill police officer who give their life to defend freedom 's house

 mr. speaker at your swearing in you ask we all to work together in a spirit of civility and bipartisanship mr. speaker let us do exactly that

 tonight i stand before you to report that america have create the long peacetime economic expansion in our history with nearly 18 million new job wage rise at more than twice the rate of inflation the high homeownership in history the small welfare roll in 30 year and the low peacetime unemployment since 1957

 for the first time in three decade the budget be balance from a deficit of $ 290 billion in 1992 we have a surplus of $ 70 billion last year and now we be on course for budget surplus for the next 25 year

 thank to the pioneer leadership of all of you we have the low violent crime rate in a quarter century and the clean environment in a quarter century america be a strong force for peace from northern ireland to bosnia to the middle east

 thank to the leadership of vice president gore we have a government for the information age once again a government that be a progressive instrument of the common good root in our old value of opportunity responsibility and community devote to fiscal responsibility determine to give our people the tool they need to make the most of their own life in the 21st century a 21st century government for 21st century america

 my fellow americans i stand before you tonight to report that the state of our union be strong

 now america be work again the promise of our future be limitless but we can not realize that promise if we allow the hum of our prosperity to lull we into complacency how we fare as a nation far into the 21st century depend upon what we do as a nation today so with our budget surplus grow our economy expand our confidence rise now be the moment for this generation to meet our historic responsibility to the 21st century

 our fiscal discipline give we an unsurpassed opportunity to address a remarkable new challenge the aging of america with the number of elderly americans set to double by 2030 the baby boom will become a senior boom so first and above all we must save social security for the 21st century

 early in this century be old mean be poor when president roosevelt create social security thousand write to thank he for eliminate what one woman call the stark terror of penniless helpless old age even today without social security half our nation 's elderly would be force into poverty

 today social security be strong but by 2013 payroll taxis will no long be sufficient to cover monthly payment by 2032 the trust fund will be exhaust and social security will be unable to pay the full benefit old americans have be promise

 the good way to keep social security a rock solid guarantee be not to make drastic cut in benefit not to raise payroll tax rate not to drain resource from social security in the name of save it instead i propose that we make the historic decision to invest the surplus to save social security

 specifically i propose that we commit 60 percent of the budget surplus for the next 15 year to social security invest a small portion in the private sector just as any private or state government pension would do this will earn a high return and keep social security sound for 55 year

 but we must aim higher we should put social security on a sound foot for the next 75 year we should reduce poverty among elderly woman who be nearly twice as likely to be poor as our other senior and we should eliminate the limit on what senior on social security can earn

 now these change will require difficult but fully achievable choice over and above the dedication of the surplus they must be make on a bipartisan basis they should be make this year so let i say to you tonight i reach out my hand to all of you in both houses in both party and ask that we join together in say to the american people we will save social security now

 now last year we wisely reserve all of the surplus until we know what it would take to save social security again i say we should not spend any of it not any of it until after social security be truly save first thing first

 second once we have save social security we must fulfill our obligation to save and improve medicare already we have extend the life of the medicare trust fund by 10 year but we should extend it for at least another decade tonight i propose that we use one out of every $ 6 in the surplus for the next 15 year to guarantee the soundness of medicare until the year 2020

 but again we should aim higher we must be willing to work in a bipartisan way and look at new idea include the upcoming report of the bipartisan medicare commission if we work together we can secure medicare for the next two decade and cover the great grow need of senior affordable prescription drug

 third we must help all americans from their first day on the job to save to invest to create wealth from its beginning americans have supplement social security with private pension and saving yet today million of people retire with little to live on other than social security american live long than ever simply must save more than ever

 therefore in addition to save social security and medicare i propose a new pension initiative for retirement security in the 21st century i propose that we use a little over 11 percent of the surplus to establish universal saving account usa account to give all americans the mean to save with these new account americans can invest as they choose and receive fund to match a portion of their saving with extra help for those least able to save usa account will help all americans to share in our nation 's wealth and to enjoy a more secure retirement i ask you to support they

 fourth we must invest in long term care i propose a tax credit of $ 1,000 for the aged ail or disabled and the family who care for they long term care will become a big and big challenge with the aging of america and we must do more to help our family deal with it

 i be bear in 1946 the first year of the baby boom i can tell you that one of the great concern of our generation be our absolute determination not to let our grow old place an intolerable burden on our child and their ability to raise our grandchild our economic success and our fiscal discipline now give we an opportunity to lift that burden from their shoulder and we should take it

 saving social security medicare create usa account this be the right way to use the surplus if we do so if we do so we will still have resource to meet critical need in education and defense and i want to point out that this proposal be fiscally sound listen to this if we set aside 60 percent of the surplus for social security and 16 percent for medicare over the next 15 year that saving will achieve the low level of publicly hold debt since right before world war i in 1917

 so with these four measure save social security strengthen medicare establish the usa account support long term care we can begin to meet our generation 's historic responsibility to establish true security for 21st century senior

 now there be more child from more diverse background in our public school than at any time in our history their education must provide the knowledge and nurture the creativity that will allow our entire nation to thrive in the new economy

 today we can say something we could not say six year ago with tax credit and more affordable student loan with more work study grant and more pell grants with education ira and the new hope scholarship tax cut that more than five million americans will receive this year we have finally open the door of college to all americans

 with our support nearly every state have set high academic standard for public school and a voluntary national test be be develop to measure the progress of our student with over $ 1 billion in discount available this year we be well on our way to our goal of connect every classroom and library to the internet

 last fall you pass our proposal to start hire 100,000 new teacher to reduce class size in the early grade now i ask you to finish the job

 you know our child be do well sat score be up math score have rise in nearly all grade but there be a problem while our 4th grader outperform their peer in other country in math and science our 8th grader be around average and our 12th grader rank near the bottom we must do well now each year the national government invest more than $ 15 billion in our public school i believe we must change the way we invest that money to support what work and to stop support what do not work

 first later this year i will send to congress a plan that for the first time hold state and school district accountable for progress and reward they for result my education accountability act will require every school district receive federal help to take the follow five step

 first all school must end social promotion no child should graduate from high school with a diploma he or she can not read we do our child no favor when we allow they to pass from grade to grade without master the material but we can not just hold student back because the system fail they so my balanced budget triple the funding for summer school and after school program to keep a million child learn

 now if you doubt this will work just look at chicago which end social promotion and make summer school mandatory for those who do not master the basic math and read score be up three year run with some of the big gain in some of the poor neighborhood it will work and we should do it

 second all state and school district must turn around their worst perform school or shut they down that be the policy establish in north carolina by governor jim hunt north carolina make the big gain in test score in the nation last year our budget include $ 200 million to help state turn around their own fail school

 third all state and school district must be hold responsible for the quality of their teacher the great majority of our teacher do a fine job but in too many school teacher do not have college major or even minor in the subject they teach new teacher should be require to pass performance exam and all teacher should know the subject they be teach this year 's balanced budget contain resource to help they reach high standard

 and to attract talented young teacher to the tough assignment i recommend a sixfold increase in our program for college scholarship for student who commit to teach in the inner city and isolate rural area and in indian community let we bring excellence in every part of america

 fourth we must empower parent with more information and more choice in too many community it be easy to get information on the quality of the local restaurant than on the quality of the local school every school district should issue report card on every school and parent should be give more choice in select their public school

 when i become president there be just one independent public charter school in all america with our support on a bipartisan basis today there be 1,100 my budget assure that early in the next century there will be 3,000

 fifth to assure that our classroom be truly place of learn and to respond to what teacher have be ask we to do for year we should say that all state and school district must both adopt and implement sensible discipline policy

 now let us do one more thing for our child today too many school be so old they be fall apart or so overcrowded student be learn in trailer last fall congress miss the opportunity to change that this year with 53 million child in our school congress must not miss that opportunity again i ask you to help our community build or modernize 5,000 school

 if we do these thing end social promotion turn around fail school build modern one support qualified teacher promote innovation competition and discipline then we will begin to meet our generation 's historic responsibility to create 21st century school

 now we also have to do more to support the million of parent who give their all every day at home and at work the most basic tool of all be a decent income so let us raise the minimum wage by a dollar an hour over the next two year and let us make sure that woman and man get equal pay for equal work by strengthen enforcement of equal pay law

 that be encouraging you know laughter there be more balance on the seesaw i like that let us give they a hand that be great applause

 work parent also need quality child care so again this year i ask congress to support our plan for tax credit and subsidy for working family for improved safety and quality for expand after school program and our plan also include a new tax credit for stay at home parent too they need support as well

 parent should never have to worry about choose between their child and their work now the family and medical leave act the very first bill i sign into law have now since 1993 help million and million of americans to care for a newborn baby or an ail relative without risk their job i think it be time with all the evidence that it have be so little burdensome to employer to extend family leave to 10 million more americans work for small company and i hope you will support it

 finally on the matter of work parent should never have to face discrimination in the workplace so i want to ask congress to prohibit company from refuse to hire or promote worker simply because they have child that be not right

 america 's family deserve the world 's good medical care thank to bipartisan federal support for medical research we be now on the verge of new treatment to prevent or delay disease from parkinson 's to alzheimer 's to arthritis to cancer but as we continue our advance in medical science we can not let our medical system lag behind manage care have literally transform medicine in america drive down cost but threaten to drive down quality as well

 i think we ought to say to every american you should have the right to know all your medical option not just the cheap if you need a specialist you should have a right to see one you have a right to the near emergency care if you be in an accident these be thing that we ought to say and i think we ought to say you should have a right to keep your doctor during a period of treatment whether it be a pregnancy or a chemotherapy treatment or anything else i believe this

 now i have order these right to be extend to the 85 million americans serve by medicare medicaid and other federal health program but only congress can pass a patient bill of rights for all americans now last year congress miss that opportunity and we must not miss that opportunity again for the sake of our family i ask we to join together across party line and pass a strong enforceable patient bill of rights

 as more of our medical record be store electronically the threat to all our privacy increase because congress have give i the authority to act if it do not do so by august one way or another we can all say to the american people we will protect the privacy of medical record and we will do it this year

 now two year ago the congress extend health coverage to up to five million child now we should go beyond that we should make it easy for small business to offer health insurance we should give people between the age of 55 and 65 who lose their health insurance the chance to buy into medicare and we should continue to ensure access to family planning

 no one should have to choose between keep health care and take a job and therefore i especially ask you tonight to join hand to pass the landmark bipartisan legislation propose by senators kennedy and jeffords roth and moynihan to allow people with disability to keep their health insurance when they go to work

 we need to enable our public hospital our community our university health center to provide basic affordable care for all the million of work family who do not have any insurance they do a lot of that today but much more can be do and my balanced budget make a good down payment toward that goal i hope you will think about they and support that provision

 let i say we must step up our effort to treat and prevent mental illness no american should ever be afraid ever to address this disease this year we will host a white house conference on mental health with sensitivity commitment and passion tipper gore be lead our effort here and i would like to thank she for what she be do thank you applause thank you

 as everyone know our child be target of a massive medium campaign to hook they on cigarette now i ask this congress to resist the tobacco lobby to reaffirm the fda 's authority to protect our child from tobacco and to hold tobacco company accountable while protect tobacco farmer

 smoking have cost taxpayer hundred of billion of dollar under medicare and other program you know the state have be right about this taxpayer should not pay for the cost of lung cancer emphysema and other smoking relate illness the tobacco company should so tonight i announce that the justice department be prepare a litigation plan to take the tobacco company to court and with the fund we recover to strengthen medicare

 now if we act in these area minimum wage family leave child care health care the safety of our child then we will begin to meet our generation 's historic responsibility to strengthen our family for the 21st century

 today america be the most dynamic competitive job create economy in history but we can do even well in build a 21st century economy that embrace all americans

 today 's income gap be largely a skill gap last year the congress pass a law enable worker to get a skill grant to choose the training they need and i applaud all of you here who be part of that this year i recommend a five year commitment to the new system so that we can provide over the next five year appropriate training opportunity for all americans who lose their job and expand rapid response team to help all town which have be really hurt when business close i hope you will support this

 also i ask your support for a dramatic increase in federal support for adult literacy to mount a national campaign aim at help the million and million of work people who still read at less than a fifth grade level we need to do this

 here be some good news in the past six year we have cut the welfare roll nearly in half you can all be proud of that two year ago from this podium i ask five company to lead a national effort to hire people off welfare tonight our welfare to work partnership include 10,000 company who have hire hundred of thousand of people and our balanced budget will help another 200,000 people move to the dignity and pride of work i hope you will support it

 we must do more to bring the spark of private enterprise to every corner of america to build a bridge from wall street to appalachia to the mississippi delta to our native american community with more support for community development bank for empowerment zone for 100,000 more voucher for affordable housing and i ask congress to support our bold new plan to help business raise up to $ 15 billion in private sector capital to bring job and opportunity to our inner city and rural area with tax credit loan guarantee include the new american private investment company model on the overseas private investment company

 for year and year and year we have have this opic this overseas private investment corporation because we know we have untapped market overseas but our great untapped market be not overseas they be right here at home and we should go after they

 we must work hard to help bring prosperity back to the family farm as this congress know very well drop price and the loss of foreign market have devastate too many family farm last year the congress provide substantial assistance to help stave off a disaster in american agriculture and i be ready to work with lawmaker of both party to create a farm safety net that will include crop insurance reform and farm income assistance i ask you to join with i and do this this should not be a political issue everyone know what an economic problem be go on out there in rural america today and we need an appropriate mean to address it

 since 1997 our initiative on race have seek to bridge the divide between and among our people in its report last fall the initiative 's advisory board find that americans really do want to bring our people together across racial line

 we know it be be a long journey for some it go back to before the beginning of our republic for other back since the civil war for other throughout the 20th century but for most of we alive today in a very real sense this journey begin 43 year ago when a woman name rosa parks sit down on a bus in alabama and would not get up she be sit down with the first lady tonight and she may get up or not as she choose we thank she applause thank you rosa

 my fellow americans this be our moment let we lift our eye as one nation and from the mountaintop of this american century look ahead to the next one ask god 's blessing on our endeavor and on our beloved country

 thank you and good evening

my fellow americans today our armed forces join our nato ally in airstrike against serbian force responsible for the brutality in kosovo we have act with resolve for several reason
 we act to protect thousand of innocent people in kosovo from a mount military offensive we act to prevent a wide war to diffuse a powder keg at the heart of europe that have explode twice before in this century with catastrophic result and we act to stand united with our ally for peace by act now we be uphold our value protect our interest and advance the cause of peace
 tonight i want to speak to you about the tragedy in kosovo and why it matter to america that we work with our ally to end it first let i explain what it be we be respond to kosovo be a province of serbia in the middle of southeastern europe about 160 mile east of italy that be less than the distance between washington and new york and only about 70 mile north of greece its people be mostly ethnic albanian and mostly muslim
 in 1989 serbia 's leader slobodan milosevic the same leader who start the war in bosnia and croatia and move against slovenia in the last decade strip kosovo of the constitutional autonomy its people enjoy thus deny they their right to speak their language run their school shape their daily life for year kosovars struggle peacefully to get their right back when president milosevic send his troop and police to crush they the struggle grow violent
 last fall our diplomacy back by the threat of force from our nato alliance stop the fighting for a while and rescue ten of thousand of people from freezing and starvation in the hill where they have flee to save their life and last month with our ally and russia we propose a peace agreement to end the fighting for good the kosovar leader sign that agreement last week even though it do not give they all they want even though their people be still be savage they see that a just peace be well than a long and unwinnable war
 the serbian leader on the other hand refuse even to discuss key element of the peace agreement as the kosovars be say yes to peace serbia station 40,000 troop in and around kosovo in preparation for a major offensive and in clear violation of the commitment they have make
 now they have start move from village to village shell civilian and torch their house we have see innocent people take from their home force to kneel in the dirt and spray with bullet kosovar man drag from their family father and son together line up and shoot in cold blood this be not war in the traditional sense it be an attack by tank and artillery on a largely defenseless people whose leader already have agree to peace
 end this tragedy be a moral imperative it be also important to america 's national interest take a look at this map kosovo be a small place but it sit on a major fault line between europe asia and the middle east at the meeting place of islam and both the western and orthodox branch of christianity to the south be our ally greece and turkey to the north our new democratic ally in central europe and all around kosovo there be other small country struggle with their own economic and political challenge country that could be overwhelm by a large new wave of refugee from kosovo all the ingredient for a major war be there ancient grievance struggle democracy and in the center of it all a dictator in serbia who have do nothing since the cold war end but start new war and pour gasoline on the flame of ethnic and religious division
 sarajevo the capital of neighboring bosnia be where world war i begin world war ii and the holocaust engulf this region in both war europe be slow to recognize the danger and the united states wait even long to enter the conflict just imagine if leader back then have act wisely and early enough how many life could have be save how many americans would not have have to die
 we learn some of the same lesson in bosnia just a few year ago the world do not act early enough to stop that war either and let us not forget what happen innocent people herd into concentration camp child gun down by sniper on their way to school soccer field and park turn into cemetery a quarter of a million people kill not because of anything they have do but because of who they be two million bosnians become refugee this be genocide in the heart of europe not in 1945 but in 1995 not in some grainy newsreel from our parent and grandparent time but in our own time test our humanity and our resolve
 at the time many people believe nothing could be do to end the bloodshed in bosnia they say well that be just the way those people in the balkans be but when we and our ally join with courageous bosnians to stand up to the aggressor we help to end the war we learn that in the balkans inaction in the face of brutality simply invite more brutality but firmness can stop army and save life we must apply that lesson in kosovo before what happen in bosnia happen there too
 over the last few month we have do everything we possibly could to solve this problem peacefully secretary albright have work tirelessly for a negotiate agreement mr. milosevic have refuse
 on sunday i send ambassador dick holbrooke to serbia to make clear to he again on behalf of the united states and our nato ally that he must honor his own commitment and stop his repression or face military action again he refuse
 today we and our 18 nato ally agree to do what we say we would do what we must do to restore the peace our mission be clear to demonstrate the seriousness of nato 's purpose so that the serbian leader understand the imperative of reverse course to deter an even bloody offensive against innocent civilian in kosovo and if necessary to seriously damage the serbian military 's capacity to harm the people of kosovo in short if president milosevic will not make peace we will limit his ability to make war
 now i want to be clear with you there be risk in this military action risk to our pilot and the people on the ground serbia 's air defense be strong it could decide to intensify its assault on kosovo or to seek to harm we or our ally elsewhere if it do we will deliver a forceful response
 hopefully mr. milosevic will realize his present course be self destructive and unsustainable if he decide to accept the peace agreement and demilitarize kosovo nato have agree to help to implement it with a peacekeeping force if nato be invite to do so our troop should take part in that mission to keep the peace but i do not intend to put our troop in kosovo to fight a war
 do our interest in kosovo justify the danger to our armed forces i have think long and hard about that question i be convinced that the danger of act be far outweigh by the danger of not act danger to defenseless people and to our national interest if we and our ally be to allow this war to continue with no response president milosevic would read our hesitation as a license to kill there would be many more massacre ten of thousand more refugee more victim cry out for revenge
 right now our firmness be the only hope the people of kosovo have to be able to live in their own country without have to fear for their own life remember we ask they to accept peace and they do we ask they to promise to lay down their arm and they agree we pledge that we the united states and the other 18 nation of nato would stick by they if they do the right thing we can not let they down now
 imagine what would happen if we and our ally instead decide just to look the other way as these people be massacre on nato 's doorstep that would discredit nato the cornerstone on which our security have rest for 50 year now
 we must also remember that this be a conflict with no natural national boundary let i ask you to look again at a map the red dot be town the serbs have attack the arrow show the movement of refugee north east and south already this movement be threaten the young democracy in macedonia which have its own albanian minority and a turkish minority already serbian force have make foray into albania from which kosovars have draw support albania have a greek minority let a fire burn here in this area and the flame will spread eventually key u.s. ally could be draw into a wide conflict a war we would be force to confront later only at far great risk and great cost
 i have a responsibility as president to deal with problem such as this before they do permanent harm to our national interest america have a responsibility to stand with our ally when they be try to save innocent life and preserve peace freedom and stability in europe that be what we be do in kosovo
 if we have learn anything from the century drawing to a close it be that if america be go to be prosperous and secure we need a europe that be prosperous secure undivided and free we need a europe that be come together not fall apart a europe that share our value and share the burden of leadership that be the foundation on which the security of our child will depend
 that be why i have support the political and economic unification of europe that be why we bring poland hungary and the czech republic into nato and redefine its mission and reach out to russia and ukraine for new partnership
 now what be the challenge to that vision of a peaceful secure united stable europe?—the challenge of strengthen a partnership with a democratic russia that despite our disagreement be a constructive partner in the work of build peace the challenge of resolve the tension between greece and turkey and building bridge with the islamic world and finally the challenge of end instability in the balkans so that these bitter ethnic problem in europe be resolve by the force of argument not the force of arm so that future generation of americans do not have to cross the atlantic to fight another terrible war
 it be this challenge that we and our ally be face in kosovo that be why we have act now because we care about save innocent life because we have an interest in avoid an even cruel and costly war and because our child need and deserve a peaceful stable free europe
 our thought and prayer tonight must be with the man and woman of our armed forces who be undertake this mission for the sake of our value and our child 's future
 may god bless they and may god bless america

my fellow americans tonight for the first time in 79 day the sky over yugoslavia be silent the serb army and police be withdraw from kosovo the one million man woman and child drive from their land be prepare to return home the demand of an outraged and united international community have be meet
  i can report to the american people that we have achieve a victory for a safe world for our democratic value and for a strong america our pilot have return to base the airstrike have be suspend aggression against an innocent people have be contain and be be turn back
  when i order our armed forces into combat we have three clear goal to enable the kosovar people the victim of some of the most vicious atrocity in europe since the second world war to return to their home with safety and self government to require serbian force responsible for those atrocity to leave kosovo and to deploy an international security force with nato at its core to protect all the people of that troubled land serbs and albanians alike those goal will be achieve a necessary conflict have be bring to a just and honorable conclusion
  the result will be security and dignity for the people of kosovo achieve by an alliance that stand together in purpose and resolve assist by the diplomatic effort of russia this victory bring a new hope that when a people be single out for destruction because of their heritage and religious faith and we can do something about it the world will not look the other way
  i want to express my profound gratitude to the man and woman of our armed forces and those of our allies day after day night after night they fly risk their life to attack their target and to avoid civilian casualty when they be fire upon from populated area i ask every american to join i in say to they thank you you have make we very proud
  i be also grateful to the american people for stand against the awful ethnic cleansing for send generous assistance to the refugee and for open your heart and your home to the innocent victim who come here
  i want to speak with you for a few moment tonight about why we fight what we achieve and what we have to do now to advance the peace and together with the people of the balkans forge a future of freedom progress and harmony
  we should remember that the violence we respond to in kosovo be the culmination of a 10 year campaign by slobodan milosevic the leader of serbia to exploit ethnic and religious difference in order to impose his will on the land of the former yugoslavia that be what he try to do in croatia and in bosnia and now in kosovo the world see the terrifying consequence 500 village burn man of all age separate from their love one to be shoot and bury in mass grave woman rape child make to watch their parent die a whole people force to abandon in hour communitie their family have spend generation build
  for these atrocity mr. milosevic and his top aide have be indict by the international war crimes tribunal for war crime and crime against humanity i will never forget the kosovar refugee i recently meet some of they could barely talk about what they have be through all they have leave be hope that the world would not turn its back
  when our diplomatic effort to avert this horror be rebuff and the violence mount we and our allies choose to act mr. milosevic continue to do terrible thing to the people of kosovo but we be determined to turn he back our firmness finally have bring an end to a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing and we act early enough to reverse it to enable the kosovars to go home
  when they do they will be safe they will be able to reopen their school speak their language practice their religion choose their leader and shape their destiny there will be no more day of forage for food in the cold of mountain and forest no more night of hiding in cellar wonder if the next day will bring death or deliverance they will know that mr. milosevic 's army and paramilitary force will be go his 10 year campaign of repression finish
  nato have achieve this success as a united alliance ably lead by secretary general solana and general clark nineteen democracy come together and stay together through the stiff military challenge in nato 's 50 year history
  we also preserve our critically important partnership with russia thank to president yeltsin who oppose our military effort but support diplomacy to end the conflict on term that meet our condition i be grateful to russian envoy chernomyrdin and finnish president ahtisaari for their work and to vice president gore for the key role he play in put their partnership together now i hope russian troop will join we in the force that will keep the peace in kosovo just as they have in bosnia
  finally we have avert the wide war this conflict might well have spark the country of southeastern europe back the nato campaign help the refugee and show the world there be more compassion than cruelty in this troubled region this victory make it all the more likely that they will choose a future of democracy fair treatment of minority and peace
  now we be enter a new phase build that peace and there be formidable challenge first we must be sure the serbian authority meet their commitment we be prepared to resume our military campaign should they fail to do so next we must get the kosovar refugee home safely mine field will have to be clear home destroy by serb force will have to be rebuild homeless people in need of food and medicine will have to get they the fate of the missing will have to be determine the kosovar liberation army will have to demilitarize as it have agree to do and we in the peacekeeping force will have to ensure that kosovo be a safe place to live for all its citizen ethnic serbs as well as ethnic albanians
  for these thing to happen security must be establish to that end some 50,000 troop from almost 30 country will deploy to kosovo our european allies will provide the vast majority of they america will contribute about 7,000 we be grateful that during nato 's air campaign we do not lose a single serviceman in combat but this next phase also will be dangerous bitter memory will still be fresh and there may well be casualty so we have make sure that the force go into kosovo will have nato command and control and rule of engagement set by nato it will have the mean and the mandate to protect itself while do its job
  in the meantime the united nations will organize a civilian administration while prepare the kosovars to govern and police themselves as local institution take hold nato will be able to turn over increase responsibility to they and draw down its force
  a third challenge will be to put in place a plan for last peace and stability in kosovo and through all the balkans for that to happen the european union and the united states must plan for tomorrow not just today we must help to give the democracy of southeastern europe a path to a prosperous share future a unify magnet more powerful than the pull of hatred and destruction that have threaten to tear they apart our european partner must provide most of the resource for this effort but it be in america 's interest to do our part as well a final challenge will be to encourage serbia to join its neighbor in this historic journey to a peaceful democratic united europe
  i want to say a few word to the serbian people tonight i know that you too have suffer in mr. milosevic 's war you should know that your leader could have keep kosovo as a part of your country without drive a single kosovar family from its home without kill a single adult or child without invite a single nato bomb to fall on your country you endure 79 day of bombing not to keep kosovo a province of serbia but simply because mr. milosevic be determined to eliminate kosovar albanians from kosovo dead or alive
  as long as he remain in power as long as your nation be rule by an indict war criminal we will provide no support for the reconstruction of serbia but we be ready to provide humanitarian aid now and to help to build a well future for serbia too when its government represent tolerance and freedom not repression and terror
  my fellow americans all these challenge be substantial but they be far preferable to the challenge of war and continued instability in europe we have send a message of determination and hope to all the world think of all the million of innocent people who die in this bloody century because democracy react too late to evil and aggression because of our resolve the 20th century be end not with helpless indignation but with a hopeful affirmation of human dignity and human right for the 21st century
  in a world too divide by fear among people of different racial ethnic and religious group we have give confidence to the friend of freedom and pause to those who would exploit human difference for inhuman purpose
  america still face great challenge in this world but we look forward to meet they so tonight i ask you to be proud of your country and very proud of the man and woman who serve it in uniform for in kosovo we do the right thing we do it the right way and we will finish the job
  good night and may god bless our wonderful united states of america
