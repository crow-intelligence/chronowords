restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection    without which liberty and even life itself be but dreary thing and let we    reflect that having banish from our land that religious intolerance under    which mankind so long bleed and suffer we have yet gain little if we countenance    a political intolerance as despotic as wicked and capable of as bitter and    bloody persecution during the throe and convulsion of the ancient world    during the agonizing spasm of infuriate man seek through blood and slaughter    his long lose liberty it be not wonderful that the

but every difference of opinion be not a difference of principle    we have call by different name brother of the same principle we be all    republicans we be all federalists if there be any among we who would wish    to dissolve this union or to change its republican form let they stand undisturbed    as monument of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerate where    reason be leave free to combat it i know indeed that some honest man fear    that a republican government can not be strong that this government be not    strong enough but would the honest patriot in the full tide of successful    experiment abandon a government which have so far keep we free and firm on the    theoretic and visionary fear that this government the world 's good hope may    by possibility want energy to preserve itself i trust not i believe this    on the contrary the strong government on earth i believe it the only one    where every man at the call of the law would fly to the standard of the law    and would meet invasion of the public order as his own personal concern sometimes    it be say that man can not be trust with the government of himself can he    then be trust with the government of other or have we find angel in the    form of king to govern he let history answer this question let we then with courage and confidence pursue our own federal and republican

degradation of the other possess    a choose country with room enough for our descendant to the thousandth and    thousandth generation entertain a due sense of our equal right to the use    of our

  gentleman   i have receive the remonstrance you be pleased to address to i on the    appointment of samuel bishop to the office of collector of new haven lately    vacate by the death of david austin the right of our fellow citizen to represent    to the public functionary their opinion on proceeding interesting to they    be unquestionably a constitutional right often useful sometimes necessary    and will always be respectfully acknolege by i   of the various executive duty no one excite more anxious concern than    that of place the interest of our fellow citizen in the hand of honest    man with understanding sufficient for their station no duty at the same    time be more difficult to fulfil the knolege of character possess by a    single individual be of necessity limit to seek out the good through the    whole union we must resort to other information which from the good of man    act disinterestedly and with the pure motive be sometimes incorrect    in the case of samuel bishop however the subject of your remonstrance time    be take information be seek amp such obtain as could leave no room    for doubt of his fitness from private source it be learn that his understanding    be sound his integrity pure his character unstaine and the office confide    to he within his own state be public evidence of the estimation in which    he be hold by the state in general and the city amp township particularly    in which he live he be say to be the town clerk a justice of the peace    mayor of the city of new haven an office hold at the will of the legislature    chief judge of the court of common plea for new haven county a court of high    criminal and civil jurisdiction wherein most cause be decide without the    right of appeal or review and sole judge of the court of probate wherein    he singly decide all question of will settlement of estate testate and    intestate appoint guardian settle their account and in fact have under    his jurisdiction and care all the property real and personal of person die    the two last    office in the annual gift of the legislature be give to he in may last    be it possible that the man to whom the legislature of connecticut have so recently    commit trust of such difficulty amp magnitude be ` unfit to be the collector    of the district of new haven tho acknolege in the same writing to have    obtain all this confidence ` by a long life of usefulness it be object    indeed in the remonstrance that he be 77 year of age but at a much more    advanced age our franklin be the ornament of human nature he may not be able    to perform in person all the detail of his office but if he give we the    benefit of his understanding his integrity his watchfulness and take care    that all the detail be well perform by himself or his necessary assistant    all public purpose will be answer the remonstrance indeed do not allege    that the office have be illy conduct but only apprehend that it will be    so should this happen in event be assure i will do in it what shall be just    and necessary for the public service in the meantime he should be try without    be prejudge   the removal as it be call of mr. goodrich form another subject of complaint    declaration by myself in favor of political tolerance exhortation to harmony    and affection in social intercourse and to respect for the equal right of    the minority have on certain occasion be quote amp misconstrue into    assurance that the tenure of office be to be undisturbed but could candor    apply such a construction it be not indeed in the remonstrance that we find    it but it lead to the explanation which that call for when it be consider    that during the late administration those who be not of a particular sect    of politic be exclude from all office when by a steady pursuit of this    measure nearly the whole office of the u s be monopolize by that sect    when the public sentiment at length declare itself and burst open the door    of honor and confidence to those whose opinion they more approve be it to    be imagine that this monopoly of office be still to be continue in the hand    of the minority do it violate their equal right to assert some right in    the majority also be it political intolerance to claim a proportionate share    in the direction of the public affair can they not harmonize in society unless    they have everything in their own hand if the will of the nation manifest by their various election call for an    administration of government accord with the opinion of those elect if    for the fulfilment of that will displacement be necessary with whom can    they so justly begin as with person appoint in the last moment of an administration    not for its own aid but to begin a career at the same time with their successor    by whom they have never be approve and who could scarcely expect from they    a cordial cooperation mr. goodrich be one of these be it proper for he    to place himself in office without know whether those whose agent he be    to be would have confidence in his agency can the preference of another as    the successor to mr. austin be candidly call a removal of mr. goodrich if    a due participation of office be a matter of right how be vacancy to be    obtain those by death be few by resignation none can any other mode than    that of removal be propose this be a painful office but it be make my duty    and i meet it as such i proceed in the operation with deliberation amp inquiry    that it may injure the good man least and effect the purpose of justice amp    public utility with the least private distress that it may be throw as much    as possible on delinquency on oppression on intolerance on incompetence    on ante revolutionary adherence to our enemy   the remonstrance lament quot;that a change in the administration must produce    a change in the subordinate officers;&quot in other word that it should be    deem necessary for all officer to think with their principal but on whom    do this imputation bear on those who have exclude from office every shade    of opinion which be not theirs or on those who have be so exclude lament    sincerely that unessential difference of political opinion should ever have    be deem sufficient to interdict half the society from the right and the    blessing of self government to proscribe they as character unworthy of every    trust it would have be to i a circumstance of great relief have i find    a moderate participation of office in the hand of the majority i would gladly    have leave to time and accident to raise they to their just share but their    total exclusion call for prompter corrective shall correct the procedure    but that do disdain to follow it    shall return with joy to that state of thing when the only question concern    a candidate shall be be he honest be he capable be he faithful to the constitution   i tender you the homage of my high respect
  fellow citizen of the senate and house of representatives                   it be a circumstance of sincere gratification to i that on meet the great    council of our nation i be able to announce to they on the ground of reasonable    certainty that the war and trouble which have for so many year afflict    our sister nation have at length come to an end and that the communication    of peace and commerce be once more opening among they while we devoutly return    thank to the beneficent being who have be pleased to breathe into they the    spirit of conciliation and forgiveness we be bind

with they would    not have be disturb but a cessation of the irregularity which have effect    the commerce of neutral nation and of the irritation and injury produce    by they can not but add to this confidence and strengthen at the same time    the hope that wrong commit on offend friend under a pressure of circumstance    will now be review with candor and will be consider as found just claim    of retribution for the past and new assurance for the future         among our indian neighbor also a spirit of peace and friendship generally    prevail and i be happy to inform you that the continue effort to introduce    among they the implement and the practice of husbandry and of the household    art have not be without success that they be become more and more sensible    of the superiority of this dependence for clothing and subsistence over the    precarious resource of hunting and fishing and already we be able to announce    that instead of that constant diminution of their number produce by their    war and their want some of they begin to experience an increase of population to this state of general peace with which we have be bless one only exception    exist tripoli the least considerable of the barbary states have come forward    with demand unfounded either in right or in compact and have permit itself    to denounce war on our failure to comply before a give day the style of the    demand admit but one answer i send a small squadron of frigate into the    mediterranean with assurance to that power of our sincere desire to remain    in peace but with order to protect our commerce against the threaten attack    the measure be seasonable and salutary the bey have already declare war in    form his cruiser be out two have arrive at gibraltar our commerce in the    mediterranean be blockade and that of the atlantic in peril the arrival    of our squadron dispel the danger one of the tripolitan cruiser having    fall in with and engage the small schooner enterprise command by lieutenant    sterret which have go as a tender to our large vessel be capture after    a heavy slaughter of her man without the loss of a single one on our part    the bravery exhibit by our citizen on that element will i trust be a testimony    to the world that it be not the want of that virtue which make we seek their    peace but a conscientious desire to direct the energy of our nation to the    multiplication of the human race and not to its destruction unauthorize by    the constitution without the sanction of congress to go out beyond the line    of defence the vessel be disabled from commit further hostility be    liberate with its crew the legislature will doubtless consider whether by    authorize measure of offence also they will place our force on an equal    footing with that of its adversary i communicate all material information    on this subject that in the exercise of the important function consider by    the constitution to the legislature exclusively their judgment may form itself    on a knowledge and consideration of every circumstance of weight i wish i could say that our situation with all the other barbary state be    entirely satisfactory discover that some delay have take place in the performance    of certain article stipulate by we i think it my duty by immediate measure    for fulfil they to vindicate to ourselves the right of consider the    effect of departure from stipulation on their side from the paper which will    be lay before you you will be enable to judge whether our treaty be regard    by they as fix at all the measure of their demand or as guard from the    exercise of force our vessel within their power and to consider how far it    will be safe and expedient to leave our affair with they in their present posture i lie before you the result of the census lately take of our inhabitant    to a conformity with which we be to reduce the ensue rate of representation    and taxation you will perceive that the increase of number during the last    ten year proceed in geometrical ratio promise a duplication in little    more than twenty two year we contemplate this rapid growth and the prospect    it hold up to we not with a view to the injury it may enable we to do to    other in some future day but to the settlement of the extensive country still    remain vacant within our limit to the multiplication of man susceptible    of happiness educate in the love of order habituate to self government    and value its blessing above all price other circumstance combine with the increase of number have produce an    augmentation of revenue arise from consumption in a ratio far beyond that    of population alone and though the change of foreign relation now take    place so desirably for the world may for a season affect this branch of revenue    yet weigh all probability of expense as well as of income there be reasonable    ground of confidence that we may now safely dispense with all the internal taxis    comprehend excise stamp auction license carriage and refined sugar    to which the postage on newspaper may be add to facilitate the progress    of information and that the remain source of revenue will be sufficient    to provide for the support of government to pay the interest on the public debt    and to discharge the principal in short period than the law or the general    expectation have contemplate war indeed and untoward event may change    this prospect of thing and call for expense which the impost could not meet    but sound principle will not justify our tax the industry of our fellow    citizen to accumulate treasure for war to happen we know not when and which    might not perhaps happen but from the temptation offer by that treasure these view however of reduce our burden be form on the expectation    that a sensible and at the same time a salutary reduction may take place in    our habitual expenditure for this purpose those of the civil government    the army and navy will need revisal when we consider that this government be charge with the external and mutual    relation only of these state that the state themselves have principal care    of our person our property and our reputation constitute the great field    of human concern we may well doubt whether our organization be not too complicated    too expensive whether office or officer have not be multiply unnecessarily    and sometimes injuriously to the service they be mean to promote i will    cause to be lay before you an essay toward a statement of those who under    public employment of various kind draw money from the treasury or from our    citizen time have not permit a perfect enumeration the ramification of    office be too multipled and remote to be completely trace in a first trial    among those who be dependent on executive discretion i have begin the reduction    of what be deem necessary the expense of diplomatic agency have be considerably    diminish the inspector of internal revenue who be find to obstruct the    accountability of the institution have be discontinue several agency    create by executive authority on salary fix by that also have be suppress    and should suggest the expediency of regulate that power by law so as to    subject its exercise to legislative inspection and sanction other reformation    of the same kind will be pursue with that caution which be requisite in remove    useless thing not to injure what be retain but the great mass of public    office be establish by law and therefore by law alone can be abolish    should the legislature think it expedient to pass this roll in review and try    all its part by the test of public utility they may be assure of every aid    and light which executive information can yield consider the general tendency    to multiply office and dependency and to increase expense to the ultimate    term of burden which the citizen can bear it behoove we to avail ourselves    of every occasion which present itself for take off the surcharge that it    may never be see here that after leave to labor the small portion of    its earning on which it can subsist government shall itself consume the residue    of what it be institute to guard in our care too of the public contribution intrust to our direction it    would be prudent to multiply barrier against their dissipation by appropriate    specific sum to every specific purpose susceptible of definition by disallow    application of money vary from the appropriation in object or transcend    it in amount by reduce the undefined field of contingency and thereby    circumscribe discretionary power over money and by bring back to a single    department all accountability for money where the examination may be prompt    efficacious and uniform an account of the receipt and expenditure of the last year as prepare by    the secretary of the treasury will as usual be lay before you the success    which have attend the late sale of the public land show that with attention    they may be make an important source of receipt among the payment those make    in discharge of the principal and interest of the national debt will show that    the public faith have be exactly maintain to these will be add an estimate    of appropriation necessary for the ensue year this last will of course be    effect by such modification of the system of expense as you shall think    proper to adopt a statement have be form by the secretary of war on mature consideration    of all the post and station where garrison will be expedient and of the    number of man requisite for each garrison the whole amount be considerably    short of the present military establishment for the surplus no particular use    can be point out for defence against invasion their number be as nothing    nor be it conceive needful or safe that a stand army should be keep up in    time of peace for that purpose uncertain as we must ever be of the particular    point in our circumference where an enemy may choose to invade we the only    force which can be ready at every point and competent to oppose they be the    body of neighboring citizen as form into a militia on these collect from    the part most convenient in number proportion to the invade foe it be    good to rely not only to meet the first attack but if it threaten to be permanent    to maintain the defence until regular may be engage to relieve they these    consideration render it important that we should at every session continue    to amend the defect which from time to time show themselves in the law for    regulate the militia until they be sufficiently perfect nor should we now    or at any time separate until we can say we have do everything for the militia    which we could do be an enemy at our door the provision of military store on hand will be lay before you that you    may judge of the addition still requisite with respect to the extent to which our naval preparation should be carry    some difference of opinion may be expect to appear but just attention to    the circumstance of every part of the

pleasing circumstance     which mark the goodness of that be from whose favor they flow and the large     measure of thankfulness we owe for his bounty another year have come around     and find we still bless with peace and friendship abroad law order and     religion at home good affection and harmony with our indian neighbor our     burthen lighten yet our income sufficient for the public want and the     produce of the year great beyond example these fellow citizen be the circumstance     under which we meet and we remark with special satisfaction those which under     the smile of providence result from the skill industry and order of our citizen     manage their own affair in their own way and for their own use unembarrasse     by too much regulation unoppresse by fiscal exaction on the restoration of peace in europe that portion of the general carry     trade which have fall to our share during the war be abridge by the return     competition of the belligerent power this be to be expect and be just     but in addition we find in some part of europe monopolize discrimination     which in the form of duty tend effectually to prohibit the carrying thither     our own produce in our own vessel from exist amity and a spirit of justice     it be hope that friendly discussion will produce a fair and adequate reciprocity     but should false calculation of interest defeat our hope it rest with the legislature to decide whether they will meet inequality abroad with countervail     inequality at home or provide for the evil in any other way it be with satisfaction i lie before you an act of the british parliament anticipate     this subject so far as to authorize a mutual abolition of the duty and countervail     duty permit under the treaty of 1794 it show on their part a spirit of     justice and friendly accommodation which it be our duty and our interest to     cultivate with all nation whether this would produce a due equality in the     navigation between the two country be a subject for your consideration another circumstance which claim attention as directly affect the very     source of our navigation in the defect or the evasion of the law provide for     the return of seaman and particularly of those belong to vessel sell abroad     number of they discharge in foreign port have danger into which their     distress might plunge they and save they to their country have find it necessary     in some case to return they at the public charge the cession of the spanish province of louisiana to france which take place     in the course of the late war will if carry into effect make a change in     the aspect of our foreign relation which will doubtless have just weight in     any deliberation of the legislature connect with that subject there be reason not long since to apprehend that the warfare in which we be     engage with tripoli might be take up by some other of the barbary powers     a reenforcement therefore be immediately order to the vessel already there     subsequent information however have remove these apprehension for the present     to secure our commerce in that sea with the small force competent we have     suppose it well to watch strictly the harbor of tripoli still however the     shallowness of their coast and the want of small vessel on our part have permit     some cruiser to escape unobserved and to one of these an american vessel unfortunately     fall a prey the captain one american seaman and two other of color remain     prisoner with they unless exchange under an agreement formerly make with the     bashaw to whom on the faith of that some of his captive subject have be     restore the convention with the state of georgia have be ratify by their legislature     and a

country to which their title have be extinguish     before the revolution be sufficient to receive a very respectful population     which congress will probably see the expediency of encourage so soon as the     limit shall be declare we be to view this position as an outpost of the     united states surround by strong neighbor and distant from its support     and how far that monopoly which prevent population should here be guard against     and actual habitation make a condition of the continuance of title will be for     your consideration a prompt settlement too of all exist right and claim     within this territory present itself as a preliminary operation in that part of the indian territory which include vicenne the line settle     with neighboring tribe fix the extinction of their title at a breadth of 24     league from east to west and about the same length parallel with and include     the wabash they have also cede a tract of four mile square include the salt     spring near the mouth of that river in the department of finance it be with pleasure i inform you that the receipt     of external duty for the last twelve month have exceed those of any former     year and that the ratio of increase have be also great than usual this     have enable we to answer all the regular exigency of government to pay from     the treasury within one year upward of $ 8,000,000 principal and interest of     the public debt exclusive of upward of one million pay by the sale of bank     stock and make in the whole a reduction of nearly five million and a half     of principal and to have now in the treasury $ 4,500,000 which be in a course     of application to the further discharge of debt and current demand experience     too so far authorize we to believe if no extraordinary event supervene     and the expense which will be actually incur shall not be great than be     contemplate by congress at their last session that we shall not be disappoint     in the expectation then form but nevertheless as the effect of peace on     the amount of duty be not yet fully ascertain it be the more necessary     to practice every useful economy and to incur no expense which may be avoid     without prejudice the collection of the internal taxis having be retard it will be some     time before the system be closed it be not yet be think necessary to employ     the agent authorize by an act of the last session for transact business     in europe relative to debt and loan nor have we use the power confide by     the same act of prolong the foreign debt by reloan and of redeem instead     thereof an equal sum of domestic debt should however the difficulty of     remittance on so large a scale render it necessary at any time the power shall     be execute and the money thus unemployed abroad shall in conformity with that     law be faithfully apply here in equivalent extinction of domestic debt when     effect do salutary result from the plan you have already sanction when     merely by avoid false object of expense we be able without a direct tax     without internal taxis and without borrow to make large and effectual payment     toward the discharge of public debt and the emancipation of our posterity from     that mortal canker it be an encouragement fellow citizen of the high     order to proceed as we have begin in substitute economy for taxation and     in pursue what be useful for a nation place as we be rather than what be     practice by other under different circumstance and whensoever we be destine     to meet event which shall call forth all the energy of our countryman we     have the firm reliance on those energy and the comfort of leave for call     like these the extraordinary resource of loan and internal taxis in the meantime     by payment of the principal of our debt we be liberate annually portion     of the external taxis and form from they a grow fund still far to     lessen the necessity of recur to extraordinary resource the usual account of receipt and expenditure for the last year with an estimate     of the expense of the ensue one will be lay before you by the secretary     of treasury no change be deem necessary in our military establishment an estimate     of its expense for the ensue year on its present footing as also sum to     be employ in fornication and other object within that department have be     prepare by the secretary of war and will make a part of the general estimate     which will be present you consider that our regular troop be employ for local purpose and that     the militia our general reliance for great and sudden emergency you will     doubtless think this institution worth of a review and give those improvement     of which you find susceptible estimate for the naval department prepare by the secretary of the navy     for another year will in like manner be communicate with general estimate     a small force in the mediterranean will still be necessary to restrain the tripoline     cruiser and the uncertain tenure of peace with some other of the barbary powers     may eventually require that force to be augment the necessity of procure     some small vessel for that service will raise the estimate but the difference     in their maintenance will soon make it a measure of economy presume it will be deem expedient to expend annually a convenient sum toward     provide the naval defense which our situation may require i can not but recommend     that the first appropriation for that purpose may go to the saving what we     already possess no care no attention can preserve vessel from rapid decay     which lie in water expose to the sun these decay require great and constant     repair and will consume if continue a great portion of the money destine     to naval purpose to avoid this waste of our resource it be propose to add     to our navy yard here a dock within which our present vessel may be lay up     dry and cover from the sun under these circumstance experience prove that     work of wood will remain scarcely at all affect by time the great abundance     of run water which this situation possess at height far above the level     of the tide if employ as be practice for lock navigation furnish the     mean for raise and lay up our vessel on a dry and sheltered bed and     should the measure be find useful here similar depository for lay up     as well as for build and repair vessel may hereafter be undertake at     other navy yard offer the same mean the plan and estimate of the work     prepare by a person of skill and experience will be present to you without     delay and from this it will be see that scarcely more than have be the cost     of one vessel be necessary to save the whole and that the annual sum to be     employ toward its completion may be adapt to the view of the legislature     as to naval expenditure to cultivate peace and maintain commerce and navigation in all their lawful     enterprise to foster our fishery as nursery of navigation and for the     nurture of man and protect the manufacture adapt to our circumstance     to preserve the faith of the

gentleman of the senate and of the house of representatives as the continuance of the act for establish trading house with the indian tribe will be under the consideration of the legislature at its present session i think it my duty to communicate the view which have guide i in the execution of that act in order that you may decide on the policy of continue it in the present or any other form or discontinue it altogether if that shall on the whole seem most for the public good the indian tribe reside within the limit of the united states have for a considerable time be grow more and more uneasy at the constant diminution of the territory they occupy although effect by their own voluntary sale and the policy have long be gain strength with they of refuse absolutely all further sale on any condition insomuch that at this time it hazard their friendship and excite dangerous jealousy and perturbation in their mind to make any overture for the purchase of the small portion of their land a very few tribe only be not yet obstinately in these disposition in order peaceably to counteract this policy of theirs and to provide an extension of territory which the rapid increase of our number will call for two measure be deem expedient first to encourage they to abandon hunting to apply to the raise stock to agriculture and domestic manufacture and thereby prove to themselves that less land and labor will maintain they in this well than in their former mode of living the extensive forest necessary in the hunting life will then become useless and they will see advantage in exchange they for the mean of improve their farm and of increase their domestic comfort secondly to multiply trading house among they and place within their reach those thing which will contribute more to their domestic comfort than the possession of extensive but uncultivated wild experience and reflection will develop to they the wisdom of exchange what they can spare and we want for what we can spare and they want in lead they thus to agriculture to facture and civilization in bring together their and our sentiment and in prepare they ultimately to participate in the benefit of our government i trust and believe we be act for their great good at these trading house we have pursue the principle of the act of congress which direct that the commerce shall be carry on liberally and require only that the capital stock shall not be diminish we consequently undersell private trader foreign and domestic drive they from the competition and thus with the good will of the indians rid ourselves of a description of man who be constantly endeavor to excite in the indian mind suspicion fear and irritation toward we a letter now inclose show the effect of our competition on the operation of the trader while the indians perceive the advantage of purchase from we be solicit generally our establishment of trading house among they in one quarter this be particularly interesting the legislature reflect on the late occurrence on the mississippi must be sensible how desirable it be to possess a respectable breadth of country on that river from our southern limit to the illinois at least so that we may present as firm a front on that as on our eastern border we possess what be below the yazoo and can probably acquire a certain breadth from the illinois and wabash to the ohio but between the ohio and yazoo the country all belong to the chickasaws the most friendly tribe within our limit but the most decide against the alienation of land the portion of their country most important for we be exactly that which they do not inhabit their settlement be not on the mississippi but in the interior country they have lately show a desire to become agricultural and this lead to the desire of buy implement and comfort in the strengthening and gratifying of these want i see the only prospect of plant on the mississippi itself the mean of its own safety duty have require i to submit these view to the judgment of the legislature but as their disclosure might embarrass and defeat their effect they be commit to the special confidence of the two house while the extension of the public commerce among the indian tribe may deprive of that source of profit such of our citizen as be engage in it it might be worthy the attention of congress in their care of individual as well as of the general interest to point in another direction the enterprise of these citizen as profitably for themselves and more usefully for the public the river missouri and the indians inhabit it be not as well know as be render desirable by their connection with the mississippi and consequently with we it be however understand that the country on that river be inhabit by numerous tribe who furnish great supply of fur and peltry to the trade of another nation carry on in a high latitude through an infinite number of portage and lake shut up by ice through a long season the commerce on that line could bear no competition with that of the missouri traverse a moderate climate offering accord to the good account a continue navigation from its source and possibly with a single portage from the western ocean and find to the atlantic a choice of channel through the illinois or wabash the lakes and hudson through the ohio and susquehanna or potomac or james river and through the tennessee and savannah river an intelligent officer with ten or twelve choose man fit for the enterprise and willing to undertake it take from our post where they may be spare without inconvenience might explore the whole line even to the western ocean have conference with the native on the subject of commercial intercourse get admission among they for our trader as other be admit agree on convenient deposit for an interchange of article and return with the information acquire in the course of two summer their arm and accouterment some instrument of observation and light and cheap present for the indians would be all the apparatus they could carry and with an expectation of a soldier 's portion of land on their return would constitute the whole expense their pay would be go on whether here or there while other civilized nation have encounter great expense to enlarge the boundary of knowledge by undertake voyage of discovery and for other literary purpose in various part and direction our nation seem to owe to the same object as well as to its own interest to explore this the only line of easy communication across the continent and so directly traverse our own part of it the interest of commerce place the principal object within the constitutional power and care of congress and that it should incidentally advance the geographical knowledge of our own continent can not but be an additional gratification the nation claim the territory regard this as a literary pursuit which it be in the habit of permit within its dominion would not be dispose to view it with jealousy even if the expire state of its interest there do not render it a matter of indifference the appropriation of $ 2 500 for the purpose of extend the external commerce of the united states while

from hastily enter into the sanguinary    contest and leave we only to look on and to pity its ravage these will be    heavy on those immediately engage yet the nation pursue peace will not    be exempt from all evil in the course of this conflict let it be our endeavor    as it be our interest and desire to cultivate the friendship of the belligerent    nation by every act of justice and of incessant kindness to receive their    armed vessel with hospitality from the distress of the sea but to administer    the mean of annoyance to none to establish in our harbor such a police as    may maintain law and order to restrain our citizen from embark individually    in a war in which their country take no part to punish severely those person    citizen or alien who shall usurp the cover of our flag for vessel not entitle    to it infect thereby with suspicion those of real americans and commit    we into controversy for the redress of wrong not our own to exact from every    nation the observance toward our vessel and citizen of those principle    and practice which all civilized people acknowledge to merit the character    of a just nation and maintain that of an independent one prefer every    consequence to insult and habitual wrong congress will consider whether the    exist law enable we efficaciously to maintain this course with our citizen    in all place and with other while within the limit of our jurisdiction    and will give they the new modification necessary for these object some contravention    of right have already take place both within our jurisdictional limit and    on the high sea the friendly disposition of the government from whose agent    they have proceed as well as their wisdom and regard for justice leave we    in reasonable expectation that they will be rectify and prevent in future    and that no act will be countenance by they which threaten to disturb our    friendly intercourse separate by a wide ocean from the nation of europe    and from the political interest which entangle they together with production    and want which render our commerce and friendship useful to they and theirs    to we it can not be the interest of any to assail we nor our to disturb they    we should be most unwise indeed be we to cast away the singular blessing    of the position in which nature have place we the opportunity she have endow    we with of pursue at a distance from foreign contention the path of industry    peace and happiness of cultivate general friendship and of bring collision    of interest to the umpirage of reason rather than of force how desirable then    must it be in a government like ours to see its citizen adopt individually    the view the interest and the conduct which their country should pursue    divest themselves of those passion and partiality which tend to lessen    useful friendship and to embarrass and embroil we in the calamitous scene    of europe confident fellow citizen that you will duly

conformably to these intention would be the execution of    the law that government have however think proper to suspend the ratification    of the convention of 1802 but the explanation which would reach they soon    after and still more the confirmation of they by the tenor of the instrument    establish the port and district may reasonably be expect to replace they    in the disposition and view of the whole subject which originally dictate    the convention i have the satisfaction to inform you that the objection which have be urge    by that government against the validity of our title to the country of louisana    have be withdraw its exact limit however remain still to be settle    between we and to this be to be add that having prepare and deliver the    stock create in execution

stipulation with the nation of europe in general our friendship and intercourse be undisturbed    and from the government of the belligerent power especially we continue to    receive those friendly manifestation which be justly due to an honest neutrality    and to such good office consistent with that as we have opportunity of render the activity and success of the small force employ in the mediterranean in    the early part of the present year the reenforcement send into that sea and    the energy of the officer have command in the several vessel will i trust    by the suffering of war

adjudication and from the impracticability of bring hither such as be not    seaworthy the bey of tunis having make requisition unauthorized by our treaty their    rejection have produce from he some expression of discontent but to those    who expect we to calculate whether a compliance with unjust demand will not    cost we less than a war we must leave as a question of calculation for they    also whether to retire from unjust demand will not cost they less than a war    we can do to each other very sensible injury by war but mutual advantage    of peace make that the good interest of both

maintenance and preservation from    decay when not in actual service and the competence of our finance to this    defensive provision without any new burthen be consideration which will have    due weight with congress in decide on the expediency of add to their number    from year to year as experience shall test their utility until all our important    harbor by these and auxiliary mean shall

proceeding fellow citizen to that qualification which the constitution    require before my entrance on the charge again confer upon i it be my    duty to express the deep sense i entertain of this new proof of confidence from    my fellow citizen at large and the zeal with which it inspire i so to conduct    myself as may well satisfy their just expectation on take this station on a former occasion i declare the principle on which    i believe it my duty to administer the affair of our commonwealth my conscience    tell i that i have on every occasion act up to that declaration accord    to its obvious import and to the understanding of every candid mind in the transaction of your foreign affair we have endeavor to cultivate    the friendship of all nation and especially of those with which we have the    most important relation we have do they justice on all occasion favor    where favor be lawful and cherish mutual interest and intercourse on fair    and equal term we be firmly convinced and we act on that conviction that    with nation as with individual our interest soundly calculate will ever    be find inseparable from our moral duty and history bear witness to the    fact that a just nation be take on its word when recourse be have to armament    and war to bridle other at home fellow citizen you well know whether we have do well or ill the    suppression of unnecessary office of useless establishment and expense    enable we to discontinue our internal taxis these cover our land with officer    and open our door to their intrusion have already begin that process of    domiciliary vexation which once enter be scarcely to be restrain from    reach successively every article of produce and property if among these    taxis some minor one fall which have not be inconvenient it be because their    amount would not have pay the officer who collect they and because if    they have any merit the state authority might adopt they instead of other    less approve the remain revenue on the consumption of foreign article be pay cheerfully    by those who can afford to add foreign luxury to domestic comfort be    collect on our seaboard and frontier only and incorporate with the transaction    of our mercantile citizen it may be the pleasure and pride of an american    to ask what farmer what mechanic what laborer ever see a tax gatherer of    the united states these contribution enable we to support the current expense    of the government to fulfil contract with foreign nation to extinguish the    native right of soil within our limit to extend those limit and to apply    such a surplus to our public debt as place at a short day their final redemption    and that redemption once effect the revenue thereby liberate may by a just    repartition among the state and a corresponding amendment of the constitution    be apply in time of peace to river canal road art manufacture    education and other great object within each state in time of war if injustice    by ourselves or other must sometimes produce war increase as the same revenue    will be increase by population and consumption and aid by other resource    reserve for that crisis it may meet within the year all the expense of the    year without encroach on the right of future generation by burden    they with the debt of the past war will then be but a suspension of useful    work and a return to a state of peace a return to the progress of improvement i have say fellow citizen that the income reserve have enable we to extend    our limit but that extension may possibly pay for itself before we be call    on and in the meantime may keep down the accruing interest in all event    it will repay the advance we have make i know that the acquisition of louisiana    have be disapprove by some from a candid apprehension that the enlargement    of our territory would endanger its union but who can limit the extent to which    the federative principle may operate effectively the large our association    the less will it be shake by local passion and in any view be it not well    that the opposite bank of the mississippi should be settle by our own brother    and child than by stranger of another family with which shall we be most    likely to live in harmony and friendly intercourse in matter of religion i have consider that its free exercise be place    by the constitution independent of the power of the general government i have    therefore undertake on no occasion to prescribe the religious exercise suit    to it but have leave they as the constitution find they under the direction    and discipline of state or church authority acknowledge by the several religious    society the aboriginal inhabitant of these country i have regard with the commiseration    their history inspire endow with the faculty and the right of man breathe    an ardent love of liberty and independence and occupy a country which leave    they no desire but to be undisturbed the stream of overflow population from    other region direct itself on these shore without power to divert or habit    to contend against they have be overwhelm by the current or drive before    it now reduce within limit too narrow for the hunter 's state humanity enjoin    we to teach they agriculture and the domestic art to encourage they to that    industry which alone can enable they to maintain their place in existence and    to prepare they in time for that state of society which to bodily comfort    add the improvement of the mind and moral we have therefore liberally furnish    they with the implement of husbandry and household use we have place among    they instructor in the art of first necessity and they be cover with the    aegis of the law against aggressor from among ourselves but the endeavor to enlighten they on the fate which await their present    course of life to induce they to exercise their reason follow its dictate    and change their pursuit with the change of circumstance have powerful obstacle    to encounter they be combat by the habit of their body prejudice of    their mind ignorance pride and the influence of interested and crafty individual    among they who feel themselves something in the present order of thing and    fear to become nothing in any other these person inculcate a sanctimonious    reverence for the custom of their ancestor that whatsoever they do must    be do through all time that reason be a false guide and to advance under    its counsel in their physical moral or political condition be perilous innovation    that their duty be to remain as their creator make they ignorance be safety    and knowledge full of danger in short my friend among they be see the action    and counteraction of good sense and bigotry they too have their anti philosopher    who find an interest in keep thing in their present state who dread reformation    and exert all their faculty to maintain the ascendency of habit over the duty    of improve our reason and obey its mandate in give these outline i do not mean fellow citizen to arrogate to myself    the merit of the measure that be due in the first place to the reflect    character of our citizen at large who by the weight of public opinion influence    and strengthen the public measure it be due to the sound discretion with which    they select from among themselves those to whom they confide the legislative    duty it be due to the zeal and wisdom of the character thus select who    lie the foundation of public happiness in wholesome law the execution of    which alone remain for other and it be due to the able and faithful auxiliary    whose patriotism have associate with i in the executive function during this course of administration and in order to disturb it the artillery    of the press have be level against we charge with whatsoever its licentiousness    could devise or dare these abuse of an institution so important to freedom    and science be deeply to be regret inasmuch as they tend to lessen its    usefulness and to sap its safety they might indeed have be correct by    the wholesome punishment reserve and provide by the law of the several states    against falsehood and defamation but public duty more urgent press on the    time of public servant and the offender have therefore be leave to find    their punishment in the public indignation nor be it unintereste to the world that an experiment should be fairly    and fully make whether freedom of discussion unaide by power be not sufficient    for the propagation and protection of truth whether a government conduct    itself in the true spirit of its constitution with zeal and purity and do    no act which it would be unwilling the whole world should witness can be write    down by falsehood and defamation the experiment have be try you have witness    the scene our fellow citizen have look on cool and collect they see    the latent source from which these outrage proceed they gather around    their public functionary and when the constitution call they to the decision    by suffrage they pronounce their verdict honorable to those who have serve    they and consolatory to the friend of man who believe he may be intrust    with his own affair no inference be here intend that the law provide by the state against    false and defamatory publication should not be enforce he who have time    render a service to public moral and public tranquillity in reform these    abuse by the salutary coercion of the law but the experiment be note to    prove that since truth and reason have maintain their ground against false    opinion in league with false fact the press confine to truth need no    other legal restraint the public judgment will correct false reasoning and    opinion on a full hearing of all party and no other definite line can be    draw between the inestimable liberty of the press and its demoralizing licentiousness    if there be still impropriety which this rule would not restrain its supplement    must be seek in the censorship of public opinion contemplate the union of sentiment now manifest so generally as augur    harmony and happiness to our future course i offer to our country sincere congratulation    with those too not yet rally to the same point the disposition to do so    be gain strength fact be pierce through the veil draw over they and    our doubt brother will at length see that the mass of their fellow citizen    with whom they can not yet resolve to act as to principle and measure think    as they think and desire what they desire that our wish as well as theirs    be that the public effort may be direct honestly to the public good that    peace be cultivate civil and religious liberty unassaile law and order preserve    equality of right maintain and that state of property equal or unequal    which result to every man from his own industry or that of his father when    satisfied of these view it be not in human nature that they should not approve    and support they in the meantime let we cherish they with patient affection    let we do they justice and more than justice in all competition of interest    and we need not doubt that truth reason and their own interest will at length    prevail will gather they into the fold of their country and will complete    their entire union of opinion which give to a nation the blessing of harmony    and the benefit of all its strength i shall now enter on the duty to which my fellow citizen have again call    i and shall proceed in the spirit of those principle which they have approve    i fear not that any motive of interest may lead i astray i be sensible of    no passion which could seduce i knowingly from the path of justice but the    weakness of human nature and the limit of my own understanding will produce    error of judgment sometimes injurious to your interest i shall need therefore    all the indulgence i have heretofore experience the want of it will certainly    not lessen with increase year i shall need too the favor of that be    in whose hand we be who lead our forefather as israel of old from their    native land and plant they in a country flow with all the necessary    and comfort of life who have cover our infancy with his providence and our    riper year with his wisdom and power and to whose goodness i ask you to join    with i in supplication that he will so enlighten the mind of your servant    guide their council and prosper their measure that whatsoever they do shall    result in your good and shall secure to you the peace friendship and approbation    of all nation
to the senate and house of representatives of the united states   at a moment when the nation of europe be in commotion and arm against each    other and when those with whom we have principle intercourse be engage in    the general contest and when the countenance of some of they toward our peaceable    country threaten that even that may not be affect by what be pass on the    general theater a meeting of the representative of the nation in both houses    of congress have become more than usually desirable come from every section    of our country they bring with they the sentiment and the information of the    whole and will be enable to give direction to the public affair which the    will and the wisdom of the whole will approve and support in take a view of the state of our country we in the first place notice the    late affliction of two of our city under the fatal fever which in latter time    have occasionally visit our shore providence in his goodness give it an early    termination on this occasion and lessen the number of victim which have usually    fall before it in the course of the several visitation by this disease it    have appear that it be strictly local incident to city and on the tide water    only incommunicable in the country either by person under the disease or by    good carry from diseased place that its access be with the autumn and it    disappear with the early frost these restriction within narrow limit of    time and space give security even to our maritime city three fourth of the    year and to the country always although from these fact it appear unnecessary    yet to satisfy the fear of foreign nation and caution on their part not to    be complain of in a danger whose limit be yet unknown to they i have strictly    enjoin on the officer at the head of custom to certify with exact truth    for every vessel sailing for a foreign port the state of health respect this    fever which prevail at the place from which she sail under every motive    from character and duty to certify the truth i have no doubt they have faithfully    execute this injunction much real injury have however be sustain from    a propensity to identify with this endemic and to call by the same name fever    of very different kind which have be place among those deem contagious    as we advance in our knowledge of this disease as fact develop the source    from which individual receive it the state authority charge with the care    of the public health and congress with that of the general commerce will become    able to regulate with effect their respective function in these department    the burthen of quarantine be feel at home as well as abroad their efficacy    merit examination although the health law of the states should be find to    need no present revisal by congress yet commerce claim that their attention    be ever awake to they since our last meeting the aspect of our foreign relation have considerably    change our coast have be infest and our harbor watch by private armed    vessel some of they without commission some with illegal commission other    with those legal form but commit piratical act beyond the authority of    their commission they have capture in the very entrance of our harbor    as well as on the high sea not only the vessel of our friend come to trade    with we but our own also they have carry they off under pretense of legal    adjudication but not dare to approach a court of justice they have plunder    and sink they by the way or in obscure place where no evidence could arise    against they maltreat the crew and abandon they in boat in the open    sea or on desert shore without food or covering these enormity appear    to be unreache by any control of their sovereign i find it necessary to    equip a force to cruise within our own sea to arrest all vessel of these    description find hover on our coast within the limit of the gulf stream    and to bring the offender in for trial as pirate the same system of hover on our coast and harbor under color of seek    enemy have be also carry on by public armed ship to the great annoyance    and oppression of our commerce new principle too have be interpolate    into the law of nation found neither in justice nor the usage or acknowledgment    of nation accord to these belligerent take to itself a commerce with its    own enemy which it deny to a neutral on the ground of its aid that enemy    in the war but reason revolt at such an inconsistency and the neutral have    equal right with the belligerent to decide the question the interest of our    constituent and the duty of maintain the authority of reason the only umpire    between just nation impose on we the obligation of provide an effectual    and determine opposition to a doctrine so injurious to the right of peaceable    nation indeed the confidence we ought to have in the justice of other still    countenance the hope that a sounder view of those right will of itself induce    from every belligerent a more correct observance of they with spain our negotiation for a settlement of difference have not have a    satisfactory issue spoliation during a former war for which she have formally    acknowledge herself responsible have be refuse to be compensate but on    condition affect other claim in no wise connect with they yet the same    practice be renew in the present war and be already of great amount on    the mobile our commerce pass through that river continue to be obstruct    by arbitrary duty and vexatious search proposition for adjust amicably    the boundary of louisana have not be accede to while however the right    be unsettled we have avoid change the state of thing by take new post    or strengthen ourselves in the dispute territory in the hope that the    other power would not by contrary conduct oblige we to meet their example and    endanger conflict of authority the issue of which may not be easily control    but in this hope we have now reason to lessen our confidence inroad have be    recently make into the territories of orleans and the mississippi our citizen    have be seize and their property plunder in the very part of the former    which have be actually deliver up by spain and this by the regular officer    and soldier of that government i have therefore find it necessary at length    to give order to our troop on that frontier to be in readiness to protect    our citizen and to repel by arm any similar aggression in future other    detail necessary for your full information of the state of thing between this    country and that shall be the subject of another communication in review these injury from some of the belligerent power the moderation    the firmness and the wisdom of the legislature will all be call into action    we ought still to hope that time and a more correct estimate of interest as    well as of character will produce the justice we be bind to expect but should    any nation deceive itself by false calculation and disappointment that expectation    we must join in unprofitable contest of try which party can do the other    the most harm some of these injury may perhaps admit a peaceable remedy    where that be competent it be always the most desirable but some of they be    of a nature to be meet by force only and all of they may lead to it i can not    therefore but recommend such preparation as circumstance call for the first    object be to place our seaport town out of danger of insult measure have be    already take for furnish they with heavy cannon for the service of such    land battery as may make apart of their defense against armed vessel approach    they in aid of these it be desirable we should have a competent number of gunboat    and the number to be competent must be considerable if immediately begin    they may be in readiness for service at the opening of the next season whether    it will be necessary to augment our land force will be decide buy occurrence    probably in the course of your session in the meantime you will consider whether    it would not be expedient for a state of peace as well as war so to organize    or class the militia as would enable we on any sudden emergency to call for    the service of the young portion unencumbered with the old and those have    family upward of 300,000 able bodied man between the age of 18 and 26 year    which the last census shews we may now count within our limit will furnish    a competent number for offense or defense in any point where they may be want    and will give time for raise regular force after the necessity of they shall    become certain and the reduce to the early period of life all its active    service can not but be desirable to our young citizen of the present as well    as future time inasmuch as it engage to they in more advanced age a quiet    and undisturbed repose in the bosom of their family i can not then but    earnestly recommend to your early consideration the expediency of so modify    our militia system as by a separation of the more active part from that which    be less so we may draw from it when necessary an efficient corps fit for real    and active service and to be call to it in regular rotation considerable provision have be make under former authority from congress    of material for the construction of ship of war of 74 gun these material    be on hand subject to the further will of the legislature turn from these unpleasant view of violence and wrong i congratulate you    on the liberation of our fellow citizen who be strand on the coast of tripoli    and make prisoner of war in a government bottom on the will of all the life    and liberty of every individual citizen become interesting to all in the treaty    therefore which have conclude our warefare with that state an article for the    ransom of our citizen have be agree to an operation by land by a small band    of our countryman and other engage for the occasion in conjunction with the    troop of the ex bashaw of that county gallantly conduct by our late consul    eaton and their successful enterprise on the city of derne contribute doubtless    to the impression which produce peace and the concluison of this prevent    opportunity of which the officer and man of our squadron destine for tripoli    would have avail themselves to emulate the act of valor exhibit by their    brother in the attack of last year reflect with high satisfaction on the    distinguished bravery displayed whenever occasion permit in the late mediterranean    service i think it would be an useful encouragement as well as a just reward    to make an opening for some present promotion by enlarge our peace establishment    of captain and lieutenant with tunis some misunderstanding have arisen not yet sufficiently explain    but friendly discussion with their ambassador recently arrive and a mutual    disposition to do whatever be just and reasonable can not fail of dissipate    these so that we may consider our peace on that coast generally to be on    as sound a footing as it have be at any precede time still it will not    be expedient to withdraw immediately the whole of our force from that sea the law provide for a naval peace establishment fix the number of frigate    which shall be keep in constant service in time of peace and prescribe that    they shall be man by not more than two third of their complement of seaman    and ordinary seaman whether a frigate may be trust to two third only of    her proper complement of man must depend on the nature of the service on which    she be order that may sometimes for her safety as well as to insure her    object require her full complement in advert to this subject congress    will perhaps consider whether the good limitation on the executive discretion    in this case would not be by the number of seaman which may be employ in the    whole service rather than by the number of the vessel occasion oftener arise    for the employment of small than of large vessel and it would lessen risk    as well as expense to be authorize to employ they of preference the limitation    suggest by the number of seaman would admit a selection of vessel well adapt    to the service our indian neighbor be advance many of they with spirit and other begin    to engage in the pursuit of agriculture and household manufacture they be    become sensible that the earth yield subsistence with less labor and more    certainty than the forest and find it their interest from time e to time to    dispose of part of their surplus and waste land for the mean of improve    those they occupy and of subsist their family while they be prepare    their farm since your last session the northern tribe have sell to we the    land between the connecticut reserve and the former indian boundary and those    on the ohio rom the same boundary to the rapid and for a considerable depth    inland the chickasaws and cherokees have sell we the country between and adjacent    to the two district of tennessee and the creeks the residue of their land    in the fork of ocmulgee up to the olcofauhatche the three former purchase    be important inasmuch as they consolidate disjoin part of our settle country    and render their intercourse secure and the second particularly so as with    the small point on the river which we expect be by this time cede by the piankeshaws    it complete our possession of the whole of both bank of the ohio from its    source to near its mouth and the navigation of that river be thereby render    forever safe to our citizen settle and settle on its extensive water the    purchase from the creeks too have be for some time particularly interesting    to the state of georgia the several treaty which have be mention will be submit to both house    of congress for the exercise of their respective function deputation now on their way to the seat of government from various nation    of indians inhabit the missouri and other part beyond the mississippi come    charge with assurance of their satisfaction with the new relation in which    they be place with we of their disposition to cultivate our peace and friendship    and their desire to enter into commercial intercourse with we a state of our    progress in explore the principle river of that country and of the information    respect they hitherto obtain will be communicate so soon as we shall    receive some further relation which we have reason shortly to expect the receipt at the treasury during the year end on the 30th day of september    last have exceed the sum 13,000,000 which with not quite five million    in the treasury at the beginning of the year have enable we after meet other    demand to pay nearly two million of the debt contract under the british    treaty and convention upward of four million of principle of the public debt    and four million of interest these payment with those which have be make    in three year and a half precede have extinguish of the fund debt nearly    eighteen million of principle congress by their act of november 10 1803    authorize we to borrow $ 1,750,000 toward meet the claim of our citizen    assume by the convention with france we have not however make use o this    authority because the sum of four million and a half which remain in the    treasury on the same 30th day of september last with receipt which we may    calculate on for the ensue year besides pay the annual sum of $ 8,000,000    appropriate to the funded debt and meet all the current demand which may    be expect will enable we to pay the whole sum of $ 3,750,000 assume by the    french convention and still leave we a surplus of nearly $ 1,000,000 at our free    disposal should you concur in the provision of arm and armed vessel recommend    by the circumstance of the time this surplus will furnish the mean of do    so on this first occasion of address congress since by the choice of my constituent    i have enter on a second term of administration i embrace the opportunity    to give this public assurance that i will exert my good endeavor to administer    faithfully the executive department and will zealously cooperate with you in    every measure which may tend to secure the liberty property and personal safety    of our fellow citizen and to consolidate the republican form and principle    of our government in the course of your session you shall receive all the aid which i can give    for the dispatch of public business and all the information necessary for your    deliberation of which the interest of our own country and the confidence    repose in we

madrid and the minister of that government for foreign affair by which it be agree that spoliation commit by spanish subject and carry into port of spain should be pay for by that nation and that those commit by french subject and carry into spanish port should remain for further discussion before this convention be return to spain with our ratification the transfer of louisiana by france to the united states take place an event as unexpected as disagreeable to spain from that moment she seem to change her conduct and disposition toward we it be first manifest by her protest against the right of france to alienate louisiana to we which however be soon retract and the right confirm then high offense be manifest at the act of congress establish a collection district on the mobile although by an authentic declaration immediately make it be expressly confine to our acknowledge limit and she now refuse to ratify the convention sign by her own minister under the eye of his sovereign unless we would consent to alteration of its term which would have affect our claim against she for the spoliation by french subject carry into spanish port to obtain justice as well as to restore friendship i think a special mission advisable and accordingly appoint james monroe minister extraordinary and plenipotentiary to repair to madrid and in conjunction with our minister resident there to endeavor to procure a ratification of the former convention and to come to an understanding with spain as to the boundary of louisiana it appear at once that her policy be to reserve herself for event and in the meantime to keep our difference in an undetermined state this will be evident from the paper now communicate to you after nearly five month of fruitless endeavor to bring they to some definite and satisfactory result our minister end the conference without having be able to obtain indemnity for spoliation of any description or any satisfaction as to the boundary of louisiana other than a declaration that we have no right eastward of the iberville and that our line to the west be one which would have leave we but a string of land on that bank of the river mississippi our injured citizen be thus leave without any prospect of retribution from the wrongdoer and as to boundary each party be to take its own course that which they have choose to pursue will appear from the document now communicate they authorize the inference that it be their intention to advance on our possession until they shall be repress by an oppose force consider that congress alone be constitutionally invest with the power of change our condition from peace to war i have think it my duty to await their authority for use force in any degree which could be avoid i have barely instruct the officer station in the neighborhood of the aggression to protect our citizen from violence to patrol within the border actually deliver to we and not to go out of they but when necessary to repel an inroad or to rescue a citizen or his property and the spanish officer remain at new orleans be require to depart without further delay it ought to be note here that since the late change in the state of affair in europe spain have order her cruiser and court to respect our treaty with she the conduct of france and the part she may take in the misunderstanding between the united states and spain be too important to be unconsidere she be prompt and decide in her declaration that our demand on spain for french spoliation carry into spanish port be include in the settlement between the united states and france she take at once the ground that she have acquire no right from spain and have mean to deliver we none eastward of the iberville her silence as to the western boundary leave we to infer her opinion might be against spain in that quarter whatever direction she might mean to give to these difference it do not appear that she have contemplate their proceeding to actual rupture or that at the date of our last advice from paris her government have any suspicion of the hostile attitude spain have take here on the contrary we have reason to believe that she be disposed to effect a settlement on a plan analogous to what our minister have propose and so comprehensive as to remove as far as possible the ground of future collision and controversy on the eastern as well as western side of the mississippi the present crisis in europe be favorable for press such a settlement and not a moment should be lose in avail ourselves of it should it pass unimproved our situation would become much more difficult formal war be not necessary it be not probable it will follow but the protection of our citizen the spirit and honor of our country require that force should be interpose to a certain degree it will probably contribute to advance the object of peace but the course to be pursue will require the command of mean which it belong to congress exclusively to yield or to deny to they i communicate every fact material for their information and the document necessary to enable they to judge for themselves to their wisdom then i look for the course i be to pursue and will pursue with sincere zeal that which they shall approve th jefferson

bring they    to such a termination by special mission charge with such power and instruction    as in the event of failure could leave no imputation on either our moderation    or forbearance the delay which have since take place in our negotiation    with the british government appear to have proceed from cause which do not    forbid the expectation that during the course of the session i may be enable    to lay before you their final issue what will be that of the negotiation for    settle our difference with spain nothing which have take place at the date    of the last despatch enable we to pronounce on the western side of the mississippi    she advance in considerable force and take post at the settlement of bayou    pierre on the red river this village be originally settle by france be    hold by she as long as she hold louisiana and be deliver to spain only as    a part of louisiana be small insulated and distant it be not observe    at the moment of redelivery to france and the united states that she continue    a guard of half a dozen man which have be station there a proposition however    having be lately make by our commander in chief to assume the sabine river    as a temporary line of separation between the troop of the two nation until    the issue of our negotiation shall be know this have be refer by the    spanish commandant to his superior and in the meantime he have withdraw his    force to the western side of the sabine river the correspondence on this subject    now communicate will exhibit more particularly the present state of thing    in that quarter         the nature of that country require indispensably that an unusual proportion    of the force employ there should be cavalry or mount infantry in order    therefore that the command officer might be enable to act with effect    i have authorize he to call on the governor of orleans and mississippi for    a corps of five hundred volunteer cavalry the temporary arrangement he have    propose may perhaps render this unnecessary but i inform you with great pleasure    of the promptitude with which the inhabitant of those territory have tender    their service in defence of their country it have do honor to themselves    entitle they to the confidence of their fellow citizen in every part of the    union and must strengthen the general determination to protect they efficaciously    under all circumstance which may occur having receive information that in another part of the united states a great    number of private individual be combine together arm and organize    themselves contrary to law to carry on military expedition against the territory    of spain i think it necessary by proclamation as well as by special order    to take measure for prevent and suppress this enterprise for seize    the vessel arm and other mean provide for it and for arrest and bring    to justice its author and abettor it be due to that good faith which ought    ever to be the rule of action in public as well as in private transaction    it be due to good order and regular government that while the public force    be act strictly on the defensive and merely to protect our citizen from    aggression the criminal attempt of private individual to decide for their    country the question of peace or war by commence active and unauthorized    hostility should be promptly and efficaciously suppress whether it will be necessary to enlarge our regular force will depend on the    result of our negotiation with spain but as it be uncertain when that result    will be know the provisional measure requisite for that and to meet any    pressure intervene in that quarter will be a subject for your early consideration the possession of both bank of the mississippi reduce to a single point    the defence of that river its water and the country adjacent it become    highly necessary to provide for that point a more adequate security some position    above its mouth command the passage of the river should be render sufficiently    strong to cover the armed vessel which may be station there for defence    and in conjunction with they to present an insuperable obstacle to any force    attempt to pass the approach to the city of new orleans from the eastern    quarter also will require to be examine and more effectually guard for    the internal support of the country the encouragement of a strong settlement    on the western side of the mississippi within reach of new orleans will be    worthy the consideration of the legislature the gun boat authorize by an act of the last session be so advanced that    they will be ready for service in the ensue spring circumstance permit    we to allow the time necessary for their more solid construction as a much    large number will still be want to place our seaport town and water in    that state of defence to which we be competent and they entitle a similar    appropriation for a further provision for they be recommend for the ensue    year a further appropriation will also be necessary for repair fortification    already establish and the erection of such work as may have real effect    in obstruct the approach of an enemy to our seaport town or their remain    before they in a country whose constitution be derive from the will of the people directly    express by their free suffrage where the principal executive functionary    and those of the legislature be renew by they at short period where under    the character of juror they exercise in person the great portion of the    judiciary power where the law be consequently so form and administer    as to bear with equal weight and favor on all restrain no man in the pursuit    of honest industry and secure to every one the property which that acquire    it would not be suppose that any safeguard could be need against insurrection    or enterprise on the public peace or authority the law however aware that    these should not be trust to moral restraint only have wisely provide punishment    for these crime when commit but would it not be salutary to give also the    mean of prevent their commission where an enterprise be meditate by private    individual against a foreign nation in amity with the united states power    of prevention to a certain extent be give by the law would they not be as    reasonable and useful be the enterprise prepare against the united states    while advert to this branch of the law it be proper to observe that in    enterprise meditate against foreign nation the ordinary process of bind    to the observance of the peace and good behavior could it be extend to act    to be do out of the jurisdiction of the united states would be effectual    in some case where the offender be able to keep out of sight every indication    of his purpose which could draw on he the exercise of the power now give    by law the state on the coast of barbary seem generally dispose at present to respect    our peace and friendship with tunis alone some uncertainty remain persuade    that it be our interest to maintain our peace with they on equal term or not    at all i propose to send in due time a reinforcement into the mediterranean    unless previous information shall show it to be unnecessary we continue to receive proof of the grow attachment of our indian neighbor    and of their disposition to place all their interest under the patronage of    the united states these disposition be inspire by their confidence in our    justice and in the sincere concern we feel for their welfare and as long as    we discharge these high and honorable function with the integrity and good    faith which alone can entitle we to their continuance we may expect to reap    the just reward in their peace and friendship the expedition of messrs. lewis and clarke for explore the river missouri    and the good communication from that to the pacific ocean have have all the success    which could have be expect they have trace the missouri nearly to its    source descend the columbia to the pacific ocean ascertain with accuracy    the geography of that interesting communication across our continent learn    the character of the country of its commerce and inhabitant and it be but    justice to say that messrs. lewis and clarke and their brave companion have    by this arduous service deserve well of their country the attempt to explore the red river under the direction of mr. freeman though    conduct with a zeal and prudence merit entire approbation have not be    equally successful after proceed up it about six hundred mile nearly as    far as the french settlement have extend while the country be in their possession    our geographer be oblige to return without complete their work very useful addition have also be make to our knowledge of the mississippi    by lieutenant pike who have ascend to its source and whose journal and map    give the detail of the journey will shortly be ready for communication to    both house of congress those of messrs. lewis and clarke and freeman will    require further time to be digest and prepare these important survey in    addition to those before possessed furnish material for commence an accurate    map of the mississippi and its western water some principal river however    remain still to be explore toward which the authorization of congress by    moderate appropriation will be requisite i congratulate you fellow citizen on the approach of the period at which    you may interpose your authority constitutionally to withdraw the citizen    of the united states from all further participation in those violation of human    right which have be so long continue on the unoffending inhabitant of africa    and which the morality the reputation and the good interest of our country    have long be eager to proscribe although no law you may pass can take prohibitory    effect till the first day of the year one thousand eight hundred and eight    yet the intervene period be not too long to prevent by timely notice expedition    which can not be complete before that day the receipt at the treasury during the year end on the 30th of september    last have amount to near fifteen million of dollar which have enable    we after meet the current demand to pay two million seven hundred thousand    dollar of the american claim in part of the price of louisiana to pay of    the funded debt upward of three million of principal and nearly four of interest    and in addition to reimburse in the course of the present month near two    million of five and a half per cent stock these payment and reimbursement    of the fund debt with those which have be make in the four year and a    half precede will at the close of the present year have extinguish upwards    of twenty three million of principal the duty compose the mediterranean fund will cease by law at the end of    the present season consider however that they be levy chiefly on luxury    and that we have an impost on salt a necessary of life the free use of which    other wise be so important i recommend to your consideration the suppression    of the duty on salt and the continuation of the mediterranean fund instead    thereof for a short time after which that also will become unnecessary for    any purpose now within contemplation when both of these branch of revenue shall in this way be relinquish there    will still ere long be an accumulation of money in the treasury beyond the    instalment of public debt which we be permit by contract to pay they can not    then without a modification assent to by the public creditor be apply    to the extinguishment of this debt and the complete liberation of our revenue    the most desirable of all object nor if our peace continue will they    be want for any other exist purpose the question therefore now come    forward to what other object shall these surplus be appropriate and    the whole surplus of impost after the entire discharge of the public debt    and during those interval when the purpose of war shall not call for they    shall we suppress the impost and give that advantage to foreign over domestic    manufacture on a few article of more general and necessary use the suppression    in due season will doubtless be right but the great mass of the article on    which impost be pay be foreign luxury purchase by those only who be rich    enough to afford themselves the use of they their patriotism would certainly    prefer its continuance and application to the great purpose of the public education    road river canal and such other object of public improvement as it may    be think proper to add to the constitutional enumeration of federal power    by these operation new channel of communication will be open between the    states the line of separation will disappear their interest will be identify    and their union cement by new and indissoluble tie education be here place    among the article of public care not that it would be propose to take its    ordinary branch out of the hand of private enterprise which manage so much    well all the concern to which it be equal but a public institution can alone    supply those science which though rarely call for be yet necessary to    complete the circle all the part of which contribute to the improvement of    the country and some of they to its preservation the subject be now propose    for the consideration of congress because if approve by the time the state    legislature shall have deliberate on this extension of the federal trust    and the law shall be pass and other arrangement make for their execution    the necessary fund will be on hand and without employment i suppose an amendment    to the constitution by consent of the states necessary because the object    now recommend be not among those enumerate in the constitution and to which    it permit the public money to be apply the present consideration of a national establishment for education particularly    be render proper by this circumstance also that if congress approve the    proposition shall yet think it more eligible to found it on a donation of land    they have it now in their power to endow it with those which will be among the    early to produce the necessary income this foundation would have the advantage    of be independent on war which may suspend other improvement by require    for its own purpose the resource destine for they this fellow citizen be the state of the public interest at the present moment    and accord to the information now possess but such be the situation of    the nation of europe and such too the predicament in which we stand with some    of they that we can not rely with certainty on the present aspect of our affair    that may change from moment to moment during the course of your session or    after you shall have separate our duty be therefore to act upon thing as    they be and to make a reasonable provision for whatever they may be be    army to be raise whenever a speck of war be visible in our horizon we never    should have be without they our resource would have be exhaust on danger    which have never happen instead of be reserve for what be really to take    place a steady perhaps a quickened pace in preparation for the defence of    our seaport town and water an early settlement of the most exposed and vulnerable    part of our country a militia so organize that its effective portion can    be call to any point in the union or volunteer instead of they to serve    a sufficient time be mean which may always be ready yet never prey on    our resource until actually call into use they will maintain the public    interest while a more permanent force shall be in course of preparation but    much will depend on the promptitude with which these mean can be bring into    activity if war be force upon we in spite of our long and vain appeal to    the justice of nation rapid and vigorous movement in its outset will go far    toward secure we in its course and issue and toward throw its burden    on those who render necessary the resort from reason to force the result of our negotiation or such incident in their course as may enable    we to infer their probable issue such further movement also on our western    frontier as may show whether war be to be press there while negotiation be    protract elsewhere shall be communicate to you from time to time as they    become known to i with whatever other information i possess or may receive    which may aid your deliberation on the great national interest commit to

except that of the     principal actor whose guilt be place beyond question some time in the latter part of september i receive intimation that design     be in agitation in the western country unlawful and unfriendly to the peace     of the union and that the prime mover in these be aaron burr heretofore distinguish     by the favor of his country the ground of these intimation be inconclusive     the object uncertain and the fidelity of that country know to be firm the     only measure take be to urge the informant to use their good endeavor to     get further insight into the design and proceeding of the suspect person     and to communicate they to i it be not until the latter part of october that the object of the conspiracy     begin to be perceive but still so blended and involve in mystery that nothing     distinct could be single out for pursuit in this state of uncertainty as to     the crime contemplate the act do and the legal course to be pursue i     think it well to send to the scene where these thing be principally in     transaction a person in whose integrity understanding and discretion entire     confidence could be repose with instruction to investigate the plot go     on to enter into conference for which he have sufficient credential with     the governor and all other officer civil and military and with their aid     to do on the spot whatever should be necessary to discover the design of the     conspirator arrest their mean bring their person to punishment and to     call out the force of the country to suppress any unlawful enterprise in which     it should be find they be engage by this time it be know that many boat     be under preparation store of provision collect and an unusual number     of suspicious character in motion on the ohio and its water besides despatch     the confidential agent to that quarter order be at the same time send to     the governor of the orleans and mississippi territory and to the commander     of the land and naval force there to be on their guard against surprise and     in constant readiness to resist any enterprise which might be attempt on the     vessel post or other object under their care and on the 8th of november     instruction be forward to general wilkinson to hasten an accommodation     with the spanish commander on the sabine and as soon as that be effect     to fall back with his principal force to the hither bank of the mississippi     for the defence of the intersecting point on that river by a letter receive     from that officer on the 25th of november but date october 21st we learn     that a confidential agent of aaron burr have be depute to he with communication     partly write in cipher and partly oral explain his design exaggerate     his resource and make such offer of emolument and command to engage he     and the army in his unlawful enterprise as he have flatter himself would be     successful the general with the honor of a soldier and fidelity of a good     citizen immediately despatch a trusty officer to i with information of what     have pass proceed to establish such an understanding with the spanish commandant     on the sabine as permit he to withdraw his force across the mississippi     and to enter on measure for oppose the project enterprise the general 's letter which come to hand on the 25th of november as have be     mention and some other information receive a few day early when bring     together develop burr 's general design different part of which only have     be reveal to different informant it appear that he contemplate two     distinct object which might be carry on either jointly or separately and     either the one or the other first as circumstance should direct one of these     be the severance of the union of these states by the alleghany mountain the     other an attack on mexico a third object be provide merely ostensible     to wit the settlement of a pretend purchase of a tract of country on the     washita claim by a baron bastrop this be to serve as the pretext for all     his preparation an allurement for such follower as really wish to acquire     settlement in that country and a cover under which to retreat in the event     of final discomfiture of both branch of his real design he find at once that the attachment of the western country to the present     union be not to be shake that its dissolution could not be effect with     the consent of its inhabitant and that his resource be inadequate as yet     to effect it by force he take his course then at once determined to seize     on new orleans plunder the bank there possess himself of the military and     naval store and proceed on his expedition to mexico and to this object all     his mean and preparation be now direct he collect from all the quarter     where himself or his agent possess influence all the ardent restless desperate     and disaffect person who be ready for any enterprise analogous to their     character he seduce good and well mean citizen some by assurance that     he possess the confidence of the government and be act under its secret     patronage a pretence which obtain some credit from the state of our difference     with spain and other by offer of land in bastrop 's claim on the washita this be the state of my information of his proceeding about the last of november     at which time therefore it be first possible to take specific measure to     meet they the proclamation of november 27 two day after the receipt of     general wilkinson 's information be now issue order be despatch to every     intersecting point on the ohio and mississippi from pittsburg to new orleans     for the employment of such force either of the regular or of the militia and     of such proceeding also of the civil authority as might enable they to seize     on all the boat and store provide for the enterprise to arrest the person     concern and to suppress effectually the further progress of the enterprise     a little before the receipt of these order in the state of ohio our confidential     agent who have be diligently employ in investigate the conspiracy have     acquire sufficient information to open himself to the governor of that state     and apply for the immediate exertion of the authority and power of the state     to crush the combination governor tiffin and the legislature with a promptitude     an energy and patriotic zeal which entitle they to a distinguished place in     the affection of their sister states effect the seizure of all the boat     provision and other preparation within their reach and thus give a first     blow materially disable the enterprise in its outset in kentucky a premature attempt to bring burr to justice without sufficient     evidence for his conviction have produce a popular impression in his favor     and a general disbelief of his guilt this give he an unfortunate opportunity     of hasten his equipment the arrival of the proclamation and order and     the application and information of our confidential agent at length awaken     the authority of that state to the truth and then produce the same promptitude     and energy of which the neighboring state have set the example under an act     of their legislature of december 23 militia be instantly order to different     important point and measure take for do whatever could yet be do some     boat account vary from five to double or treble that number and person     differently estimate from one to three hundred have in the meantime pass     the fall of the ohio to rendezvous at the mouth of the cumberland with other     expect down that river not apprize till very late that any boat be build on cumberland the     effect of the proclamation have be trust to for some time in the state of     tennessee but on the 19th of december similar communication and instruction     with those of the neighboring states be despatch by express to the governor     and a general officer of the western division of the state and on the 23rd of     december our confidential agent leave frankfort for nashville to put into activity     the mean of that state also but by information receive yesterday i learn     that on the 22rd of december mr. burr descend the cumberland with two boat     merely of accommodation carry with he from that state no quota toward his     unlawful enterprise whether after the arrival of the proclamation of the order     or of our agent any exertion which could be make by that state or the order     of the governor of kentucky for call out the militia at the mouth of cumberland     would be in time to arrest these boat and those from the fall of the ohio     be still doubtful on the whole the fugitive from ohio with their associate from cumberland     or any other place in that quarter can not threaten serious danger to the city     of new orleans by the same express of december nineteenth order be send to the governor     of new orleans and mississippi supplementary to those which have be give     on the 25th of november to hold the militia of their territory in     readiness to co operate for their defence with the regular troop and armed     vessel then under command of general wilkinson great alarm indeed be excite     at new orleans by the exaggerated account of mr. burr disseminate through     his emissary of the army and navy he be to assemble there general wilkinson     have arrive there himself on the 24th of november and have immediately put into     activity the resource of the place for the purpose of its defence and on the     tenth of december he be join by his troop from the sabine great zeal be     show by the inhabitant generally the merchant of the place readily agree     to the most laudable exertion and sacrifice for man the armed vessel     with their seaman and the other citizen manifest unequivocal fidelity to     the union and a spirit of determined resistance to their expect assailant surmise have be hazard that this enterprise be to receive aid from certain     foreign power but these surmise be without proof or probability the wisdom     of the measure sanction by congress at its last session have place we in     the path of peace and justice with the only power with whom we have any difference     and nothing have happen since which make it either their interest or our     to pursue another course no change of measure have take place on our part     none ought to take place at this time with the one friendly arrangement be     then propose and the law deem necessary on the failure of that be suspend     to give time for a fair trial of the issue with the same power negotiation     be still preferred and provisional measure only be necessary to meet the event     of rupture while therefore we do not deflect in the slight degree from     the course we then assume and be still pursue with mutual consent to     restore a good understanding we be not to impute to they practice as irreconcilable     to interest as to good faith and change necessarily the relation of peace     and justice between we to those of war these surmise be therefore to be     impute to the vaunting of the author of this enterprise to multiply his partisan     by magnify the belief of his prospect and support by letter from general wilkinson of the 14th and 18th of september which     come to hand two day after date of the resolution of the house of representatives     that be to say on the morning of the 18th instant i receive the important     affidavit a copy of which i now communicate with extract of so much of the     letter as come within the scope of the resolution by these it will be see     that of three of the principal emissary of mr. burr whom the general have     cause to be apprehend one have be liberate by habeas corpus and the     two other be those particularly employ in the endeavor to corrupt the     general and army of the united states have be embark by he for our port     in the atlantic states probably on the consideration that an impartial trial     could not be expect during the present agitation of new orleans and that     that city be not as yet a safe place of confinement as soon as these person     shall arrive they will be deliver to the custody of the law and leave to     such course of trial both as to place and process as its functionary may     direct the presence of the high judicial authority to be assemble at     this place within a few day the mean of pursue a sounder course of proceeding     here than elsewhere and the aid of the executive mean should the judge have     occasion to use they render it equally desirable for the criminal as for the     public that be already remove from the place where they be first apprehend     the first regular arrest should take place here and the course of proceeding     receive here its proper direction
to the senate and house of representative of the united states                   in compliance with the request of the house of representatives express in    their resolution of the 5th instant i proceed to give such information as be    possess of the effect of gun boat in the protection and defense of harbor    of the number think necessary and of the propose distribution of they among    the port and harbor of the united states          under the present circumstance and govern by the intention of the legislature    as manifest by their annual appropriation of money for the purpose of defence    it have be conclude to combine 1st land battery furnish with heavy    cannon and mortar and establish on all the point around the place favorable    for prevent vessel from lie before it 2d movable artillery which may    be carry as an occasion may require to point unprovide with fix battery    3d float battery and 4th gun boat which may oppose an enemy at its    entrance and co operate with the battery for his expulsion on this subject professional man be consult as far as we have opportunity    general wilkinson and the late general gates give their opinion in writing    in favor of the system as will be see by their letter now communicate the    high officer of the navy give the same opinion in separate conference    as their presence at the seat of government offer occasion of consult    they and no difference of judgment appear on the subject those of commodore    barron and captain tingey now here be recently furnish in writing and    transmit herewith to the legislature the efficacy of gun boat for the defence of harbor and of other smooth and    enclose water may be estimate in part from that of galley formerly much    use but less powerful more costly in their construction and maintenance    and require more man but the gun boat itself be believe to be in use with    every modern maritime nation for the purpose of defence in the mediterranean    on which be several small power whose system like ours be peace and defence    few harbor be without this article of protection our own experience there    of the effect of gun boat for harbor service be recent algiers be particularly    know to have owe to a great provision of these vessel the safety of its city    since the epoch of their construction before that it have be repeatedly insult    and injure the effect of gun boat at present in the neighborhood of gibraltar    be well know and how much they be use both in the attack and defence of    that place during a former war the extensive resort to they by the two great    naval power in the world on an enterprise of invasion not long since in prospect    show their confidence in their efficacy for the purpose for which they be    suit by the northern power of europe whose sea be particularly adapt    to they they be still more used the remarkable action between the russian    flotilla of gun boat and galley and a turkish fleet of ship of the line    and frigate in the liman sea 1788 will be readily recollect the latter    command by their most celebrated admiral be completely defeat and several    of their ship of the line destroy from the opinion give as to the number of gun boat necessary for some of    the principal seaport and from a view of all the town and port from orleans    to maine inclusive entitle to protection in proportion to their situation    and circumstance it be conclude that to give they a due measure of protection    in time of war about two hundred gun boat will be requisite accord to    first idea the following would be their general distribution liable to be    varied on more mature examination and as circumstance shall vary that be    to say to the mississippi and its neighboring water forty gun boat to savannah and charleston and the harbor on each side from st. mary 's to    currituck twenty five to the chesapeake and its water twenty to delaware bay and river fifteen to new york the sound and water as far as cape cod fifty to boston and the harbor north of cape cod fifty    the flotilla assign to these several station might each be under the care    of a particular commandant and the vessel compose they would in ordinary    be distribute among the harbor within the station in proportion to their importance of these boat a proper proportion would be of the large size such as those    heretofore build capable of navigate any sea and of reinforce occasionally    the strength of even the most distant port when menace with danger the residue    would be confine to their own or the neighboring harbor would be small    less furnish for accommodation and consequently less costly of the number    suppose necessary seventy three be build or build and the hundred and    twenty seven still to be provide would cost from five to six hundred thousand    dollar have regard to the convenience of the treasury as well as to the    resource of building it have be think that one half of these might be build    in the present year and the other half the next with the legislature however    it will rest to stop where we be or at any further point when they shall    be of opinion that the number provide shall be sufficient for the object at time when europe as well as the united states shall be at peace it would    not be propose that more than six or eight of these vessel should be keep    afloat when europe be in war treble that number might be necessary to be distribute    among those particular harbor which foreign vessel of war be in the habit    of frequent for the purpose of preserve order therein but they would be man in ordinary with only their complement for navigation    rely on the seaman and militia of the port if call into action on sudden    emergency it would be only when the united states should themselves be at war    that the whole number would be bring into actual service and would be ready    in the first moment of the war to co operate with other mean for cover    at once the line of our seaport at all time those unemployed would be withdraw    into place not expose to sudden enterprise haul up under shed from the    sun and weather and keep in preservation with little expense for repair or    maintenance it must be superfluous to observe that this specie of naval armament be propose    merely for defensive operation that it can have but little effect toward protect    our commerce in the open sea even on our coast and still less can it become    an excitement to engage in offensive maritime war toward which it would furnish    no mean
during the war which for some time have unhappily prevail among the power of europe the united states of america firm in their principle of peace have endeavor by justice by a regular discharge of all their national and social duty and by every friendly office their situation have admit to maintain with all the belligerent their accustomed relation of friendship hospitality and commercial intercourse take no part in the question which animate these power against each other nor permit themselves to entertain a wish but for the restoration of general peace they have observe with good faith the neutrality they assume and they believe that no instance of a departure from its duty can be justly impute to they by any nation a free use of their harbor and water the mean of refit and of refreshment of succor to their sick and suffering have at all time and on equal principle be extend to all and this too amidst a constant recurrence of act of insubordination to the law of violence to the person and of trespass on the property of our citizen commit by officer of one of the belligerent party receive among we in truth these abuse of the law of hospitality have with few exception become habitual to the commander of the british armed vessel hover on our coast and frequent our harbor they have be the subject of repeat representation to their government assurance have be give that proper order should restrain they within the limit of the right and of the respect due to a friendly nation but those order and assurance have be without effect no instance of punishment for past wrong have take place at length a deed transcend all we have hitherto see or suffer bring the public sensibility to a serious crisis and our forbearance to a necessary pause a frigate of the united states trust to a state of peace and leave her harbor on a distant service have be surprise and attack by a british vessel of superior force one of a squadron then lie in our water and cover the transaction and have be disable from service with the loss of a number of man kill and wound this enormity be not only without provocation or justifiable cause but be commit with the avow purpose of take by force from a ship of war of the united states a part of her crew and that no circumstance might be want to mark its character it have be previously ascertain that the seaman demand be native citizen of the united states having effect her purpose she return to anchor with her squadron within our jurisdiction hospitality under such circumstance cease to be a duty and a continuance of it with such uncontrolled abuse would tend only by multiply injury and irritation to bring on a rupture between the two nation this extreme resort be equally opposed to the interest of both as it be to assurance of the most friendly disposition on the part of the british government in the midst of which this outrage have be commit in this light the subject can not but present itself to that government and strengthen the motive to an honorable reparation of the wrong which have be do and to that effectual control of its naval commander which alone can justify the government of the united states in the exercise of those hospitality it be now constrain to discontinue in consideration of these circumstance and of the right of every nation to regulate its own police to provide for its peace and for the safety of its citizen and consequently to refuse the admission of armed vessel into its harbor or water either in such number or of such description as be inconsistent with these or with the maintenance of the authority of the law i have think proper in pursuance of the authority specially give by law to issue this my proclamation hereby require all armed vessel bear commission under the government of great britain now within the harbor or water of the united states immediately and without any delay to depart from the same and interdict the entrance of all the say harbor and water to the say armed vessel and to all other bear commission under the authority of the british government and if the say vessel or any of they shall fall to depart as aforesaid or if they or any

the prohibition contain in this proclamation either in repair any such vessel or in furnish she her officer or crew with supply of any kind or in any manner whatsoever or if any pilot shall assist in navigate any of the say armed vessel unless it be for the purpose of carry they in the first instance beyond the limit and jurisdiction of the united states or unless it be in the case of a vessel force by distress or charge with public dispatch as hereinafter provide for such person or person shall on conviction suffer all the pain and penalty by the law provide for such offense and i do hereby enjoin and require all person bear office civil or military within or under the authority of the united states and all other citizen or inhabitant thereof or be within the same with vigilance and promptitude to exert their respective authority and to be aid and assist to the carry this proclamation and every part thereof into full effect provide nevertheless that if any such vessel shall be force into the harbor or water of the united states by distress by the danger of the sea or by the pursuit of an enemy or shall enter they charge with dispatch or business from their government or

july a. d. 1807 and of the sovereignty and independence of the united states the thirty first th jefferson.by the president james madison secretary of state
   to the senate and house of representatives of the united states                   circumstance fellow citizen which seriously threaten the peace of our    country have make it a duty to convene you at an early period than usual    the love of peace so much cherish in the bosom of our citizen which have    so long guide the proceeding of their public council and induced forbearance    under so many wrong may not insure our continuance in the quiet pursuit of    industry the many injury and depredation commit on our commerce and navigation    upon the high sea for year past the successive innovation on those principle    of public law which have be establish by the reason and usage of nation    and peace and all the circumstance which induce the extraordinary mission    to london be already know to you the instruction give to our minister    be frame in the sincere spirit of amity and moderation they accordingly    proceed in conformity therewith to propose arrangement which might embrace    and settle all the point in difference between we to a mutual understanding    on our neutral and national right provide for a commercial intercourse on condition    of some equality after long and fruitless endeavor to effect the purpose    of their mission and to obtain arrangement within the limit of their instruction    they conclude to sign such as could be obtain and to send they for consideration    candidly declare to the other negotiation at the same time that they be    act against their instruction and that their government therefore could    not be pledge for ratification some of the article propose might have be    admit on a principle of compromise but other be too highly disadvantageous    and no sufficient provision be make against the principle source of the irritation    and collision which be constantly endanger the peace of the two nation    the question therefore whether a treaty should be accept in that form could    have admit but of one decision even have no declaration of the other party    impair our confidence in it still anxious not to close the door against friendly    adjustment new modification be frame and further concession authorize    than could before have be suppose necessary and our minister be instruct    to resume their negotiation on these ground on this new reference to amicable    discussion we be repose in confidence when on the 22d day of june last    by a formal order from british admiral the frigate cheapeake leave her port    for a distant service be attack by one of those vessel which have be lie    in our harbor under the indulgence of hospitality be disabled from proceeding    have several of her crew kill and four take away on this outrage no commentary    be necessary its character have be pronounce by the indignant voice of our    citizen with an emphasis and unanimity never exceed i immediately by proclamation    interdict our harbor and water to all british armed vessel forbid intercourse    with they and uncertain how far hostility be intend and the town of    norfolk indeed be threaten with immediate attack a sufficient force be    order for the protection of that place and such other preparation commence    and pursue as the prospect render proper an armed vessel of the united states    be dispatch with instruction to our minister at london to call on that    government for the satisfaction and security require by the outrage a very    short interval ought now to bring the answer which shall be communicate to    you as soon as receive then also or as soon after as the public interest    shall be find to admit the unratified treaty and proceeding relative to it    shall be make known to you         the aggression thus begin have be continue on the part of the british commander    by remain within our water in defiance of the authority of the country    by habitual violation of its jurisdiction and at length by put to death    one of the person whom they have forcibly take from on board the chesapeake    these aggravation necessarily lead to the policy either of never admit    an armed vessel into our harbor or of maintain in every harbor such an armed    force as may constrain obedience to the law and protect the life and property    of our citizen against their armed guest but the expense of such a standing    force and its inconsistence with our principle dispense with those courtesy    which would necessarily call for it and leave we equally free to exclude the    navy as we be the army of a foreign power from enter our limit to former violation of maritime right another be now add of very extensive    effect the government of that nation have issue an order interdict all trade    by neutral between port not in amity with they and be now at war with    nearly every nation on the atlantic and mediterranean sea our vessel be    require to sacrifice their cargo at the first port they touch or to return    home without the benefit of go to any other market under this new law of    the ocean our trade on the mediterranean have be sweep away by seizure and    condemnation and that in other sea be threaten with the same fate our difference with spain remain still unsettled no measure having be take    on her part since my last communication to congress to bring they to a close    but under a state of thing which may favor reconsideration they have be recently    press and an expectation be entertain that they may now soon be bring    to an issue of some sort with their subject on our border no new collision    have take place nor seem immediately to be apprehend to our former ground    of complaint have be add a very serious one as you will see by the decree    a copy of which be now communicate whether this decree which profess to    be conformable to that of the french government of november 21 1806 heretofore    communicate to congress will also be conform to that in its construction    and application in relation to the united states have not be ascertain at    the date of our last communication these however give reason to expect such    a conformity with the other nation of europe our harmony have ben uninterrupte and commerce    and friendly intercourse have be maintain on their usual footing our peace with the several state on the coast of barbary appear as firm as    at any former period and as likely to continue as that of any other nation among our indian neighbor in the northwestern quarter some fermentation be    observe soon after the late occurence threaten the continuance of our    peace message be say to be interchange and token to be pass which    usually denote a state of restlessness among they and the character of the    agitator point to the source of excitement measure be immediately take    for provide against that danger instruction be give to require explanation    and with assurance of our continued friendship to admonish the tribe to    remain quiet at home take no part in quarrel not belong o they as far    as we be yet inform the tribe in our vicinity who be most advanced in    the pursuit of industry be sincerely disposed to adhere to their friendship    with we and to their peace with all other while those more remote do not present    appearance sufficiently quiet to justify the intermission of military precaution    on our part the great tribe on our southwestern quarter much advanced beyond the other    in agriculture and household art appear tranquil and identify their view    with our in proportion to their advancement with the whole of these people    in every quarter i shall continue to inculcate peace and friendship with all    their neighbor and perseverance in those occupation and pursuit which will    well promote their own well being the appropriation of the last session for the defense of our seaport town    and harbor be make under expectation that a continuance of peace would permit    we to proceed in that work accord to our convenience it have be think    well to apply the sum then give toward the defense of new york charleston    and new orleans chiefly as most open and most likely first to need protection    and to leave place less immediately in danger to the provision of the present    session the gunboat too already provide have on a like principle be chiefly assign    to new york new orleans and the chesapeake whether our movable force on th    e water so material in aid of the defensive work on the land should be augment    in this or any other form be leave to the wisdom of the legislature for the    purpose of man these vessel in sudden attack on our harbor it be a matter    for consideration whether the seaman of the united states may not justly be    form into a special militia to be call on for tour of duty in defense    of the harbor where they shall happen to be the ordinary militia of the place    furnish that portion which may consist of landsman the moment our peace be threaten i deem it indispensable to secure a great    provision of those article of military store with which our magazine be    not sufficiently furnish to have await a previous and special sanction    by law would have lose occasion which might not be retrieve i do not hesitate    therefore to authorize engagement for such supplement to our exist stock    would render it adequate to the emergency threaten we and i trust that    the legislature feel the same anxiety for the safety of our country so    materially advanced by this precaution will approve when do what they would    have see so important to be do if then assemble expense also unprovide    for arise out of the necessity of call all our gunboat into actual service    for the defense of our harbor of all which account will be lay before you when a regular army be to be raise and to what extent must depend on the    information so shortly expect in the meantime i have call on the states    for quota of militia to be in readiness for present defense and have moreover    encourage the acceptance of volunteer and i be happy to inform you that these    have offer themselves with great

 before their explosion plot engender there i shall think it my duty to    lay before you the proceeding and the evidence publicly exhibit on the arraignment    of the principle offender before the circuit court of virginia you will be    enable to judge whether the defect be in the testimony in the law or in    the administration of the law and whenever it shall be find the legislation    alone can apply or originate the remedy the framer of our constitution certainly    suppose they have guard as well their government against destruction by treason    as their citizen against oppression under pretense of it and if these end    be not attain it be of importance to inquire by what mean more effectual    they may be secure the account of the receipt of revenue during the year end on the 30th    day of september last be not yet make up a correct statement will be hereafter    transmit from the treasury in the meantime it be ascertain that the receipt    have amount to near $ 16,000,000which with the five million and a half in    the treasury at the beginning of the year have enable we after meet the    current demand and interest incur to pay more than four million of the    principle of our fund debt these payment with those of the precede five    and a half year have extinguish of the fund debt $ 25,500,000 be the    whole which could be pay or purchase within the limit of the law and of our    contract and have leave we in the treasury $ 8,500,000 a portion of this sum    may be consider as a commencement of accumulation of the surplus of revenue    which after pay the installment of debt as they shall become payable will    remain without any specific object it may partly indeed be apply toward    complete the defense of the exposed point of our country on such a scale    as shall be adapt to our principle and circumstance this object be doubtless    among the first entitle to attention in such a state of our finance and it    be one which whether we have peace or war will provide security where it be    due whether what shall remain of this with the future surplus may be usefully    apply to purpose already authorize or more usefully to other require    new authority or how otherwise they shall be dispose of be question call    for the notice of congress unless indeed they shall be supercede by a change    in our public relation now await the determination of other whatever be    that determination it be a great consolation that it will become know at a    moment when the supreme council of the nation be assemble at its post and    ready to give the aid of its wisdom and authority to whatever course the good    of our country shall then call we to pursue matter of minor importance will be the subject of future communication    and nothing shall be want on my part which may give information or dispatch    to the proceeding of the legislature in the excercise of their high duty    and at a moment so interesting to the public welfare
   to the senate and house of representative of the united states                   it would have be a source fellow citizen of much gratification if our    last communication from europe have enable i to inform you that the belligerent    nation whose disregard of neutral right have be so destructive to our commerce    have become awakened to the duty and true policy of revoke their unrighteous    edict that no mean might be omit to produce this salutary effect i lose    no time in avail myself of the act authorize a suspension in whole or    in part of the several embargo law our minister at london and paris be    instruct to explain to the respective government there our disposition to    exercise the authority in such manner as would withdraw the pretext on which    the aggression be originally found and open a way for a renewal of that    commercial intercourse which it be allege on all side have be reluctantly    obstruct as each of those government have pledge its readiness to concur    in renounce a measure which reach its adversary through the incontestable    right of neutral only and as the measure have be assume by each as a retaliation    for an asserted acquiescence in the aggression of the other it be reasonably    expect that the occasion would have be seize by both for evince the sincerity    of their profession and for restore to the commerce of the united states    its legitimate freedom the instruction to our minister with respect to the    different belligerent be necessarily modify with reference to their different    circumstance and to the condition annex by law to the executive power of    suspension require a degree of security to our commerce which would not result    from a repeal of the decree of france instead of a pledge therefore of a    suspension of the embargo as to she in case of such a repeal it be presume    that a sufficient inducement might be find in other consideration and particularly    in the change produce by a compliance with our just demand by one belligerent    and a refusal by the other in the relation between the other and the united    states to great britain whose power on the ocean be so ascendant it be deem    not inconsistent with that condition to state explicitly that on her rescind    her order in relation to the united states their trade would be open with    she and remain shut to her enemy in case of his failure to rescind his decree    also from france no answer have be receive nor any indication that the requisite    change in her decree be contemplate the favorable reception of the proposition    to great britain be the less to be doubt as her order of council have not    only be refer for their vindication to an acquiescence on the part of the    united states no long to be pretend but as the arrangement propose while    it resist the illegal decree of france involve moreover substantially    the precise advantage professedly aim at by the british order the arrangement    have nevertheless be reject         this candid and liberal experiment having thus fail and no other event having    occur on which a suspension of the embargo by the executive be authorize    it necessarily remain in the extent originally give to it we have the satisfaction    however to reflect that in return for the privation by the measure and which    our fellow citizen in general have bear with patriotism it have have the important    effect of save our mariner and our vast mercantile property as well as    of afford time for prosecute the defensive and provisional measure call    for by the occasion it have demonstrate to foreign nation the moderation and    firmness which govern our council and to our citizen the necessity of unite    in support of the law and the right of their country and have thus long frustrate    those usurpation and spoliation which if resist involve war if submit    to sacrifice a vital principle of our national independence under a continuance of the belligerent measure which in defiance of law    which consecrate the right of neutral overspread the ocean with danger it    will rest with the wisdom of congress to decide on the course well adapt to    such a state of thing and bring with they as they do from every part    of the union the sentiment of our constituent my confidence be strengthen    that in form this decision they will with an unerring regard to the essential    right and interest of the nation weigh and compare the painful alternative    out of which a choice be to be make nor should i do justice to the virtue    which on other occasion have mark the character of our fellow citizen if    i do not cherish an equal confidence that the alternative choose whatever    it may be will be maintain with all the fortitude and patriotism which the    crisis ought to inspire the document contain the correspondence on the subject of the foreign    edict against our commerce with the instruction give to our minister at    london and paris be now lay before you the communication make to congress at their last session explain the posture    in which the close of the discussion relate to the attack by a british ship    of war on the frigate chesapeake leave a subject on which the nation have manifest    so honorable a sensibility every view of what have pass authorize a belief    that immediate step would be take by the british government for redress    a wrong which the more it be investigate appear the more clearly to require    what have not be provide for in the special mission it be find that no step    have be take for the purpose on the contrary it will be see in the document    lay before you that the inadmissible preliminary which obstruct the adjustment    be still adhere to and moreover that it be now bring into connection with    the distinct and irrelative case of the order in council the instruction    which have be give to our minister at london with a view to facilitate if    necessary the reparation claim by the united states be include in the    document communicate our relation with the other power of europe have undergo no material change    since your last session the important negotiation with spain which have be    alternately suspend and resume necessarily experience a pause under the    extraordinary and interesting crisis which distinguish her internal situation with the barbary power we continue in harmony with the exception of an unjustifiable    proceeding of the dey of algiers toward our consul to that regency its character    and circumstance be now lay before you and will enable you to decide how    far it may either now or hereafter call for any measure not within the limit    of the executive authority with our indian neighbor the public peace have be steadily maintain some    instance of individual wrong have as at other time take place but in nowise    implicate the will of the nation beyond the mississippi the

strength daily be extend    from the nearer to the more remote and will amply requite we for the justice    and friendship practise towards they husbandry and household manufacture be    advance among they more rapidly with the southern than the northern tribe    from circumstance of soil and climate and one of the two great division of    the cherokee nation have now under consideration to solicit the citizenship    of the united states and to be identify with we in law and government in    such progressive manner as we shall think well in consequence of the appropriation of the last session of congress for the    security of our seaport town and harbor such work of defence have be erect    as seem to be call for by the situation of the several place their relative    importance and the scale of expense indicate by the amount of the appropriation    these work will chiefly be finish in the course of the present season except    at new york and new orleans where most be to be do and although a great    proportion of the last appropriation have be expend on the former place    yet some further view will be submit by congress for render its security    entirely adequate against naval enterprise a view of what have be do at    the several place and of what be propose to be do shall be communicate    as soon as the several report be receive of the gun boat authorize by the act of december last it have be think    necessary to build only one hundred and three in the present year these with    those before possess be sufficient for the harbor and water expose and    the residue will require little time for their construction when it be deem    necessary under the act of the last session for raise an additional military force    so many officer be immediately appoint as be necessary for carry on    the business of recruiting and in proportion as it advance other have be    add we have reason to believe their success have be satisfactory although    such return have not yet be receive as enable i to present to you a statement    of the number engage i have not think it necessary in the course of the last season to call for    any general detachment of militia or volunteer under the law pass for that    purpose for the ensue season however they will require to be in readiness    should their service be want some small and special detachment have be    necessary to maintain the law of embargo on that portion of our northern frontier    which offer peculiar facility for evasion but these be replace as soon    as it could be do by body of new recruit by the aid of these and of the    armed vessel call into actual service in other quarter the spirit of disobedience    and abuse which manifest itself early and with sensible effect while we be    unprepared to meet it have be considerably repress consider the extraordinary character of the time in which we live our    attention should unremittingly be fix on the safety of our country for a    people who be free and who mean to remain so a well organize and armed militia    be their good security it be therefore incumbent on we at every meeting    to revise the condition of the militia and to ask ourselves if it be prepare    to repel a powerful enemy at every point of our territory expose to invasion    some of the states have pay a laudable attention to this object but every    degree of neglect be to be find among other congress alone have power to    produce a uniform state of preparation in this great organ of defence the interest    which they so deeply feel in their own and their country 's security will present    this as among the most important object of their deliberation under the act of march 11th and april 23d respect arm the difficulty    of procure they from abroad during the present situation and disposition    of europe induce we to direct our whole effort to the mean of internal supply    the public factory have therefore be enlarge additional machinery    erect and in proportion as artificer can be find or form their effect    already more than double may be increase so as to keep pace with the yearly    increase of the militia the annual sum appropriate by the latter act have    be direct to the encouragement of private factory of arm and contract    have be enter into with individual undertaker to nearly the amount of the    first year 's appropriation the suspension of our foreign commerce produce by the injustice of the belligerent    power and the consequent loss and sacrifice of our citizen be subject    of just concern the situation into which we have thus be force have impel    we to apply a portion of our industry and capital to internal manufacture and    improvement the extent of this conversion be daily increase and little    doubt remain that the establishment form and form will under the auspex    of cheap material and subsistence the freedom of labor from taxation with    we and of protect duty and prohibition become permanent the commerce    with the indians too within our own boundary be likely to receive abundant    aliment from the same internal source and will secure to they peace and the    progress of civilization undisturbe by practice hostile to both the account of the receipt and expenditure during the year end on the    30th day of september last be not yet make up a correct statement will    hereafter be transmit from the treasury in the meantime it be ascertain    that the receipt have amount to near eighteen million of dollar which    with the eight million and a half in the treasury at the beginning of the year    have enable we after meet the current demand and interest incur to    pay two million three hundred thousand dollar of the principal of our fund    debt and leave we in the treasury on that day near fourteen million of dollar    of these five million three hundred and fifty thousand dollar will be necessary    to pay what will be due on the first day of january next which will complete    the reimbursement of the eight per cent stock these payment with those make    in the six year and a half precede will have extinguish thirty three million    five hundred and eighty thousand dollar of the principal of the fund debt    be the whole which could be pay or purchase within the limit of the law    and our contract and the amount of principal thus discharged will have liberate    the revenue from about two million of dollar of interest and add that sum    annually to the disposable surplus the probable accumulation of the surplus    of revenue beyond what can be apply to the payment of the public debt whenever    the freedom and safety of our commerce shall be restore merit the consideration    of congress shall it lie unproductive in the public vault shall the revenue    be reduce or shall it rather be appropriate to the improvement of road    canal river education and other great foundation of prosperity and union    under the power which congress may already possess or such amendment of the    constitution as may be approve by the states while uncertain of the course    of thing the time may be advantageously employ in obtain the power necessary    for a system of improvement should that be think well avail myself of this the last occasion which will occur of address the    two house of the legislature at their meeting i can not omit the expression    of my sincere gratitude for the repeat proof of confidence manifest to    i by themselves and their predecessor since my call to the administration    and the many indulgence experience at their hand the same grateful acknowledgment    be due to my fellow citizen generally whose support have be my great encouragement    under all embarrassment in the transaction of their business i can not have    escape error it be incident to our imperfect nature but i may say with truth    my error have be of the understanding not of intention and that the advancement    of their right and interest have be the constant motive for every measure    on these consideration i solicit their indulgence look forward with anxiety    to their future destiny i trust that in their steady character unshaken    by difficulty in their love of liberty obedience to law and support of    the public authority i see a sure guaranty of the permanence of our republic    and retire from the charge of their affair i carry with i the consolation    of a firm persuasion that heaven have in store for our beloved country long age    to come of prosperity and happiness
unwilling to depart from example of the most revere authority i avail myself of the occasion now present to express the profound impression make on i by the call of my country to the station to the duty of which i be about to pledge myself by the most solemn of sanction so distinguish a mark of confidence proceed from the deliberate and tranquil suffrage of a free and virtuous nation would under any circumstance have command my gratitude and devotion as well as fill i with an awful sense of the trust to be assume under the various circumstance which give peculiar solemnity to the exist period i feel that both the honor and the responsibility allot to i be inexpressibly enhance

 the present situation of the world be indeed without a parallel and that of our own country full of difficulty the pressure of these too be the more severely feel because they have fall upon we at a moment when the national prosperity be at a height not before attain the contrast result from the change have be render the more striking under the benign influence of our republican institution and the maintenance of peace with all nation whilst so many of they be engage in bloody and wasteful war the fruit of a just policy be enjoy in an unrivaled growth of our faculty and resource proof of this be see in the improvement of agriculture in the successful enterprise of commerce in the progress of manufacturer and useful art in the increase of the public revenue and the use make of it in reduce the public debt and in the valuable work and establishment everywhere multiply over the face of our land

 it be a precious reflection that the transition from this prosperous condition of our country to the scene which have for some time be distress we be not chargeable on any unwarrantable view nor as i trust on any involuntary error in the public council indulge no passion which trespass on the right or the repose of other nation it have be the true glory of the united states to cultivate peace by observe justice and to entitle themselves to the respect of the nation at war by fulfil their neutral obligation with the most scrupulous impartiality if there be candor in the world the truth of these assertion will not be question posterity at least will do justice to they

 this unexceptionable course could not avail against the injustice and violence of the belligerent power in their rage against each other or impel by more direct motive principle of retaliation have be introduce equally contrary to universal reason and acknowledge law how long their arbitrary edict will be continue in spite of the demonstration that not even a pretext for they have be give by the united states and of the fair and liberal attempt to induce a revocation of they can not be anticipate assure myself that under every vicissitude the determine spirit and united council of the nation will be safeguard to its honor and its essential interest i repair to the post assign i with no other discouragement than what spring from my own inadequacy to its high duty if i do not sink under the weight of this deep conviction it be because i find some support in a consciousness of the purpose and a confidence in the principle which i bring with i into this arduous service

 to cherish peace and friendly intercourse with all nation have correspondent disposition to maintain sincere neutrality toward belligerent nation to prefer in all case amicable discussion and reasonable accommodation of difference to a decision of they by an appeal to arm to exclude foreign intrigue and foreign partiality so degrade to all country and so baneful to free one to foster a spirit of independence too just to invade the right of other too proud to surrender our own too liberal to indulge unworthy prejudice ourselves and too elevated not to look down upon they in other to hold the union of the states as the basis of their peace and happiness to support the constitution which be the cement of the union as well in its limitation as in its authority to respect the right and authority reserve to the states and to the people as equally incorporate with and essential to the success of the general system to avoid the slight interference with the right of conscience or the function of religion so wisely exempt from civil jurisdiction to preserve in their full energy the other salutary provision in behalf of private and personal right and of the freedom of the press to observe economy in public expenditure to liberate the public resource by an honorable discharge of the public debt to keep within the requisite limit a stand military force always remember that an armed and train militia be the firm bulwark of republic that without stand army their liberty can never be in danger nor with large one safe to promote by authorized mean improvement friendly to agriculture to manufacture and to external as well as internal commerce to favor in like manner the advancement of science and the diffusion of information as the good aliment to true liberty to carry on the benevolent plan which have be so meritoriously apply to the conversion of our aboriginal neighbor from the degradation and wretchedness of savage life to a participation of the improvement of which the human mind and manner be susceptible in a civilized state as far as sentiment and intention such as these can aid the fulfillment of my duty they will be a resource which can not fail i

 it be my good fortune moreover to have the path in which i be to tread light by example of illustrious service successfully render in the most try difficulty by those who have march before i of those of my immediate predecessor it might least become i here to speak i may however be pardon for not suppress the sympathy with which my heart be full in the rich reward he enjoy in the benediction of a beloved country gratefully bestow or exalt talent zealously devote through a long career to the advancement of its high interest and happiness

 but the source to which i look or the aid which alone can supply my deficiency be in the well try intelligence and virtue of my fellow citizen and in the counsel of those represent they in the other department associate in the care of the national interest in these my confidence will under every difficulty be well place next to that which we have all be encourage to feel in the guardianship and guidance of that almighty be whose power regulate the destiny of nation whose blessing have be so conspicuously dispense to this rise republic and to whom we be bind to address our devout gratitude for the past as well as our fervent supplication and good hope for the future

return to the scene of my birth and early life to the society of those with whom i be raise and who have be ever dear to i i receive fellow citizen and neighbor with inexpressible pleasure the cordial welcome you be so good as to give i long absent on duty which the history of a wonderful era make incumbent on those call to they the pomp the turmoil the bustle and splendor of office have draw but deep sigh for the tranquil and irresponsible occupation of private life for the enjoyment of an affectionate intercourse with you my neighbor and friend and the endearment of family love which nature have give we all as the sweetener of every hour for these i gladly lie down the distressing burthen of power and seek with my fellow citizen repose and safety under the watchful care the labor and perplexity of young and abler mind the anxiety you express to administer to my happiness do of themselves confer that happiness and the measure will be complete if my endeavor to fulfill my duty in the several public station to which i have be call have obtain for i the approbation of my country the part which i have act on the theatre of public life have be before they and to their sentence i submit it but the testimony of my native country of the individual who have know i in private life to my conduct in its various duty and relation be the more grateful as proceed from eye witness and observer from trier of the vicinage of you then my neighbor i may ask in the face of the world whose ox have i take or whom have defraud whom have i oppress or of whose hand have i receive a bribe to blind mine eye therewith on your verdict i rest with conscious security your wish for my happiness be receive with just sensibility and i offer sincere prayer for your own welfare and prosperity
fellow citizen of the senate and of the house of representatives on this first occasion of meet you it afford i much satisfaction to be able to communicate the commencement of a favorable change in our foreign relation the critical state of which induce a session of congress at this early period in consequence of the provision of the act interdict commercial intercourse with great britain and france our minister at london and paris be without delay instruct to let it be understand by the french and british government that the authority vest in the executive to renew commercial intercourse with their respective nation would be exercise in the case specify by that act soon after these instruction be dispatch it be find that the british government anticipate from early proceeding of congress at their last session the state of our law which have have the effect of place the two belligerent power on a footing of equal restriction and rely on the conciliatory disposition of the united states have transmit to their legation here provisional instruction not only to offer satisfaction for the attack on the frigate chesapeake and to make know the determination of his britannic majesty to send an envoy extraordinary with power to conclude a treaty on all the point between the two country but moreover to signify his willingness in the meantime to withdraw his order in council in the persuasion that the intercourse with great britain would be renew on the part of the united states these step of the british government lead to the correspondence and the proclamation now lay before you by virtue of which the commerce between the two country will be renewable after the 10th day of june next whilst i take pleasure in do justice to the council of his britannic majesty which no long adhere to the policy which make an abandonment by france of her decree a prerequisite to a revocation of the british order have substitute the amicable course which have issue thus happily i can not do less than refer to the proposal heretofore make on the part of the united states embrace a like restoration of the suspend commerce as a proof of the spirit of accommodation which at no time be intermit and to the result which now call for our congratulation as corroborate the principle by which the public council have be guide during a period of the most try embarrassment the discontinuance of the british order as they respect the united states having be thus arrange a communication of the event have be forward in one of our public vessel to our minister plenipotentiary at paris with instruction to avail himself of the important addition thereby make to the consideration which press on the justice of the french government a revocation of its decree or such a modification of they as that they shall cease to violate the neutral commerce of the united states the revision of our commercial law proper to adapt they to the arrangement which have take place with great britain will doubtless engage the early attention of congress it will be worthy at the same time of their lust and provident care to make such further alteration in the law as will more especially protect and foster the several branch of manufacture which have be recently institute or extend by the laudable exertion of our citizen under the exist aspect of our affair i have think it not inconsistent with a just precaution to have the gunboat with the exception of those at new orleans place in a situation incur no expense beyond that requisite for their preservation and conveniency for future service and to have the crew of those at new orleans reduce to the number require for their navigation and safety i have think also that our citizen detach in quota of militia amount to 100,000 under the act of march 1808 might not improperly be relieve from the state in which they be hold for immediate service a discharge of they have be accordingly direct the progress make in raise and organize the additional military force for which provision be make by the act of april 1808 together with the disposition of the troop will appear by a report which the secretary of war be prepare and which will be lay before you of the additional frigate require by an act of the last session to be fit for actual service two be in readiness one nearly so and the fourth be expect to be ready in the month of july a report which the secretary of the navy be prepare on the subject to be lay before congress will shew at the same time the progress make in officer and man these ship it will shew also the degree in which the provision of the act relate to the other public armed ship have be carry into execution it will rest with the judgment of congress to decide how far the change in our external prospect may authorize any modification of the law relate to the army and navy establishment the work of defense for our seaport town and harbor have proceed with as much activity as the season of the year and other circumstance would admit it be necessary however to state that the appropriation hitherto make be find to be deficient a further provision will claim the early consideration of congress the whole of the 8 per cent stock remain due by the united states amount to $ 5,300,000 have be reimburse on the last day of the year 1808 and on the 1st day of april last the sum in the treasury exceed $ 9,500,000 this together with the receipt of the current year on account of former revenue bond will probably be nearly if not altogether sufficient to defray the expense of the year but the suspension of export and the consequent decrease of importation during the last twelve month will necessarily cause a great diminution in the receipt of the year 1810 after that year should our foreign relation be undisturbed the revenue will again be more than commensurate to all the expenditure aware of the inconvenience of a protract session at the present season of the year i forbear to call the attention of the legislature to any matter not particularly urgent it remain therefore only to assure you of the fidelity and alacrity with which i shall cooperate for the welfare and happiness of our country and to pray that it may experience a continuance of the divine blessing by which it have be so signally favor james madison
  fellow citizens of the senate and of the house of representatives at the period of our last meeting i have the satisfaction of communicate an adjustment with one of the principal belligerent nation highly important in itself and still more so as presage a more extended accommodation it be with deep concern i be now to inform you that the favorable prospect have be over clouded by a refusal of the british government to abide by the act of its minister plenipotentiary and by its ensue policy toward the united states as see through the communication of the minister send to replace he   whatever plea may be urge for a disavowal of engagement form by diplomatic functionary in case where by the term of the engagement a mutual ratification be reserve or where notice at the time may have be give of a departure from instruction or in extraordinary case essentially violate the principle of equity a disavowal could not have be apprehend in a case where no such notice or violation exist where no such ratification be reserve and more especially where as be now in proof an engagement to be execute without any such ratification be contemplate by the instruction give and where it have with good faith be carry into immediate execution on the part of the united states these consideration not having restrain the british government from disavow the arrangement by virtue of which its order in council be to be revoke and the event authorize the renewal of commercial intercourse having thus not take place it necessarily become a question of equal urgency and importance whether the act prohibit that intercourse be not to be consider as remain in legal force this question be after due deliberation determine in the affirmative a proclamation to that effect be issue it could not but happen however that a return to this state of thing from that which have follow an execution of the arrangement by the united states would involve difficulty with a view to diminish these as much as possible the instruction from the secretary of the treasury now lay before you be transmit to the collector of the several port if in permit british vessel to depart without give bond not to proceed to their own port it should appear that the tenor of legal authority have not be strictly pursue it be to be ascribe to the anxious desire which be feel that no individual should be injure by so unforeseen an occurrence and i rely on the regard of congress for the equitable interest of our own citizen to adopt whatever further provision may be find requisite for a general remission of penalty involuntarily incur the recall of the disavowed minister having be follow by the appointment of a successor hope be indulge that the new mission would contribute to alleviate the disappointment which have be produce and to remove the cause which have so long embarrass the good understanding of the two nation it could not be doubt that it would at least be charge with conciliatory explanation of the step which have be take and with proposal to be substitute for the reject arrangement reasonable and universal as this expectation be it also have not be fulfil from the first official disclosure of the new minister it be find that he have receive no authority to enter into explanation relative to either branch of the arrangement disavow nor any authority to substitute proposal as to that branch which concern the british order in council and finally that his proposal wrt the other branch the attack on the frigate chesapeake be found on a presumption repeatedly declare to be inadmissible by the united states that the first step toward adjustment be due from they the proposal at the same time omit even a reference to the officer answerable for the murderous aggression and assert a claim not less contrary to the british law and british practice than to the principle and obligation of the united states the correspondence between the department of state and this minister will show how unessentially the feature present in its commencement have be varied in its progress it will sow also that forget the respect due to all government he do not refrain from imputation on this which require that no further communication should be receive from he the necessity of this step will be make known to his britannic majesty through the minister plenipotentiary of the united states in london and it would indicate a want of the confidence due to a government which so well understand and exact what become foreign minister near it not to infer

  fellow citizens of the senate and of the house of representatives the embarrassment which have prevail in our foreign relation and so much employ the deliberation of congress make it a primary duty in meet you to communicate whatever may have occur in that branch of our national affair   the act of the last session of congress concern the commercial intercourse between the united states and great britain and france and their dependency having invite in a new form a termination of their edict against our neutral commerce copy of the act be immediately forward to our minister at london and paris with a view that its object might be within the early attention of the french and british governments   by the communication receive through our minister at paris it appear that knowledge of the act by the french government be follow by a declaration that the berlin and milan decree be revoke and would cease to have effect on the first day of november ensue these be the only know edict of france within the description of the act and the revocation of they be such that they cease at that date to violate our neutral commerce the fact as prescribe by law be announce by a proclamation bearing date the 2nd of november   it would have well accord with the conciliatory view indicate by this proceeding on the part of france to have extend they to all the ground of just complaint which now remain unadjusted with the united states it be particularly anticipate that as a further evidence of just disposition toward they restoration would have be immediately make of the property of our citizen under a misapplication of the principle of reprisal combine with a misconstruction of a law of the united states this expectation have not be fulfil   from the british government no communication on the subject of the act have be receive to a communication from our minister at london of a revocation by the french government of its berlin and milan decree it be answer that the british system would be relinquish as soon as the repeal of the french decree should have actually take effect and the commerce of neutral nation have be restore to the condition in which it stand previously to the promulgation of those decree this pledge although it do not necessarily import do not exclude the intention of relinquish along with the other in council the practice of those novel blockade which have a like effect of interrupt our neutral commerce and this further justice to the united states be the rather to be look for in as much as the blockade in question be not more contrary to the established law of nation than inconsistent with the rule of blockade formally recognize by great britain herself could have no allege basis other than the plea of retaliation allege as the basis of the order in council   under the modification of the original order of 1807 november into the order of 1809 april there be indeed scarcely a nominal distinction between the order and the blockade one of those illegitimate blockade bear date in 1806 may having be expressly avow to be still unrescinde and to be in effect comprehend in the order in council be too distinctly bring within the purview of the act of congress not to be comprehend in the explanation of the requisite to a compliance with it the british government be accordingly apprise by our minister near it that such be the light in which the subject be to be regard   on the other important subject depend between the united states and the government no progress have be make from which an early and satisfactory result can be rely on   in this new posture of our relation with those power the consideration of congress will be properly turn to a removal of doubt which may occur in the exposition and of difficulty in the execution of the act above cite   the commerce of the united states with the north of europe heretofore much vex by licentious cruiser particularly under the danish flag have latterly be visit with fresh and extensive depredation the measure pursue in behalf of our injured citizen not having obtain justice for they a further and more formal interposition with the danish government be contemplate the principle which have be maintain by that government in relation to neutral commerce and the friendly profession of his danish majesty toward the united states be valuable pledge in favor of a successful issue   among the event grow out of the state of the spanish monarchy our attention be imperiously attract to the change develop itself in that portion of west florida which though of right appertaining to the united states have remain in the possession of spain await the result of negotiation for its actual delivery to they the spanish authority be subvert and a situation produce expose the country to ulterior event which might essentially affect the right and welfare of the union in such a conjuncture i do not delay the interposition require for the occupancy of the territory west of the river perdido to which the title of the united states extend and to which the law provide for the territory of orleans be applicable with this view the proclamation of which a copy be lay before you be confide to the governor of that territory to be carry into effect the legality and necessity of the course pursue assure i of the favorable light in which it will present itself to the legislature and of the promptitude with which they will supply whatever provision may be due to the essential right and equitable interest of the people thus bring into the bosom of the american family   our amity with the power of barbary with the exception of a recent occurrence at tunis of which an explanation be just receive appear to have be uninterrupted and to have become more firmly establish   with the indian tribe also the peace and friendship of the united states be find to be so eligible that the general disposition to preserve both continue to gain strength   i feel particular satisfaction in remark that an interior view of our country present we with grateful proof of its substantial and increase prosperity to a thrive agriculture and the improvement relate to it be add a highly interesting extension of useful manufacture the combined product of professional occupation and of household industry such indeed be the experience of economy as well as of policy in these substitute for supply heretofore obtain by foreign commerce that in a national view the change be justly regard as of itself more than a recompense for those privation and loss result from foreign injustice which furnish the general impulse require for its accomplishment how far it may be expedient to guard the infancy of this improvement in the distribution of labor by regulation of the commercial tariff be a subject which can not fail to suggest itself to your patriotic reflection   it will rest with the consideration of congress also whether a provident as well as fair encouragement would not be give to our navigation by such regulation as would place it on a level of competition with foreign vessel particularly in transport the important and bulky production of our own soil the failure of equality and reciprocity in the exist regulation on this subject operate in our port as a premium to foreign competitor and the inconvenience must increase as these may be multiply under more favorable circumstance by the more than countervail encouragement now give they by the law of their respective country   whilst it be universally admit that a well instruct people alone can be permanently a free people and whilst it be evident that the mean of diffuse and improve useful knowledge form so small a proportion of the expenditure for national purpose i can not presume it to be unseasonable to invite your attention to the advantage of superadde to the mean of education provide by the several states a seminary of learn institute by the national legislature within the limit of their exclusive jurisdiction the expense of which might be defray or reimburse out of the vacant ground which have accrue to the nation within those limit   such an institution though local in its legal character would be universal in its beneficial effect by enlighten the opinion by expand the patriotism and by assimilate the principle the sentiment and the manner of those who might resort to this temple of science to be redistribute in due time through every part of the community source of jealousy and prejudice would be diminish the feature of national character would be multiply and great extent give to social harmony but above all a well- constitute seminary in the center of the nation be recommend by the consideration that the additional instruction emanating from it would contribute not less to strengthen the foundation than to adorn the structure of our free and happy system of government   among the commercial abuse still commit under the american flag and leave in force my former reference to that subject it appear that american citizen be instrumental in carry on a traffic in enslave africans equally in violation of the law of humanity and in defiance of those of their own country the same just and benevolent motive which produce interdiction in force against this criminal conduct will doubtless be feel by congress in devise further mean of suppress the evil   in the midst of uncertainty necessarily connect with the great interest of the united states prudence require a continuance of our defensive and precautionary arrangement the secretary of war and secretary of the navy will submit the statement and estimate which may aid congress in their ensue provision for the land and naval force the statement of the latter will include a view of the transfer of appropriation in the naval expenditure and in the ground on which they be make   the fortification for the defense of our maritime frontier have be prosecute accord to the plan lay down in 1808 the work with some exception be complete and furnish with ordnance those for the security of the city of new york though far advanced toward completion will require a further time and appropriation this be the case with a few other either not complete or in need of repair   the improvement in quality and quantity make in the manufacture of cannon and small arm both at the public armory and private factory warrant additional confidence in the competency of these resource for supply the public exigency   these preparation for arm the militia having thus far provide for 1 of the object contemplate by the power vest in congress with respect to that great bulwark of the public safety it be for their consideration whether further provision be not requisite for the other contemplated object of organization and discipline to give to this great mass of physical and moral force the efficiency which it merit and be capable of receive it be indispensable that they should be instruct and practice in the rule by which they be to be govern toward an accomplishment of this important work i recommend for the consideration of congress the expediency of institute a system which shall in the first instance call into the field at the public expense and for a give time certain portion of the commission and non commission officer the instruction and discipline thus acquire would gradually diffuse through the entire body of the militia that practical knowledge and promptitude for active service which be the great end to be pursue experience have leave no doubt either of the necessity or of the efficacy of competent military skill in those portion of an army in fit it for the final duty which it may have to perform   the corps of engineers with the military academy be entitle to the early attention of congress the building at the seat fix by law for the present academy be so far in decay as not to afford the necessary accommodation but a revision of the law be recommend principally with a view to a more enlarged cultivation and diffusion of the advantage of such institution by provide professorship for all the necessary branch of military instruction and by the establishment of an additional academy at the seat of government or elsewhere the mean by which war as well for defense as for offense be now carry on render these school of the more scientific operation an indispensable part of every adequate system   even among nation whose large stand army and frequent war afford every other opportunity of instruction these establishment be find to be indispensable for the due attainment of the branch of military science which require a regular course of study and experiment in a government happily without the other opportunity seminary where the elementary principle of the art of war can be teach without actual war and without the expense of extensive and standing army have the precious advantage of unite an essential preparation against external danger with a scrupulous regard to internal safety in no other way probably can a provision of equal efficacy for the public defense be make at so little expense or more consistently with the public liberty   the receipt into the treasury during the year end on the 30th of september last and amount to more than $ 8.5 m have exceed the current expense of the government include the interest on the public debt for the purpose of reimburse at the end of the year $ 3.75 of the principal a loan as authorize by law have be negotiate to that amount but have since be reduce to $ 2.75 m the reduction be permit by the state of the treasury in which there will be a balance remain at the end of the year estimate at $ 2m. for the probably receipt of the next year and other detail i refer to statement which will be transmit from the treasury and which will enable you to judge what further provision may be necessary for the ensue year   reserving for future occasion in the course of the session whatever other communication may claim your attention i close the present by express my reliance under the blessing of divine providence on the judgement and patriotism which will guide your measure at a period particularly call for united council and flexible exertion for the welfare of our country and by assure you of the fidelity and alacrity with which my cooperation will be afford
having examine and consider the bill entitle an act incorporate the protestant episcopal church in the town of alexandria in the district of columbia i now return the bill to the house of representatives in which it originate with the follow objection because the bill exceed the rightful authority to which government be limit by the essential distinction between civil and religious function and violate in particular the article of the constitution of the united states which declare that congress shall make no law respect a religious establishment the bill enact into and establishe by law sundry rule and proceeding relative purely to the organization and polity of the church incorporate and comprehend even the election and removal of the minister of the same so that no change could be make therein by the particular society or by the general church of which it be a member and whose authority it recognize this particular church therefore would so far be a religious establishment by law a legal force and sanction be give to certain article in its constitution and administration nor can it be consider that the article thus establish be to be take as the descriptive criterion only of the corporate identity of the society in as much as this identity must depend on other characteristic as the regulation establish be generally unessential and alterable accord to the principle and cannon by which church of that denomination govern themselves and as the injunction prohibition contain in the regulation would be enforce by the penal consequence applicable to a violation of they accord to the local law because the bill vest in the say incorporate church an authority to provide for the support of the poor and the education of poor child of the same an authority which be altogether superfluous if the provision be to be the result of pious charity would be a precident for give to religious societies as such a legal agency in carry into effect a public and civil duty
fellow citizens of the senate and of the house of representatives in call you together soon than a separation from your home would otherwise have be require i yield to consideration draw from the posture of our foreign affair and in fix the present for the time of your meeting regard be have to the probability of further development of the policy of the belligerent power toward this country which might the more unite the national council in the measure to be pursue   at the close of the last session of congress it be hope that the successive confirmation of the extinction of the french decree so far as they violate our neutral commerce would have induce the government of great britain to repeal its order in council and thereby authorize a removal of the exist obstruction to her commerce with the united states   instead of this reasonable step toward satisfaction and friendship between the two nation the order be at a moment when least to have be expect put into more rigorous execution and it be communicate through the british envoy just arrive that whilst the revocation of the edict of france as officially make known to the british government be deny to have take place it be an indispensable condition of the repeal of the british order that commerce should restore to a footing that would admit the production and manufacture of great britain when own by neutral into market shut against they by her enemy the united states be give to understand that in the mean time a continuance of their nonimportation act would lead to measure of retaliation   at a later date it have indeed appear that a communication to the british government of fresh evidence of the repeal of the french decree against our neutral trade be follow by an intimation that it have be transmit to the british plenipotentiary here in order that it might receive full consideration in the depend discussion this communication appear not to have be receive but the transmission of it hither instead of found on it an actual repeal of the order or assurance that the repeal would ensue will not permit we to rely on any effective change in the british cabinet to be ready to meet with cordiality satisfactory proof of such a change and to proceed in the mean time in adapt our measure to the view which have be disclose through that minister will well consult our whole duty   in the unfriendly spirit of those disclosure indemnity and redress for other wrong have continue to be withhold and our coast and the mouth of our harbor have again witness scene not less derogatory to the dearest of our national right than vexation to the regular course of our trade   among the occurrence produce by the conduct of british ship of war hover on our coast be an encounter between 1 of they and the american frigate command by captain rodgers render unavoidable on the part of the latter by a fire commence without cause by the former whose commander be therefore alone chargeable with the blood unfortunately shed in maintain the honor of the american flag the proceeding of a court of inquiry request by captain rodgers be communicate together with the correspondence relate to the occurrence between the secretary of state and his britannic majesty 's envoy to these be add the several correspondence which have pass on the subject of the british order in council and to both the correspondence relate to the floridas in which congress will be make acquainted with the interposition which the government of great britain have think proper to make against the proceeding of the united states   the justice and fairness which have be evince on the part of the united states toward france both before and since the revocation of her decree authorize an expectation that her government would have follow up that measure by all such other as be due to our reasonable claim as well s dictate by its amicable profession no proof however be yet give of an intention to repair the other wrong do to the united states and particularly to restore the great amount of american property seize and condemn under edict which though not affect our neutral relation and therefore not enter into question between the united states and other belligerent be nevertheless found in such unjust principle that the reparation ought to have be prompt and ample   in addition to this and other demand of strict right on that nation the united states have much reason to be dissatisfied with the rigorous and unexpected restriction to which their trade with the french dominion have be subject and which if not discontinue will require at least correspond restriction on importation from france into the united states   on all those subject our minister plenipotentiary lately send to paris have carry with he the necessary instruction the result of which will be communicate to you by ascertain the ulterior policy of the french government toward the united states will enable you to adapt to it that of the united states toward france   our other foreign relation remain without unfavorable change with russia they be on the good footing of friendship the port of sweden have afford proof of friendly disposition toward our commerce in the council of that nation also and the information from our special minister to denmark shews that the mission have be attend with valuable effect to our citizen whose property have be so extensively violate and endanger by cruiser under the danish flag   under the ominous indication which command attention it become a duty to exert the mean commit to the executive department in provide for the general security the work of defense on our maritime frontier have accordingly be prosecute with an activity leave little to be add for the completion of the most important one and as particularly suit for cooperation in emergency a portion of the gun boat have in particular harbor be order into use the ship of war before in commission with the addition of a frigate have be chiefly employ as a cruise guard to the right of our coast and such a disposition have be make of our land force as be think to promise the service most appropriate and important   in this disposition be include a force consist of regular and militia embody in the indiana territory and march toward our northwestern frontier this measure be make requisite by several murder and depredation commit by indians but more especially by the menacing preparation and aspect of a combination of they on the wabash under the influence and direction of a fanatic of the shawanese tribe with these exception the indian tribe retain their peaceable disposition toward we and their usual pursuit   i must now add that the period be arrive which claim from the legislative guardian of the national right a system of more ample provision for maintain they notwithstanding the scrupulous justice the protract moderation and the multiply effort on the part of the united states to substitute for the accumulate danger to the peace of the 2 country all the mutual advantage of reestablished friendship and confidence we have see that the british cabinet persevere not only in withhold a remedy for other wrong so long and so loudly call for it but in the execution bring home to the threshold of our territory of measure which under exist circumstance have the character as well as the effect of war on our lawful commerce   with this evidence of hostile inflexibility in trample on right which no independent nation can relinquish congress will feel the duty of put the united states into an armor and an attitude demand by the crisis and correspond with the national spirit and expectation   i recommend accordingly that adequate provision be make for fill the rank and prolong the enlistment of the regular troop for an auxiliary force to be engage for a more limited term for the acceptance of volunteer corps whose patriotic ardor may court a participation in urgent service for detachment as they may be want of other portion of the militia and for such a preparation of the great body as will proportion its usefulness to its intrinsic capacity nor can the occasion fail to remind you of the importance of those military seminary which in every event will form a valuable and frugal part of our military establishment   the manufacture of cannon and small arm have proceed with due success and the stock and resource of all the necessary munition be adequate to emergency it will not be inexpedient however for congress to authorize an enlargement of they   your attention will of course be draw to such provision on the subject of our naval force as may be require for the service to which it may be well adapt i submit to congress the seasonableness also of an authority to augment the stock of such material as be imperishable in their nature or may not at once be attainable   in contemplate the scene which distinguish this momentous epoch and estimate their claim to our attention it be impossible to overlook those develop themselves among the great community which occupy the southern portion of our own hemisphere and extend into our neighborhood an enlarged philanthropy and an enlighten forecast concur in impose on the national council an obligation to take a deep interest in their destiny to cherish reciprocal sentiment of good will to regard the progress of event and not to be unprepared for whatever order of thing may be ultimately establish   under another aspect of our situation the early attention of congress will be due to the expediency of further guard against evasion and infraction of our commercial law the practice of smuggling which be odious everywhere and particularly criminal in free government where the law be make by all for the good of all a fraud be commit on every individual as well as on the state attain its utmost guilt when it blend with a pursuit of ignominious gain a treacherous subserviency in the transgressor to a foreign policy adverse to that of their own country it be they that the virtuous indignation of the public should be enable to manifest itself through the regular animadversion of the most competent law   to secure great respect to our mercantile flag and to the honest interest which it cover it be expedient also that it be make punishable in our citizen to accept license from foreign government for a trade unlawfully interdict by they to other american citizen or to trade under false color or paper of any sort   a prohibition be equally call for against the acceptance by our citizen of special license to be use in a trade with the united states and against the admission into particular port of the united states of vessel from foreign country authorize to trade with particular port only   although other subject will press more immediately on your deliberation a portion of they can not but be well bestow on the just and sound policy of securing to our manufacture the success they have attain and be still attain in some degree under the impulse of cause not permanent and to our navigation the fair extent of which be at present abridge by the unequal regulation of foreign government   besides the reasonableness of save our manufacture from sacrifice which a change of circumstance might bring on they the national interest require that wrt such article at least as belong to our defense and our primary want we should not be leave in unnecessary dependence on external supply and whilst foreign government adhere to the exist discrimination in their port against our navigation and an equality or less discrimination be enjoy by their navigation in our port the effect can not be mistaken because it have be seriously feel by our shipping interest and in proportion as this take place the advantage of an independent conveyance of our product to foreign market and of a grow body of mariner train by their occupation for the service of their country in time of danger must be diminish   the receipt into the treasury during the year end on the 30th day of september last have exceed $ 13.5 m and have enable we to defray the current expense include the interest on the public debt and to reimburse more than $ 5 m of the principal without recur to the loan authorize by the act of the last session the temporary loan obtain in the latter end of the year 1810 have also be reimburse and be not include in that amount   the decrease of revenue arise from the situation of our commerce and the extraordinary expense which have and may become necessary must be take into view in make commensurate provision for the ensue year and i recommend to your consideration the propriety of insure a sufficiency of annual revenue at least to defray the ordinary expense of government and to pay the interest on the public debt include that on new loan which may be authorize   i can not close this communication without express my deep sense of the crisis in which you be assemble my confidence in a wise and honorable result to your deliberation and assurance of the faithful zeal with which my cooperate duty will be discharge invoke at the same time the blessing of heaven on our beloved country and on all the mean that may be employ in vindicate its right and advance its welfare

great    britain without go back beyond the renewal in 1803 of the war in which great    britain be engage and omit unrepaire wrong of inferior magnitude    the conduct of her government present a series of act hostile to the    united states as an independent and neutral nation british cruiser have be in the continued practice of violate the    american flag on the great highway of nation and of seize and carry    off person sail under it not in the exercise of a belligerent right    found on the law of nation against an enemy but of a municipal    prerogative over british subject british jurisdiction be thus extend to    neutral vessel in a situation where no law can operate but the law of    nation and the law of the country to which the vessel belong and a self redress be assume which if british subject be wrongfully detain and    alone concern be that substitution of force for a resort to the    responsible sovereign which fall within the definition of war could the    seizure of british subject in such case be regard as within the exercise    of a belligerent right the acknowledge law of war which forbid an    article of capture property to be adjudge without a regular investigation    before a competent tribunal would imperiously demand the fairest trial    where the sacred right of person be at issue in place of such a trial    these right be subject to the will of every petty commander the practice hence be so far from affect british subject alone that    under the pretext of search for these thousand of american citizen    under the safeguard of public law and of their national flag have be tear    from their country and from everything dear to they have be drag on    board ship of war of a foreign nation and expose under the severity of    their discipline to be exile to the most distant and deadly clime to    risk their life in the battle of their oppressor and to be the    melancholy instrument of take away those of their own brother against this cry enormity which great britain would be so prompt to    avenge if commit against herself the united states have in vain    exhausted remonstrance and expostulation and that no proof might be    want of their conciliatory disposition and no pretext leave for a    continuance of the practice the british government be formally assure of    the readiness of the united states to enter into arrangement such as could    not be reject if the recovery of british subject be the real and the    sole object the communication pass without effect british cruiser have be in the practice also of violate the right and    the peace of our coast they hover over and harass our enter and    depart commerce to the most insulting pretension they have add the    most lawless proceeding in our very harbor and have wantonly spill    american blood within the sanctuary of our territorial jurisdiction the    principle and rule enforce by that nation when a neutral nation against    armed vessel of belligerent hover near her coast and disturb her    commerce be well know when call on nevertheless by the united states    to punish the great offense commit by her own vessel her government    have bestow on their commander additional mark of honor and confidence under pretended blockade without the presence of an adequate force and    sometimes without the practicability of apply one our commerce have be    plunder in every sea the great staple of our country have be cut off    from their legitimate market and a destructive blow aim at our    agricultural and maritime interest in aggravation of these predatory    measure they have be consider as in force from the date of their    notification a retrospective effect be thus add as have be do in    other important case to the unlawfulness of the course pursue and to    render the outrage the more signal these mock blockade have be reiterate    and enforce in the face of official communication from the british government declare as the true definition of a legal blockade that    particular port must be actually invest and previous warning give to    vessel bind to they not to enter "not content with these occasional expedient for lay waste our neutral    trade the cabinet of britain resort at length to the sweeping system of    blockade under the name of order in council which have be mold and    manage as might well suit its political view its commercial jealousy    or the avidity of british cruiser to our remonstrance against the complicated and transcendent injustice of    this innovation the first reply be that the order be reluctantly adopt    by great britain as a necessary retaliation on decree of her enemy    proclaim a general blockade of the british isles at a time when the naval    force of that enemy dare not issue from his own port she be remind    without effect that her own prior blockade unsupported by an adequate    naval force actually apply and continue be a bar to this plea that    execute edict against million of our property could not be retaliation on    edict confessedly impossible to be execute that retaliation to be just    should fall on the party set the guilty example not on an innocent    party which be not even chargeable with an acquiescence in it when deprive of this flimsy veil for a prohibition of our trade with her    enemy by the repeal of his prohibition of our trade with great britain her    cabinet instead of a corresponding repeal or a practical discontinuance of    its order formally avow a determination to persist in they against the    united states until the market of her enemy should be lay open to british    product thus assert an obligation on a neutral power to require one    belligerent to encourage by its internal regulation the trade of another    belligerent contradict her own practice toward all nation in peace as    well as in war and betray the insincerity of those profession which    inculcate a belief that having resort to her order with regret she be    anxious to find an occasion for put an end to they abandon still more all respect for the neutral right of the united    states and for its own consistency the british government now demand as    prerequisite to a repeal of its order as they relate to the united states    that a formality should be observe in the repeal of the french decree    nowise necessary to their termination nor exemplified by british usage and    that the french repeal besides include that portion of the decree which    operate within a territorial jurisdiction as well as that which operate    on the high sea against the commerce of the united states should not be a    single and special repeal in relation to the united states but should be    extend to whatever other neutral nation unconnected with they may be    affect by those decree and as an additional insult they be call on    for a formal disavowal of condition and pretension advance by the french government for which the united states be so far from having make    themselves responsible that in official explanation which have be    publish to the world and in a correspondence of the american minister at    london with the british minister for foreign affair such a responsibility    be explicitly and emphatically disclaim it have become indeed sufficiently certain that the commerce of the united    states be to be sacrifice not as interfere with the belligerent right    of great britain not as supply the want of her enemy which she    herself supply but as interfere with the monopoly which she covet for    her own commerce and navigation she carry on a war against the lawful    commerce of a friend that she may the well carry on a commerce with an    enemy a commerce pollute by the forgery and perjury which be for the    most part the only passport by which it can succeed anxious to make every experiment short of the last resort of injured    nation the united states have withhold from great britain under    successive modification the benefit of a free intercourse with their    market the loss of which could not but outweigh the profit accrue from    her restriction of our commerce with other nation and to entitle these    experiment to the more favorable consideration they be so frame as to    enable she to place her adversary under the exclusive operation of they to    these appeal her government have be equally inflexible as if willing to    make sacrifice of every sort rather than yield to the claim of justice or    renounce the error of a false pride nay so far be the attempt carry    to overcome the attachment of the british cabinet to its unjust edict that    it receive every encouragement within the competency of the executive    branch of our government to expect that a repeal of they would be follow    by a war between the united states and france unless the french edict    should also be repeal even this communication although silence forever    the plea of a disposition in the united states to acquiesce in those edict    originally the sole plea for they receive no attention if no other proof exist of a predetermination of the british government    against a repeal of its order it might be find in the correspondence of    the minister plenipotentiary of the united states at london and the british    secretary for foreign affair in 1810 on the question whether the blockade    of may 1806 be consider as in force or as not in force it have be    ascertain that the french government which urge this blockade as the    ground of its berlin decree be willing in the event of its removal to    repeal that decree which be follow by alternate repeal of the other    offensive edict might abolish the whole system on both side this    invite opportunity for accomplish an object so important to the united    states and profess so often to be the desire of both the belligerent    be make known to the british government as that government admit that an    actual application of an adequate force be necessary to the existence of a    legal blockade and it be notorious that if such a force have ever be    apply its long discontinuance have annul the blockade in question there    could be no sufficient objection on the part of great britain to a formal    revocation of it and no imaginable objection to a declaration of the fact    that the blockade do not exist the declaration would have be consistent    with her avow principle of blockade and would have enable the united    states to demand from france the pledge repeal of her decree either with    success in which case the way would have be open for a general repeal    of the belligerent edict or without success in which case the united    states would have be justify in turn their measure exclusively    against france the british government would however neither rescind the    blockade nor declare its nonexistence nor permit its non existence to be    infer and affirm by the american plenipotentiary on the contrary by    represent the blockade to be comprehend in the order in council the    united states be compel so to regard it in their subsequent    proceeding there be a period when a favorable change in the policy of the british    cabinet be justly consider as establish the minister plenipotentiary    of his britannic majesty here propose an adjustment of the difference more    immediately endanger the harmony of the two country the proposition    be accept with the promptitude and cordiality correspond with the    invariable profession of this government a foundation appear to be lay    for a sincere and last reconciliation the prospect however quickly    vanish the whole proceeding be disavow by the british government    without any explanation which could at that time repress the belief that    the disavowal proceed from a spirit of hostility to the commercial right    and prosperity of the united states and it have since come into proof that    at the very moment when the public minister be hold the language of    friendship and inspire confidence in the sincerity of the negotiation with    which he be charge a secret agent of his government be employ in    intrigue have for their object a subversion of our government and a    dismemberment of our happy union in review the conduct of great britain toward the united states our    attention be necessarily draw to the warfare just renew by the savage on    one of our extensive frontier a warfare which be know to spare neither    age nor sex and to be distinguish by feature peculiarly shocking to    humanity it be difficult to account for the activity and combination which    have for some time be develop themselves among tribe in constant    intercourse with british trader and garrison without connect their    hostility with that influence and without recollect the authenticated    example of such interposition heretofore furnish by the officer and    agent of that government such be the spectacle of injury and indignity which have be heap on    our country and such the crisis which its unexampled forbearance and    conciliatory effort have not be able to avert it might at least have    be expect that an enlightened nation if less urge by moral obligation    or invite by friendly disposition on the part of the united states would    have find its true interest alone a sufficient motive to respect their    right and their tranquillity on the high sea that an enlarged policy    would have favor that free and general circulation of commerce in which    the british nation be at all time interested and which in time of war be    the good alleviation of its calamity to herself as well as to other    belligerent and more especially that the british cabinet would not for    the sake of a precarious and surreptitious intercourse with hostile market    have persevere in a course of measure which necessarily put at hazard the    invaluable market of a great and grow country dispose to cultivate the    mutual advantage of an active commerce other counsel have prevail our moderation and conciliation have have no    other effect than to encourage perseverance and to enlarge pretension we    behold our seafaring citizen still the daily victim of lawless violence    commit on the great common and highway of nation even within sight of    the country which owe they protection we behold our vessel freight    with the product of our soil and industry or return with the honest    proceed of they wrest from their lawful destination confiscate by    prize court no long the organ of public law but the instrument of    arbitrary edict and their unfortunate crew disperse and lose or force    or inveigle in british port into british fleet whilst argument be    employ in support of these aggression which have no foundation but in a    principle equally support a claim to regulate our external commerce in    all case whatsoever we behold in fine on the side of great britain a state of war against the    united states and on the side of the united states a state of peace toward    great britain whether the united states shall continue passive under these progressive    usurpation and these accumulate wrong or oppose force to force in    defense of their national right shall commit a just cause into the hand    of the almighty disposer of event avoid all connection which might    entangle it in the contest or view of other power and preserve a    constant readiness to concur in an honorable re establishment of peace and    friendship be a solemn question which the constitution wisely confide to    the legislative department of the government in recommend it to their    early deliberation i be happy in the assurance that the decision will be    worthy the enlightened and patriotic council of a virtuous a free and a    powerful nation having present this view of the relation of the united states with great    britain and of the solemn alternative grow mg out of they i proceed to    remark that the communica tion last make to congress on the subject of our    relation with france will have shew that since the revocation of her    decree as they violate the neutral right of the united states her government have authorize illegal capture by its privateer and public    ship and that other outrage have be practise on our vessel and our    citizen it will have be see also that no indemnity have be provide or    satisfacto rily pledge for the extensive spoliation commit under the    violent and retrospective order of the french government against the    property of our citizen seize within the jurisdic tion of france i abstain    at this time from recommend to the consideration of congress definitive    measure with re spect to that nation in the expectation that the result of    un close discussion between our minister plenipotentiary at paris and the    french government will speedily enable congress to decide with great    advantage on the course due to the right the interest and the honor of    our

fellow citizens of the senate and of the house of representatives on our present meeting it be my first duty to invite your attention to the providential favor which our country have experience in the unusual degree of health dispense to its inhabitant and in the rich abundance with which the earth have reward the labor bestow on it in the successful cultivation of other branch of industry and in the progress of general improvement favorable to the national prosperity there be just occasion also for our mutual congratulation and thankfulness with these blessing be necessarily mingle the pressure and vicissitude incident to the state of war into which the united states have be force by the perseverance of a foreign power in its system of injustice and aggression previous to its declaration it be deem proper as a measure of precaution and forecast that a considerable force should be place in the michigan territory with a general view to its security and in the event of war to such operation in the uppermost canada as would intercept the hostile influence of great britain over the savage obtain the command of the lake on which that part of canada border and maintain cooperate relation with such force as might be most conveniently employ against other part brigadier general hull be charge with this provisional service have under his command a body of troop compose of regular and of volunteer from the state of ohio having reach his destination after his knowledge of the war and possess discretionary authority to act offensively he pass into the neighbor territory of the enemy with a prospect of easy and victorious progress the expedition nevertheless terminate unfortunately not only in a retreat to the town and fort of detroit but in the surrender of both and of the gallant corps command by that officer the cause of this painful reverse will be investigate by a military tribunal a distinguish feature in the operation which precede and follow this adverse event be the use make by the enemy of the merciless savage under their influence whilst the benevolent policy of the united states invariably recommend peace and promote civilization among that wretched portion of the human race and be make exertion to dissuade they from take either side in the war the enemy have not scruple to call to his aid their ruthless ferocity arm with the horror of those instrument of carnage and torture which be know to spare neither age nor sex in this outrage against the law of honorable war and against the feeling sacred to humanity the british commander can not resort to a plea of retaliation for it be commit in the face of our example they can not mitigate it by call it a self defense against man in arm for it embrace the most shocking butchery of defenseless family nor can it be pretend that they be not answerable for the atrocity perpetrate since the savage be employ with a knowledge and even with menace that their fury could not be control such be the spectacle which the deputed authority of a nation boast its religion and morality have not be restrain from present to an enlightened age the misfortune at detroit be not however without a console effect it be follow by signal proof that the national spirit rise accord to the pressure on it the loss of an important post and of the brave man surrender with it inspire everywhere new ardor and determination in the states and district least remote it be no soon know than every citizen be ready to fly with his arm at once to protect his brother against the blood thirsty savage let loose by the enemy on an extensive frontier and to convert a partial calamity into a source of invigorated effort this patriotic zeal which it be necessary rather to limit than excite have embody an ample force from the states of kentucky and ohio and from part of pennsylvania and virginia it be place with the addition of a few regular under the command of brigadier general harrison who possess the entire confidence of his fellow soldier among whom be citizen some of they volunteer in the rank not less distinguished by their political station than by their personal merit the great portion of this force be proceed in relieve an important frontier post and in several incidental operation against hostile tribe of savage render indispensable by the subserviency into which they have be seduce by the enemy a seduction the more cruel as it could not fail to impose a necessity of precautionary severity against those who yield to it at a recent date an attack be make on a post of the enemy near niagara by a detachment of the regular and other force under the command of major general van rensselaer of the militia of the state of new york the attack it appear be order in compliance with the ardor of the troop who execute it with distinguished gallantry and be for a time victorious but not receive the expected support they be compel to yield to reenforcement of british regular and savage our loss have be considerable and be deeply to be lament that of the enemy less ascertain will be the more feel as it include among the kill the commanding general who be also the governor of the province and be sustain by veteran troop from unexperienced soldier who must daily improve in the duty of the field our expectation of gain the command of the lakes by the invasion of canada from detroit having be disappoint measure be instantly take to provide on they a naval force superior to that of the enemy from the talent and activity of the officer charge with this object everything that can be do may be expect should the present season not admit of complete success the progress make will insure for the next a naval ascendancy where it be essential to our permanent peace with and control over the savage among the incident to the measure of the war i be constrain to advert to the refusal of the governor of maine and connecticut to furnish the require detachment of militia toward the defense of the maritime frontier the refusal be found on a novel and unfortunate exposition of the provision of the constitution relate to the militia the correspondence which will be lay before you contain the requisite information on the subject it be obvious that if the authority of the united states to call into service and command the militia for the public defense can be thus frustrate even in a state of declare war and of course under apprehension of invasion precede war they be not one nation for the purpose most of all require it and that the public safety may have no other resource than in those large and permanent military establishment which be forbid by the principle of our free government and against the necessity of which the militia be mean to be a constitutional bulwark on the coast and on the ocean the war have be as successful as circumstance inseparable from its early stage could promise our public ship and private cruiser by their activity and where there be occasion by their intrepidity have make the enemy sensible of the difference between a reciprocity of capture and the long confinement of they to their side our trade with little exception have safely reach our port having be much favor in it by the course pursue by a squadron of our frigate under the command of commodore rodgers and in the instance in which skill and bravery be more particularly try with those of the enemy the american flag have an auspicious triumph the frigate constitution command by captain hull after a close and short engagement completely disabled and capture a british frigate gain for that officer and all on board a praise which can not be too liberally bestow not merely for the victory actually achieve but for that prompt and cool exertion of command talent which give to courage its high character and to the force apply its full effect prove that more could have be do in a contest require more anxious to abridge the evil from which a state of war can not be exempt i lose no time after it be declare in convey to the british government the term on which its progress might be arrest without await the delay of a formal and final pacification and our charge d'affaires at london be at the same time authorize to agree to an armistice found upon they these term require that the order in council should be repeal as they affect the united states without a revival of blockade violate acknowledge rule and that there should be an immediate discharge of american sea man from british ship and a stop to impressment from american ship with an understanding that an exclusion of the sea man of each nation from the ship of the other should be stipulate and that the armistice should be improve into a definitive and comprehensive adjustment of depend controversy although a repeal of the order susceptible of explanation meet the view of this government have take place before this pacific advance be communicate to that of great britain the advance be decline from an avow repugnance to a suspension of the practice of impressment during the armistice and without any intimation that the arrangement propose wrt sea man would be accept whether the subsequent communication from this government afford an occasion for reconsider the subject on the part of great britain will be view in a more favorable light or receive in a more accommodating spirit remain to be know it would be unwise to relax our measure in any respect on a presumption of such a result the document from the department of state which relate to this subject will give a view also of the proposition for an armistice which have be receive here one of they from the authority at halifax and in canada the other from the british government itself through admiral warren and of the ground on which neither of they could be accept our affair with france retain the posture which they hold at my last communication to you notwithstanding the authorized expectation of an early as well as favorable issue to the discussion on foot these have be procrastinate to the late date the only intervene occurrence merit attention be the promulgation of a french decree purport to be a definitive repeal of the berlin and milan decree this proceeding although make the ground of the repeal of the british order in council be render by the time and manner of it liable to many objection the final communication from our special minister to denmark afford further proof of the good effect of his mission and of the amicable disposition of the danish government from russia we have the satisfaction to receive assurance of continued friendship and that it will not be affect by the rupture between the united states and great britain sweden also profess sentiment favorable to the subsist harmony with the barbary powers except that of algiers our affair remain on the ordinary footing the consul general reside with that regency have suddenly and without cause be banish together with all the american citizen find there whether this be the transitory effect of capricious despotism or the first act of predetermine hostility be not ascertain precaution be take by the consul on the latter supposition the indian tribe not under foreign instigation remain at peace and receive the civilize attention which have prove so beneficial to they with a view to that vigorous prosecution of the war to which our national faculty be adequate the attention of congress will be particularly draw to the insufficiency of exist provision for fill up the military establishment such be the happy condition of our country arise from the facility of subsistence and the high wage for every specie of occupation that notwithstanding the augmented inducement provide at the last session a partial success only have attend the recruiting service the deficiency have be necessarily supply during the campaign by other than regular troop with all the inconvenience and expense incident to they the remedy lie in establish more favorably for the private soldier the proportion between his recompense and the term of his enlistment and it be a subject which can not too soon or too seriously be take into consideration the same insufficiency have be experience in the provision for volunteer make by an act of the last session the recompense for the service require in this case be still less attractive than in the other and although patriotism alone have send into the field some valuable corp of that description those alone who can afford the sacrifice can be reasonably expect to yield to that impulse it will merit consideration also whether as auxiliary to the security of our frontier corp may not be advantageously organize with a restriction of their service to particular district convenient to they and whether the local and occasional service of mariner and other in the sea port town under a similar organization would not be a provident addition to the mean of their defense i recommend a provision for an increase of the general officer of the army the deficiency of which have be illustrate by the and distance of separate command which the course of the war and the advantage of the service have require and i can not press too strongly on the early attention of the legislature the importance of the reorganization of the staff establishment with a view to render more distinct and definite the relation and responsibility of its several department that there be room for improvement which will materially promote both economy and success in what appertain to the army and the war be equally inculcate by the example of other country and by the experience of our own a revision of the militia law for the purpose of render they more systematic and well adapt they to emergency of the war be at this time particularly desirable of the additional ship authorize to be fit for service two will be shortly ready to sail a third be under repair and delay will be avoid in the repair of the residue of the appropriation for the purchase of material for ship building the great part have be apply to that object and the purchase will be continue with the balance the enterprising spirit which have characterize our naval force and its success both in restrain insult and depredation on our coast and in reprisal on the enemy will not fail to recommend an enlargement of it there be reason to believe that the act prohibit the acceptance of british license be not a sufficient guard against the use of they for purpose favorable to the interest and view of the enemy further provision on that subject be highly important nor be it less so that penal enactment should be provide for case of corrupt and perfidious intercourse with the enemy not amount to treason nor yet embrace by any statutory provision a considerable number of american vessel which be in england when the revocation of the order in council take place be laden with british manufacture under an erroneous impression that the non importation act would immediately cease to operate and have arrive in the united states it do not appear proper to exercise on unforeseen case of such magnitude the power vest in the treasury department to mitigate forfeiture without previously affording to congress an opportunity of make on the subject such provision as they may think proper in their decision they will doubtless equally consult what be due to equitable consideration and to the public interest the receipt into the treasury during the year end on the 30th of september last have exceed $ 16.5 m which have be sufficient to defray all the demand on the treasury to that day include a necessary reimbursement of near $ 3 m of the principal of the public debt in these receipt be include a sum of near $ 5.85 m receive on account of the loan authorize by the act of the last session the whole sum actually obtain on loan amount to $ 11 m the residue of which be receivable subsequent to the 30th of september last will together with the current revenue enable we to defray all the expense of this year the duty on the late unexpected importation of british manufacture will render the revenue of the ensue year more productive than could have be anticipate the situation of our country fellow citizen be not without its difficulty though it abound in animate consideration of which the view here present of our pecuniary resource be an example with more than one nation we have serious and unsettled controversy and with one powerful in the mean and habit of war we be at war the spirit and strength of the nation be nevertheless equal to the support of all its right and to carry it through all its trial they can be meet in that confidence above all we have the inestimable consolation of know that the war in which we be actually engage be a war neither of ambition nor of vain glory that it be wage not in violation of the right of other but in the maintenance of our own that it be precede by a patience without example under wrong accumulate without end and that it be finally not declare until every hope of avert it be extinguish by the transfer of the british scepter into new hand cling to former council and until declaration be reiterate to the last hour through the british envoy here that the hostile edict against our commercial right and our maritime independence would not be revoke nay that they could not be revoke without violate the obligation of great britain to other power as well as to her own interest to have shrink under such circumstance from manly resistance would have be a degradation blast our good and proud hope it would have strike we from the high rank where the virtuous struggle of our father have place we and have betray the magnificent legacy which we hold in trust for future generation it would have acknowledge that on the element which form three fourth of the globe we inhabit and where all independent nation have equal and common right the american people be not an independent people but colonist and vassal it be at this moment and with such an alternative that war be choose the nation feel the necessity of it and call for it the appeal be accordingly make in a just cause to the just and all powerful being who hold in his hand the chain of event and the destiny of nation it remain only that faithful to ourselves entangle in no connection with the view of other power and ever ready to accept peace from the hand of justice we prosecute the war with united counsel and with the ample faculty of the nation until peace be so obtain and as the only mean under the divine blessing of speedily obtain it
  about to add the solemnity of an oath to the obligation impose by a second call to the station in which my country heretofore place i i find in the presence of this respectable assembly an opportunity of publicly repeat my profound sense of so distinguish a confidence and of the responsibility unite with it the impression on i be strengthen by such an evidence that my faithful endeavor to discharge my arduous duty have be favorably estimate and by a consideration of the momentous period at which the trust have be renew from the weight and magnitude now belong to it i should be compel to shrink if i have less reliance on the support of an enlightened and generous people and feel less deeply a conviction that the war with a powerful nation which form so prominent a feature in our situation be stamp with that justice which invite the smile of heaven on the mean of conduct it to a successful termination may we not cherish this sentiment without presumption when we reflect on the character by which this war be distinguish it be not declare on the part of the united states until it have be long make on they in reality though not in name until argument and postulation have be exhaust until a positive declaration have be receive that the wrong provoke it would not be discontinue nor until this last appeal could no long be delay without break down the spirit of the nation destroy all confidence in itself and in its political institution and either perpetuate a state of disgraceful suffering or regain by more costly sacrifice and more severe struggle our lose rank and respect among independent power on the issue of the war be stake our national sovereignty on the high sea and the security of an important class of citizen whose occupation give the proper value to those of every other class not to contend for such a stake be to surrender our equality with other power on the element common to all and to violate the sacred title which every member of the society have to its protection i need not call into view the unlawfulness of the practice by which our mariner be force at the will of every cruise officer from their own vessel into foreign one nor paint the outrage inseparable from it the proof be in the record of each successive administration of our government and the cruel suffering of that portion of the american people have find their way to every bosom not dead to the sympathy of human nature as the war be just in its origin and necessary and noble in its object we can reflect with a proud satisfaction that in carry it on no principle of justice or honor no usage of civilized nation no precept of courtesy or humanity have be infringe the war have be wage on our part with scrupulous regard to all these obligation and in a spirit of liberality which be never surpass how little have be the effect of this example on the conduct of the enemy they have retain as prisoner of war citizen of the united states not liable to be so consider under the usage of war they have refuse to consider as prisoner of war and threaten to punish as traitor and deserter person emigrate without restraint to the united states incorporate by naturalization into our political family and fight under the authority of their adopt country in open and honorable war for the maintenance of its right and safety such be the avow purpose of a government which be in the practice of naturalize by thousand citizen of other country and not only of permit but compel they to fight its battle against their native country they have not it be true take into their own hand the hatchet and the knife devote to indiscriminate massacre but they have let loose the savage arm with these cruel instrument have allure they into their service and carry they to battle by their side eager to glut their savage thirst with the blood of the vanquished and to finish the work of torture and death on maim and defenseless captive and what be never before see british commander have extort victory over the unconquerable valor of our troop by present to the sympathy of their chief captive await massacre from their savage associate and now we find they in further contempt of the mode of honorable warfare supply the place of a conquering force by attempt to disorganize our political society to dismember our confederate republic happily like other these will recoil on the author but they mark the degenerate counsel from which they emanate and if they do not belong to a sense of unexampled inconsistency might excite the great wonder as proceed from a government which found the very war in which it have be so long engage on a charge against the disorganizing and insurrectional policy of its adversary to render the justice of the war on our part the more conspicuous the reluctance to commence it be follow by the early and strong manifestation of a disposition to arrest its progress the sword be scarcely out of the scabbard before the enemy be apprise of the reasonable term on which it would be resheathe still more precise advance be repeat and have be receive in a spirit forbid every reliance not place on the military resource of the nation these resource be amply sufficient to bring the war to an honorable issue our nation be in number more than half that of the british isles it be compose of a brave a free a virtuous and an intelligent people our country abound in the necessary the art and the comfort of life a general prosperity be visible in the public countenance the mean employ by the british cabinet to undermine it have recoil on themselves have give to our national faculty a more rapid development and drain or divert the precious metal from british circulation and british vault have pour they into those of the united states it be a propitious consideration that an unavoidable war should have find this seasonable facility for the contribution require to support it when the public voice call for war all know and still know that without they it could not be carry on through the period which it might last and the patriotism the good sense and the manly spirit of our fellow citizen be pledge for the cheerfulness with which they will bear each his share of the common burden to render the war short and its success sure animate and systematic exertion alone be necessary and the success of our arm now may long preserve our country from the necessity of another resort to they already have the gallant exploit of our naval hero prove to the world our inherent capacity to maintain our right on one element if the reputation of our arm have be throw under cloud on the other presage flash of heroic enterprise assure we that nothing be want to correspondent triumph there also but the discipline and habit which be in daily progress
fellow citizen of the senate and of the house of representatives at an early day after the close of the last session of congress an offer be formally communicate from his imperial majesty the emperor of russia of his mediation as the common friend of the united states and great britain for the purpose of facilitate a peace between they the high character of the emperor alexander be a satisfactory pledge for the sincerity and impartiality of his offer it be immediately accept and as a further proof of the disposition on the part of the united states to meet their adversary in honorable experiment for terminate the war it be determined to avoid intermediate delay incident to the distance of the party by a definitive provision for the contemplated negotiation three of our eminent citizen be accordingly commission with the requisite power to conclude a treaty of peace with person clothe with like power on the part of great britain they be authorize also to enter into such conventional regulation of the commerce between the two country as may be mutually advantageous the two envoy who where in the united states at the time of their appointment have proceed to join their colleague already at st. petersburg the envoy have receive another commission authorize they to conclude with russia a treaty of commerce with a view to strengthen the amicable relation and improve the beneficial intercourse between the two country the issue of this friendly interposition of the russian emperor and this pacific manifestation on the part of the united states time only can decide that the sentiment of great britain toward that sovereign will have produce an acceptance of his offer mediation must be presume that no adequate motive exist to prefer a continuance of war with the united states to the term on which they be willing to close it be certain the british cabinet also must be sensible that with respect to the important question of impressment on which the war so essentially turn a search for or seizure of british person or property on board neutral vessel on the high sea be not a belligerent right derive from the law of nation and it be obvious that no visit or search or use of force for any purpose on board the vessel of one independent power on the high sea can in war or peace be sanction by the law or authority of another power it be equally obvious that for the purpose of preserve to each state its seafaring member by exclude they from the vessel of the other the mode heretofore propose by the united states and now enact by they as an article of municipal policy can not for a moment be compare with the mode practice by great britain without a conviction of its title to preference inasmuch as the latter leave the discrimination between the mariner of the two nation to officer expose by unavoidable bias as well as by a defect of evidence to a wrong decision under circumstance preclude for the most part the enforcement of control penalty and where a wrong decision besides the irreparable violation of the sacred right of person might frustrate the plan and profit of entire voyage whereas the mode assume by the united states guard with study fairness and efficacy against error in such case and avoid the effect of casual error on the safety of navigation and the success of mercantile expedition if the reasonableness of expectation draw from these consideration could guarantee their fulfillment a just peace would not be distant but it become the wisdom of the national legislature to keep in mind the true policy or rather the indispensable obligation of adapt its measure to the supposition that the only course to that happy event be in the vigorous employment of the resource of war and painful as the reflection be this duty be particularly enforce by the spirit and manner in which the war continue to be wage by the enemy who uninfluence by the unvaried example of humanity set they be add to the savage fury of it on one frontier a system of plunder and conflagration on the other equally forbid by respect for national character and by the establish rule of civilized warfare as an encouragement to persevere and invigorated exertion to bring the contest to a happy result i have the satisfaction of be able to appeal to the auspicious progress of our arm both by land and on the water in continuation of the brilliant achievement of our infant navy a signal triumph have be gain by captain lawrence and his companion in the hornet sloop of war which destroy a british sloop of war with a celerity so unexampled and with a slaughter of the enemy so disproportionate to the loss in the hornet as to claim for the conqueror the high praise and the full recompense provide by congress in precede case our public ship of war in general as well as the private armed vessel have continue also their activity and success against the commerce of the enemy and by their vigilance and address have greatly frustrate the effort of the hostile squadron distribute along our coast to intercept they in return into port and resume their cruise the augmentation of our naval force as authorize at the last session of congress be in progress on the lakes our superiority be near at hand where it be not already establish the event of the campaign so far as they be know to we furnish matter of congratulation and show that under a wise organization and efficient direction the army be destine to a glory not less brilliant than that which already encircle the navy the attack and capture of york be in that quarter a presage of future and great victory while on the western frontier the issue of the late siege of fort meigs leave we nothing to regret but a single act of inconsiderate valor the provision last make for fill the rank and enlarge the staff of the army have have the good effect it will be for the consideration of congress whether other provision depend on their authority may not still far improve the military establishment and the mean of defense the sudden death of the distinguished citizen who represent the united states in france without any special arrangement by he for such a contingency have leave we without the expect sequel to his last communication nor have the french government take any measure for bring the depend negotiation to a conclusion through its representative in the united states this failure add to delay before so unreasonably spin out a successor to our deceased minister have be appoint and be ready to proceed on his mission the course which he will pursue in fulfil it be that prescribe by a steady regard to the true interest of the united states which equally avoid an abandonment of their just demand and a connection of their fortune with the system of other power the receipt in the treasury from the 1st of october to the 31st day of march last include the sum receive on account of treasury note and of the loan authorize by the act of the last and the precede session of congress have amount to $ 15,412,000 the expenditure during the same period amount to $ 15,920,000 and leave in the treasury on the 1st of april the sum of $ 1,857,000 the loan of $ 16,000,000 authorize by the act of the 8th of february last have be contract for of that sum more than $ 1,000,000 have be pay into the treasury prior to the 1st of

yet be bring into effect this view of our finance whilst it show that due provision have be make for the expense of the current year show at the same time by the limited amount of the actual revenue and the dependence on loan the necessity of provide more adequately for the future supply of the treasury this can be well do by a well digest system of internal revenue in aid of exist source which will have the effect both of abridge the amount of necessary loan and on that account as well as by place the public credit on a more satisfactory basis of improve the term on which loan may be obtain the loan of sixteen million be not contract for at a less interest than about 7 1/2 per cent and although other cause may have have an agency it can not be doubt that with the advantage of a more extended and less precarious revenue a low rate of interest might have suffice a long postponement of this advantage could not fail to have a still great influence on future loan in recommend to the national legislature this resort to additional taxis i feel great satisfaction in the assurance that our constituent who have already display so much zeal and firmness in the cause of their country will cheerfully give any other proof of their patriotism which it call for happily no people with local and transitory exception never to be wholly avoid be more able than the people of the united states to spare for the public want a portion of their private mean whether regard be have to the ordinary profit of industry or the ordinary price of subsistence in our country compare with those in any other and in no case could strong reason be feel for yield the requisite contribution by render the public resource certain and commensurate to the public exigency the constituted authority will be able to prosecute the war the more rapidly to its proper issue every hostile hope found on a calculate failure of our resource will be cut off and by add to the evidence of bravery and skill in combat on the ocean and the land and alacrity in supply the treasure necessary to give they their full effect and demonstrate to the world the public energy which our political institution combine with the personal liberty distinguish they the good security will be provide against future enterprise on the right or the peace of the nation the contest in which the united states be engage appeal

fellow citizens of the senate and of the house of representatives in meet you at the present interesting conjuncture it would have be highly satisfactory if i could have communicate a favorable result to the mission charge with negotiation for restore peace it be a just expectation from the respect due to the distinguished sovereign who have invite they by his offer of mediation from the readiness with which the invitation be accept on the part of the united states and from the pledge to be find in an act of their legislature for the liberality which their plenipotentiary would carry into the negotiation that no time would be lose by the british government in embrace the experiment for hasten a stop to the effusion of blood a prompt and cordial acceptance of the mediation on that side be the less to be doubt as it be of a nature not to submit right or pretension on either side to the decision of an umpire but to afford merely an opportunity honorable and desirable to both for discuss and if possible adjust they for the interest of both the british cabinet either mistake our desire of peace for a dread of british power or mislead by other fallacious calculation have disappoint this reasonable anticipation no communication from our envoy having reach we no information on the subject have be receive from that source but it be know that the mediation be decline in the 1st instance and there be no evidence notwithstanding the lapse of time that a change of disposition in the british council have take place or be to be expect under such circumstance a nation proud of its right and conscious of its strength have no choice but an exertion of the 1 in support of the other to this determination the good encouragement be derive from the success with which it have please the almighty to bless our arm both on the land and on the water whilst proof have be continue of the enterprise and skill of our cruiser public and private on the ocean and a trophy gain in the capture of a british by an american vessel of war after an action give celebrity to the name of the victorious commander the great inland water on which the enemy be also to be encounter have present achievement of our naval arm as brilliant in their character as they have be important in their consequence on lake erie the squadron under command of captain perry having meet the british squadron of superior force a sanguinary conflict end in the capture of the whole the conduct of that officer adroit as it be dare and which be so well second by his comrade justly entitle they to the admiration and gratitude of their country and will fill an early page in its naval annal with a victory never surpass in luster however much it may have be in magnitude on lake ontario the caution of the british commander favor by contingency frustrate the effort of the american commander to bring on a decisive action captain chauncey be able however to establish an ascendancy on that important theater and to prove by the manner in which he effect everything possible that opportunity only be want for a more shining display of his own talent and the gallantry of those under his command the success on lake erie having open a passage to the territory of the enemy the officer command the northwestern army transfer the war thither and rapidly pursue the hostile troop flee with their savage associate force a general action which quickly terminate in the capture of the british and dispersion of the savage force this result be signally honorable to major general harrison by whose military talent it be prepare to colonel johnson and his mounted volunteer whose impetuous onset give a decisive blow to the rank of the enemy and to the spirit of the volunteer militia equally brave and patriotic who bear an interesting part in the scene more especially to the chief magistrate of kentucky at the head of they whose heroism signalize in the war which establish the independence of his country seek at an advanced age a share in hardship and battle for maintain its right and its safely the effect of these success have be to rescue the inhabitant of mi from their oppression aggravate by gross infraction of the capitulation which subject they to a foreign power to alienate the savage of numerous tribe from the enemy by whom they be disappoint and abandon and to relieve an extensive region of country from a merciless warfare which desolate its frontier and impose on its citizen the most harassing service in consequence of our naval superiority on lake ontario and the opportunity afford by it for concentrate our force by water operation which have be provisionally plan be set on foot against the possession of the enemy on the st. lawrence such however be the delay produce in the 1st instance by adverse weather of unusual violence and continuance and such the circumstance attend the final movement of the army that the prospect at one time so favorable be not realize the cruelty of the enemy in enlist the savage into a war with a nation desirous of mutual emulation in mitigate its calamity have not be confine to any one quarter wherever they could be turn against we no exertion to effect it have be spare on our southwestern border the creek tribe who yield to our persevere endeavor be gradually acquire more civilized habit become the unfortunate victim of seduction a war in that quarter have be the consequence infuriate by a bloody fanaticism recently propagate among they it be necessary to crush such a war before it could spread among the contiguous tribe and before it could favor enterprise of the enemy into that vicinity with this view a force be call into the service of the united states from the states of georgia and tennessee which with the near regular troop and other corp from the massachussets territory might not only chastise the savage into present peace but make a lasting impression on their fear the progress of the expedition as far as be yet know correspond with the martial zeal with which it be espouse and the good hope of a satisfactory issue be authorize by the complete success with which a well plan enterprise be execute against a body of hostile savage by a detachment of the volunteer militia of tn under the gallant command of general coffee and by a still more important victory over a large body of they gain under the immediate command of major general jackson an officer equally distinguished for his patriotism and his military talent the systematic perseverance of the enemy in court the aid of the savage in all quarter have the natural effect of kindle their ordinary propensity to war into a passion which even among those well disposed toward the united states be ready if not employ on our side to be turn against we a departure from our protract forbearance to accept the service tender by they have thus be force upon we but in yield to it the retaliation have be mitigate as much as possible both in its extent and in its character stop far short of the example of the enemy who owe the advantage they have occasionally gain in battle chiefly to the of their savage associate and who have not control they either from their usual practice of indiscriminate massacre on defenseless inhabitant or from scene of carnage without a parallel on prisoner to the british arm guard by all the law of humanity and of honorable war for these enormity the enemy be equally responsible whether with the power to prevent they they want the will or with the knowledge of a want of power they still avail themselves of such instrument in other respect the enemy be pursue a course which threaten consequence most afflict to humanity a stand law of great britain naturalize as be well know all alien comply with condition limit to a short period than those require by the united states and naturalize subject be in war employ by her government in common with native subject in a contiguous british province regulation promulgate since the commencement of the war compel citizen of the united states be there under certain circumstance to bear arm whilst of the native emigrant from the united states who compose much of the population of the province a number have actually bear arm against the united states within their limit some of whom after having do so have become prisoner of war and be now in our possession the british commander in that province nevertheless with the sanction as appear of his government think proper to select from american prisoner of war and send to great britain for trial as criminal a of individual who have emigrate from the british dominion long prior to the state of war between the two nation who have incorporate themselves into our political society in the mode recognize by the law and the practice of great britain and who be make prisoner of war under the banner of their adopt country fight for its right and its safety the protection due to these citizen require an effectual interposition in their behalf a like numver of british prisoner of war be put into confinement with a notification that they would experience whatever violence might be commit on the american prisoner of war send to great britain it be hope that this necessary consequence of the step unadvisedly take on the part of great britain would have lead her government to reflect on the inconsistency of its conduct and that a sympathy with the british if not with the american sufferer would have arrest the cruel career open by its example this be unhappily not the case in violation both of consistency and of humanity american officer and non commission officer in double the number of the british soldier confine here be order into close confinement with formal notice that in the event of a retaliation for the death which might be inflict on the prisoner of war send to great britain for trial the officer so confined would be put to death also it be notify at the same time that the commander of the british fleet and army on our coast be instruct in the same event to proceed with a destructive severity against our town and their inhabitant that no doubt might be leave with the enemy of our adherence to the retaliatory resort impose on we a correspondent number of british officer prisoner of war in our hand be immediately put into close confinement to abide the fate of those confine by the enemy and the british government be apprise of the determination of this government to retaliate any other proceeding against we contrary to the legitimate mode of warfare it be fortunate for the united states that they have it in their power to meet the enemy in this deplorable contest as it be honorable to they that they do not join in it but under the most imperious obligation and with the humane purpose of effectuate a return to the established usage of war the view of the french government on the subject which have be so long commit to negotiation have receive no elucidation since the close of your late session the minister plenipotentiary of the united states at paris have not be enable by proper opportunity to press the object of his mission as prescribe by his instruction the militia be always to be regard as the great bulwark of defense and security for free state and the constitution having wisely commit to the national authority a use of that force as the good provision against an unsafe military establishment as well as a resource peculiarly adapt to a country have the extent and the exposure of the united states i recommend to congress a revision of the militia law for the purpose of secure more effectually the service of all detachment call into the employment and place under the government of the united states it will deserve the consideration of congress also whether among other improvement in the militia law justice do not require a regulation under due precaution for defray the expense incident to the 1st assembling as well as the subsequent movement of detachment call into the national service to give to our vessel of war public and private the requisite advantage in their cruise it be of much importance that they should have both for themselves and their prize the use of the port and market of friendly power with this view i recommend to congress the expediency of such legal provision as may supply the defect or remove the doubt of the executive authority to allow to the cruiser of other power at war with enemy of the united states such use of the american port as may correspond with the privilege allow by such power to american cruiser during the year end on the 30 of september last the receipt into the treasury have exceed $ 37.5 m of which near $ 24 m be the produce of loan after meet all demand for the public service there remain in the treasury on that day near $ 7m. under the authority contain in the act of the 2nd of august last for borrow $ 7.5 m that sum have be obtain on term more favorable to the united states than those of the precede loan make during the present year far sum to a considerable amount will be necessary to be obtain in the same way during the ensue year and from the increase capital of the country from the fidelity with which the public engagement have be keep and the public credit maintain it may be expect on good ground that the necessary pecuniary supply will not be want the expense of the current year from the multiplied operation fall within it have necessarily be extensive but on a just estimate of the campaign in which the mass of they have be incur the cost will not be find disproportionate to the advantage which have be gain the campaign have indeed in its latter stage in one quarter be less favorable than be expect but in addition to the importance of our naval success the progress of the campaign have be fill with incident highly honorable to the american arm the attack of the enemy on craney island on fort meigs on sacketts harbor and on sandusky have be vigorously and successfully repulse nor have they in any case succeed on either frontier except when direct against the peaceable dwelling of individual or village unprepared or undefended on the other hand the movement of the american army have be follow by the reduction of york and of forts george erie and malden by the recovery of detroit and the extinction of the indian war in the west and by the occupancy or command of a large portion of upper canada battle have also be fight on the border of the st. lawrence which though not accomplish their entire object reflect honor on the discipline and prowess of our soldiery the good augury of eventual victory in the same scale be to be place the late success in the south over one of the most powerful which have become one of the most hostile also of the indian tribe it would be improper to close this communication without express a thankfulness in which all ought to unite for the abundance for the preservation of our internal tranquillity and the stability of our free institution and above all for the light of divine truth and the protection of every man 's conscience in the enjoyment of it and although among our blessing we can not number an exemption from the evil of war yet these will never be regard as the great of evil by the friend of liberty and of the right of nation our country have before prefer they to the degraded condition which be the alternative when the sword be draw in the cause which give birth to our national independence and none who contemplate the magnitude and feel the value of that glorious event will shrink from a struggle to maintain the high and happy ground on which it place the american people with all good citizen the justice and necessity of resist wrong and usurpation no long to be bear will sufficiently outweigh the privation and sacrifice inseparable from a state of war but it be a reflection moreover peculiarly console that whilst war be generally aggravate by their baneful effect on the internal improvement and permanent prosperity of the nation engage in they such be the favored situation of the united states that the calamity of the contest into which they have be compel to enter be mitigate by improvement and advantage of which the contest itself be the source if the war have increase the interruption of our commerce it have at the same time cherish and multiply our manufacture so as to make we independent of all other country for the more essential branch for which we ought to be dependent on none and be even rapidly give they an extent which will create additional staple in our future intercourse with foreign market if much treasure have be expend no inconsiderable portion of it have be apply to object durable in their value and necessary to our permanent safety if the war have expose we to increase spoliation on the ocean and to predatory incursion on the land it have develop the national mean of retaliate the former and of provide protection against the latter demonstrate to all that every blow aim at our maritime independence be an impulse accelerate the growth of our maritime power by diffuse through the mass of the nation the element of military discipline and instruction by augment and distribute warlike preparation applicable to future use by evince the zeal and valor with which they will be employ and the cheerfulness with which every necessary burden will be bear a great respect for our right and a long duration of our future peace be promise than could be expect without these proof of the national character and resource the war have prove moreover that our free government like other free government though slow in its early movement acquire in its progress a force proportion to its freedom and that the union of these states the guardian of the freedom and safety of all and of each be strengthen by every occasion that put it to the test in fine the war with all its vicissitude be illustrate the capacity and the destiny of the united states to be a great a flourishing and a powerful nation worthy of the friendship which it be disposed to cultivate with all other and authorize by its own example to require from all an observance of the law of justice and reciprocity beyond these their claim have never extend and in contend for these we behold a subject for our congratulation in the daily testimony of increase harmony throughout the nation and may humbly repose our trust in the smile of heaven on so righteous a cause

that any inadequacy in the exist provision for the want of the treasury might be supply as that no delay might happen in provide for the result of the negotiation on foot with great britain whether it should require arrangement adapt to a return of peace or further and more effective provision for prosecute the war that result be not yet know if on the one hand the repeal of the order in council and the general pacification in europe which withdraw the occasion on which impressment from american vessel be practice suggest expectation that peace and amity may be reestablish we be compel on the other hand by the refusal of the british government to accept the offer mediation of the emperor of russia by the delay in give effect to its own proposal of a direct negotiation and above all by the principle and manner in which the war be now avowedly carry on to infer that a spirit of hostility be indulge more violent than ever against the right and prosperity of this country this increase violence be well explain by the two important circumstance that the great contest in europe for an equilibrium guarantee all its states against the ambition of any have be close without any check on the over bear power of great britain on the ocean and it have leave in her hand disposable armament with which forget the difficulty of a remote war with a free people and yield to the intoxication of success with the example of a great victim to it before her eye she cherish hope of still far aggrandize a power already formidable in its abuse to the tranquillity of the civilized and commercial world but whatever may have inspire the enemy with these more violent purpose the public council of a nation more able to maintain than it be to require its independence and with a devotion to it render more ardently by the experience of its blessing can never deliberate but on the mean most effectual for defeat the extravagant view or unwarrantable passion with which alone the war can now be pursue against we in the event of the present campaign the enemy with all his augmented means and wanton use of they have little ground for exultation unless he can feel it in the success of his recent enterprise against this metropolis and the neighboring town of alexandria from both of which his retreat be as precipitate as his attempt be bold and fortunate in his other incursion on our atlantic frontier his progress often check and chastise by the martial spirit of the neighboring citizen have have more effect in distress individual and in dishonor his arm than in promote any object of legitimate warfare and in the two instance mention however deeply to be regret on our part he will find in his transient success which interrupt for a moment only the ordinary business at the seat of government no compensation for the loss of character with the world by his violation of private property and by his destruction of public edifice protect as monument of the art by the law of civilized warfare on our side we can appeal to a series of achievement which have give new luster to the american arm besides the brilliant incident in the minor operation of the campaign the splendid victory gain on the canadian side of the niagara by the american force under major general brown and brigadiers scott and gaines have gain for these hero and their emulating companion the most unfading laurel and having triumphantly test the progressive discipline of the american soldiery have teach the enemy that the long he protract his hostile effort the more certain and decisive will be his final discomfiture on our southern border victory have continue also to follow the american standard the bold and skillful operation of major general jackson conduct troop draw from the militia of the states least distant particularly tennessee have subdue the principal tribe of hostile savage and by establish a peace with they precede by recent and exemplary chastisement have well guard against the mischief of their cooperation with the british enterprise which may be plan against that quarter of our country important tribe of indians on our northwestern frontier have also accede to stipulation which bind they to the interest of the united states and to consider our enemy as theirs also in the recent attempt of the enemy on the city of baltimore defend by militia and volunteer aid by a small body of regular and sea man he be receive with a spirit which produce a rapid retreat to his ship whilst concurrent attack by a large fleet be successfully resist by the steady and well direct fire of the fort and battery oppose to it in another recent attack by a powerful force on our troop at plattsburg of which regular make a part only the enemy after a perseverance for many hour be finally compel to seek safety in a hasty retreat with our gallant band press upon they on the lakes so much contest throughout the war the great exertion for the command make on our part have be well repay on lake ontario our squadron be now and have be for some time in a condition to confine that of the enemy to his own port and to favor the operation of our land force on that frontier a part of the squadron on lake erie have be extend into lake huron and have produce the advantage of display our command on that lake also one object of the expedition be the reduction of mackinaw which file with the loss of a few brave man among whom be an officer justly distinguish for his gallant exploit the expedition ably conduct by both the land and the naval commander be otherwise highly valuable in its effect on lake champlain where our superiority have for some time be undisputed the british squadron lately come into action with the american command by captain macdonough it issue in the capture of the whole of the enemy 's ship the good praise for this officer and his intrepid comrade be in the likeness of his triumph to the illustrious victory which immortalize another officer and establish at a critical moment our command of another lake on the ocean the pride of our naval arm have be amply support a second frigate have indeed fall into the hand of the enemy but the loss be hide in the blaze of heroism with which she be defend captain porter who command she and whose previous career have be distinguish by dare enterprise and by fertility of genius maintain a sanguinary contest against two ship one of they superior to his own and under other severe disadvantage til humanity tear down the color which valor have nail to the mast this officer and his brave comrade have add much to the rise glory of the american flag and have merit all the effusion of gratitude which their country be ever ready to bestow on the champion of its right and of its safety two small vessel of war have also become prize to the enemy but by a superiority of force which sufficiently vindicate the reputation of their commander whilst two other one command by captain warrington the other by captain blakely have capture british ship of the same class with a gallantry and good conduct which entitle they and their companion to a just share in the praise of their country in spite of the naval force of the enemy accumulate on our coast our private cruiser also have not cease to annoy his commerce and to bring their rich prize into our port contribute thus with other proof to demonstrate the incompetency and illegality of a blockade the proclamation of which be make the pretext for vex and discourage the commerce of neutral power with the united states to meet the extended and diversify warfare adopt by the enemy great body of militia have be take into service for the public defense and great expense incur that the defense everywhere may be both more convenient and more economical congress will see the necessity of immediate measure for fill the rank of the regular army and of enlarge the provision for special corps mount and unmounted to be engage for long period of service than be due from the militia i earnestly renew at the same time a recommendation of such change in the system of the militia as by class and discipline for the most prompt and active service the portion most capable of it will give to that great resource for the public safety all the requisite energy and efficiency the money receive into the treasury during the nine month end on the 30th day of june last amount to $ 32 m of which near $ 11 m be the proceed of the public revenue and the remainder derive from loan the disbursement for public expenditure during the same period exceed $ 34 m and leave in the treasury on the first day of july near $ 5m. the demand during the remainder of the present year already authorize by congress and the expense incident to an extension of the operation of the war will render it necessary that large sum should be provide to meet they from this view of the national affair congress will be urge to take up without delay as well the subject of pecuniary supply as that of military force and on a scale commensurate with the extent and the character which the war have assume it be not to be disguise that the situation of our country call for its great effort our enemy be powerful in man and in money on the land and on the water avail himself of fortuitous advantage he be aim with his undivided force a deadly blow at our grow prosperity perhaps at our national existence he have avow his purpose of trample on the usage of civilized warfare and give earnest of it in the plunder and wanton destruction of private property in his pride of maritime dominion and in his thirst of commercial monopoly he strike with peculiar animosity at the progress of our navigation and of our manufacture his barbarous policy have not even spare those monument of the art and model of taste with which our country have enrich and embellish its infant metropolis from such an adversary hostility in its great force and in its bad form may be look for the american people will face it with the undaunted spirit which in their revolutionary struggle defeat his unrighteous project his threat and his barbarity instead of dismay will kindle in every bosom an indignation not be extinguish but in the disaster and expulsion of such cruel invader in provide the mean necessary the national legislature will not distrust the heroic and enlightened patriotism of its constituent they will cheerfully and proudly bear every burden of every kind which the safety and honor of the nation demand we have see they everywhere pay their taxis direct and indirect with the great promptness and alacrity we see they rush with enthusiasm to the scene where danger and duty call in offer their blood they give the sure pledge that no other tribute will be withhold have forborne to declare war until to other aggression have be add the capture of near 1000 american vessel and the impressment of thousand of american sea fare citizen and until a final declaration have be make by the government of great britain that her hostile order against our commerce would not be revoke but on condition as impossible as unjust whilst it be know that these order would not otherwise cease but with a war which have last nearly twenty year and which accord to appearance at that time might last as many more having manifest on every occasion and in every proper mode a sincere desire to arrest the effusion of blood and meet our enemy on the ground of justice and reconciliation our beloved country in still oppose to his persevere hostility all its energy with an undiminished disposition toward peace and friendship on honorable term must carry with it the good wish of the impartial world and the good hope of support from an omnipotent and kind providence
to the senate of the united states having bestow on the bill entitle an act to incorporate the subscriber to the bank of the united states of america that full consideration which be due to the great importance of the subject and dictate by the respect which i feel for the two houses of congress i be constrain by a deep and solemn conviction that the bill ought not to become a law to return it to the senate in which it originate with my objection to the same waive the question of the constitutional authority of the legislature to establish an incorporate bank as be preclude in my judgment by repeat recognition under varied circumstance of the validity of such an institution in act of the legislative executive and judicial branch of the government accompany by indication in different mode of a concurrence of the general will of the nation the propose bank do not appear to be calculate to answer the purpose of revive the public credit of provide a national medium of circulation and of aid the treasury by facilitate the indispensable anticipation of the revenue and by afford to the public more durable loans.1 the capital of the bank be to be compound of specie of public stock and of treasury note convertible into stock with a certain pro portion of each of which every subscriber be to furnish himself the amount of the stock to be subscribe will not it be believe be sufficient to produce in favor of the public credit any considerable or lasting elevation of the market price whilst this may be occasionally depress by the bank itself if it should carry into the market the allow proportion of its capital consist of public stock in order to procure specie which it may find its account in procure with some sacrifice on that part of its capital nor will any adequate advantage arise to the public credit from the subscription of treasury note the actual issue of these note nearly equal at present and will soon exceed the amount to be subscribe to the bank the direct effect of this operation be simply to convert fifteen million of treasury note into fifteen million of 6 per cent stock with the collateral effect of promote an additional demand for treasury note beyond what might otherwise be negotiable public credit might indeed be expect to derive advantage from the establishment of a national bank without regard to the formation of its capital if the full aid and cooperation of the institution be secure to the government during the war and during the period of its fiscal embarrassment but the bank propose will be free from all legal obligation to cooperate with the public measure and whatever might be the patriotic disposition of its director to contribute to the removal of those embarrassment and to invigorate the prosecution of the war fidelity to the pecuniary and general interest of the institution accord to their estimate of it might oblige they to decline a connection of their operation with those of the national treasury during the continuance of the war and the difficulty incident to it temporary sacrifice of interest though overbalance by the future and permanent profit of the charter not be requirable of right in behalf of the public might not be gratuitously make and the bank would reap the full benefit of the grant whilst the public would lose the equivalent expect from it for it must be keep in view that the sole inducement to such a grant on the part of the public would be the prospect of substantial aid to its pecuniary mean at the present crisis and during the sequel of the war it be evident that the stock of the bank will on the return of peace if not soon rise in the market to a value which if the bank be establish in a period of peace would authorize and obtain for the public a bonus to a very large amount in lieu of such a bonus the government be fairly entitle to and ought not to relinquish or risk the needful service of the bank under the press circumstance of war.2 the bank as propose to be constitute can not be rely on during the war to provide a circulate medium nor to furnish loan or antici pation of the public revenue without a medium the taxis can not be collect and in the absence of specie the medium understand to be the good substitute be that of note issue by a national bank the propose bank will commence and conduct its operation under an obligation to pay its note in specie or be subject to the loss of its charter without such an obligation the note of the bank though not exchangeable for specie yet rest on good pledge and perform the use of specie in the payment of taxis and in other public transaction would as experience have ascertain qualify the bank to supply at once a circulate medium and pecuniary aid to the government under the fetter impose by the bill it be manifest that during the actual state of thing and probably during the war the period particularly require such a medium and such a resource for loan and advance to the government note for which the bank would be compellable to give specie in exchange could not be keep in circulation the most the bank could effect and the most it could be expect to aim at would be to keep the institution alive by limited and local transaction which with the interest on the public stock in the bank might yield a dividend sufficient for the purpose until a change from war to peace should enable it by a flow of specie into its vault and a removal of the external demand for it to derive its contemplated emolument from a safe and full extension of its operation on the whole when it be consider that the propose establishment will enjoy a monopoly of the profit of a national bank for a period of twenty year that the monopolized profit will be continually grow with the progress of the national population and wealth that the nation will during the same period be dependent on the note of the bank for that specie of circulate medium whenever the precious metal may be want and at all time for so much thereof as may be an eligible substitute for a specie medium and that the extensive employment of the note in the collection of the augmented taxis will moreover enable the bank greatly to extend its profitable issue of they without the expense of specie capital to support their circulation it be as reasonable as it be requisite that the government in return for these extraordinary concession to the bank should have a great security for attain the public object of the institution than be present in the bill and particularly for every practicable accommodation both in the temporary advance necessary to anticipate the taxis and in those more durable loan which be equally necessary to diminish the resort to taxis in discharge this painful duty of state objection to a measure which have undergo the deliberation and receive the sanction of the two houses of the national legislature i console myself with the reflection that if they have not the weight which i attach to they they can be constitutionally overrule and with a confidence that in a contrary event the wisdom of congress will hasten to substitute a more commensurate and certain provision for the public exigency james madison

fellow citizen of the senate and of the house of representatives i have the satisfaction on our present meeting of be able to communicate to you the successful termination of the war which have be commence against the united states by the regency of algiers the squadron in advance on that service under commodore decatur lose not a moment after its arrival in the mediterranean in seek the naval force of the enemy then cruise in that sea and succeed in capture two of his ship one of they the principal ship command by the algerine admiral the high character of the american commander be brilliantly sustain on that occasion which bring his own ship into close action with that of his adversary as be the accustomed gallantry of all the officer and man actually engage having prepare the way by this demonstration of american skill and prowess he hasten to the port of algiers where peace be promptly yield to his victorious force in the term stipulate the right and honor of the united states be particularly consult by a perpetual relinquishment on the part of the dey of all pretension to tribute from they the impression which have thus be make strengthen as they will have be by subsequent transaction with the regencies of tunis and of tripoli by the appearance of the large force which follow under commodore bainbridge the chief in command of the expedition and by the judicious precautionary arrangement leave by he in that quarter afford a reasonable prospect of future security for the valuable portion of our commerce which pass within reach of the barbary cruiser it be another source of satisfaction that the treaty of peace with great britain have be succeed by a convention on the subject of commerce conclude by the plenipotentiary of the two country in this result a disposition be manifest on the part of that nation correspond with the disposition of the united states which it may be hope will be improve into liberal arrangement on other subject on which the party have mutual interest or which might endanger their future harmony congress will decide on the expediency of promote such a sequel by give effect to the measure of confine the american navigation to american seaman a measure which at the same time that it might have that conciliatory tendency would have the further advantage of increase the independence of our navigation and the resource for our maritime defence in conformity with the article in the treaty of ghent relate to the indians as well as with a view to the tranquillity of our western and northwestern frontier measure be take to establish an immediate peace with the several tribe who have be engage in hostility against the united states such of they as be invite to detroit accede readily to a renewal of the former treaty of friendship of the other tribe who be invite to a station on the mississippi the great number have also accept the peace offer to they the residue consist of the more distant tribe or part of tribe remain to be bring over by further explanation or by such other mean as may be adapt to the disposition they may finally disclose the indian tribe within and border on the southern frontier whom a cruel war on their part have compel we to chastise into peace have latterly show a restlessness which have call for preparatory measure for repress it and for protect the commissioner engage in carry the term of the peace into execution the execution of the act fix the military peace establishment have be attend with difficulty which even now can only be overcome by legislative aid the selection of officer the payment and discharge of the troop enlist for the war the payment of the retain troop and their reunion from detached and distant station the collection and security of the public property in the quartermaster commissary and ordnance department and the constant medical assistance require in hospital and garrison render a complete execution of the act impracticable on the ist of may the period more immediately contemplate as soon however as circumstance would permit and as far as it have be practicable consistently with the public interest the reduction of the army have be accomplish but the appropriation for its pay and for other branch of the military service having prove inadequate the early attention to that subject will be necessary and the expediency of continue upon the peace establishment the staff officer who have hitherto be provisionally retain be also recommend to the consideration of congress in the performance of the executive duty upon this occasion there have not be want a just sensibility to the merit of the american army during the late war but the obvious policy and design in fix an efficient military peace establishment do not afford an opportunity to distinguish the aged and infirm on account of their past service nor the wounded and disabled on account of their present suffering the extent of the reduction indeed unavoidably involve the exclusion of many meritorious officer of every rank from the service of their country and so equal as well as so numerous be the claim to attention that a decision by the standard of comparative merit could seldom be attain judged how ever in candor by a general standard of positive merit the army register will it be believe do honor to the establish ment while the case of those officer whose name be not in eluded in it devolve with the strong interest upon the legislative authority for such provision as shall be deem the well calculate to give support and solace to the veteran and the invalid to display the beneficence as well as the justice of the government and to inspire a martial zeal for the public service upon every future emergency although the embarrassment arise from the want of an uniform national currency have not be diminish since the adjournment of congress great satisfaction have be denve in contemplate the revival of the public credit and the effi ciency of the public resource the receipt into the treasury from the vanous branch of revenue during the nine month end on the 30th of september last have be estimate at $ 12,500,000 the issue of treasury note of every denomination during the same period amount to the sum of $ 14,000,000 and there be also obtain upon loan during the same period a sum of $ 9,000,000 of which the sum of $ 6,000,000 be subscribe in cash and the sum of $ 3,000,000 in treasury note with these mean add to the sum of $ 1,500,000 be the balance of money in the treasury on the ist day of january there have be pay be tween the ist of january and the ist of october on account of the appropriation of the precede and of the present year exclusively of the amount of the treasury note subscribe to the loan and of the amount redeem in the payment of du tie and taxis the aggregate sum of $ 33,500,000 leave a balance then in the treasury estimate at the sum of $ 3,000,000 independent however of the arrearage due for military service and supply it be presume that a further sum of $ 5,000,000 include the interest on the public debt payable on the ist of january next will be demand at the treasury to compete the expenditure of the present year and for which the exist way and mean will sufficiently provide the national debt as it be ascertain on the ist of octo ber last amount in the whole to the sum of $ 120,000,000 consist of the unredeemed balance of the debt contract before the late war $ 39,000,000 the amount of the fund debt contract in consequence of the war $ 64,000,000 and the amount of the unfunded and float debt include the vanous issue of treasury note $ 17,000,000 which be in a gradual course of payment there will probably be some ad dition to the public debt upon the liquidation of various claim which be depend and a conciliatory disposition on the part of congress may lead honorably and advantageously to an equitable arrangement of the militia expense incur by the several states without the previous sanction or authority of the government of the united states but when it be consider that the new as well as the old portion of the debt have be contract in the assertion of the national right and independence and when it be recollect that the public expenditure not be exclusively bestow upon subject of a transient nature will long be visible in the number and equip ment of the american navy in the military work for the de fense of our harbor and our frontier and in the supply of our arsenal and magazine the amount will bear a gratifying comparison with the object which have be attain as well as with the resource of the country the arrangement of the finance with a view to the receipt and expenditure of a permanent peace establishment will necessarily enter into the deliberation of congress during the present session it be true that the improved condition of the public revenue will not only afford the mean of maintain the faith of the government with its creditor inviolate and of prosecute successfully the measure of the most liberal policy but will also justify an immediate alleviation of the burden impose by the necessity of the war it be however essential to every modification of the finance that the benefit of an uniform national currency should be restore to the community the absence of the precious metal will it be believe be a temporary evil but until they can again be render the general medium of exchange it devolve on the wisdom of congress to provide a substitute which shall equally engage the confidence and accommodate the want of the citizen throughout the union if the operation of the state bank can not produce this result the probable operation of a national bank will merit consideration and if neither of these expedient be deem effectual it may become necessary to ascertain the term upon which the note of the government no long require as an instrument of credit shall be issue upon motive of general policy as a common medium of circulation notwithstanding the security for future repose which the united states ought to find in their love of peace and their constant respect for the right of other nation the character of the time particularly inculcate the lesson that whether to prevent or repel danger we ought not to be unprepared for it this consideration will sufficiently recommend to congress a liberal provision for the immediate extension and gradual completion of the work of defense both fix and float on our maritime frontier and an adequate provision for guard our inland frontier against danger to which certain portion of it may continue to be expose as an improvement in our military establishment it will deserve the consideration of congress whether a corps of invalid might not be so organized and employ as at once to aid in the support of meritorious individual exclude by age or infirmity from the exist establishment and to procure to the public the benefit of their stationary service and of their exemplary discipline i recommend also an enlargement of the military academy already establish and the establishment of other in other section of the union and i can not press too much on the attention of congress such a classification and organization of the militia as will most effectually render it the safeguard of a free state if experience have shew in the recent splendid achievement of militia the value of this resource for the public defense it have shew also the importance of that skill in the use of arm and that familiarity with the essential rule of discipline which can not be expect from the regulation now in force with this subject be intimately connect the necessity of accommodate the law in every respect to the great object of enable the political authority of the union to employ promptly and effectually the physical power of the union in the case designate by the constitution the signal service which have be render by our navy and the capacity it have develop for successful co operation in the national defense will give to that portion of the public force its full value in the eye of congress at an epoch which call for the constant vigilance of all government to preserve the ship now in a sound state to complete those already contemplate to provide amply the imperishable material for prompt augmentation and to improve the exist arrangement into more advantageous establishment for the construction the repair and the security of vessel of war be dictate by the sound policy in adjust the duty on import to the object of revenue the influence of the tariff on manufacture will necessarily present itself for consideration however wise the theory may be which leave to the sagacity and interest of individual the application of their industry and resource there be in this as in other case exception to the general rule besides the condition which the theory itself imply of a reciprocal adoption by other nation experience teach that so many circumstance must concur in introduce and mature manufacturing establishment especially of the more complicated kind that a country may remain long without they although sufficiently advanced and in some respect even peculiarly fit for carry they on with success under circumstance give a powerful impulse to manufacturing industry it have make among we a progress and exhibit an efficiency which justify the belief that with a protection not more than be due to the enterprise citizen whose interest be now at stake it will become at an early day not only safe against occasional competition from abroad but a source of domestic wealth and even of external commerce in select the branch more especially entitle to the public patronage a preference be obviously claim by such as will relieve the united states from a dependence on foreign supply ever subject to casual failure for article necessary for the public defense or connect with the primary want of individual it will be an additional recommendation of particular manufacture where the material for they be extensively draw from our agriculture and consequently impart and insure to that great fund of national prosperity and independence an encouragement which can not fail to be reward among the mean of advance the public interest the occasion be a proper one for recall the attention of congress to the great importance of establish throughout our country the road and canal which can well be execute under the national authority no object within the circle of political economy so richly repay the expense bestow on they there be none the utility of which be more universally ascertain and acknowledge none that do more honor to the government whose wise and enlarge patriotism duly appreciate they nor be there any country which present a field where nature invite more the art of man to complete her own work for his accommodation and benefit these consideration be strengthen moreover by the political effect of these facility for intercommunication in bring and bind more closely together the various part of our extended confederacy whilst the states individually with a laudable enterprise and emulation avail themselves of their local advantage by new road by navigable canal and by improve the stream susceptible of navigation the general government be the more urged to similar undertaking require a national jurisdiction and national mean by the prospect of thus systematically complete so inestimable a work and it be a happy reflection that any defect of constitutional authority which may be encounter can be supply in a mode which the constitution itself have providently point out the present be a favorable season also for bring again into view the establishment of a national seminary of learn within the district of columbia and with mean draw from the property therein subject to the authority of the general government such an institution claim the patronage of congress as a monument of their solicitude for the advancement of knowledge without which the blessing of liberty can not be fully enjoy or long preserve as a model instructive in the formation of other seminary as a nursery of enlightened preceptor and as a central resort of youth and genius from every part of their country diffuse on their return example of those national feeling those liberal sentiment and those congenial manner which contribute cement to our union and strength to the great political fabric of which that be the foundation in close this communication i ought not to repress a sensibility in which you will unite to the happy lot of our country and to the goodness of a superintending providence to which we be indebted for it whilst other portion of mankind be labor under the distress of war or struggle with adversity in other form the united states be in the tranquil enjoyment of prosperous and honorable peace in review the scene through which it have be attain we can rejoice in the proof give that our political institution found in human right and frame for their preservation be equal to the severe trial of war as well as adapt to the ordinary period of repose as fruit of this experience and of the reputation acquire by the american arm on the land and on the water the nation find itself possess of a grow respect abroad and of a just confidence in itself which be among the good pledge for its peaceful career under other aspect of our country the strong feature of its flourishing condition be see in a population rapidly increase on a territory as productive as it be extensive in a general industry and fertile ingenuity which find their ample reward and in an affluent revenue which admit a reduction of the public burden without withdraw the mean of sustain the public credit of gradually discharge the public debt of provide for the necessary defensive and precautionary establishment and of patronizing in every authorize mode undertaking conducive to the aggregate wealth and individual comfort of our citizen it remain for the guardian of the public welfare to persevere in that justice and good will toward other nation which invite a return of these sentiment toward the united states to cherish institution which guarantee their safety and their liberty civil and religious and to combine with a liberal system of foreign commerce an improvement of the national advantage and a protection and extension of the independent resource of our highly favored and happy country in all measure have such object my faithful co operation will be afford
fellow citizens of the senate and of the house of representatives in review the present state of our country our attention can not be withhold from the effect produce by peculiar season which have very generally impair the annual gift of the earth and threaten scarcity in particular district such however be the variety of soil of climate and of product within our extensive limit that the aggregate resource for subsistence be more than sufficient for the aggregate want and as far as an economy of consumption more than usual may be necessary our thankfulness be due to providence for what be far more than a compensation in the remarkable health which have distinguish the present year amidst the advantage which have succeed the peace of europe and that of the united states with great britain in a general invigoration of industry among we and in the extension of our commerce the value of which be more and more disclose itself to commercial nation it be to be regret that a depression be experience by particular branch of our manufacture and by a portion of our navigation as the first proceed in an essential degree from an excess of import merchandise which carry a check in its own tendency the cause in its present extent can not be very long in duration the evil will not however be view by congress without a recollection that manufacturing establishment if suffer to sink too low or languish too long may not revive after the cause shall have cease and that in the vicissitude of human affair situation may recur in which a dependence on foreign source for indispensable supply may be among the most serious embarrassment the depressed state of our navigation be to be ascribe in a material degree to its exclusion from the colonial port of the nation most extensively connect with we in commerce and from the indirect operation of that exclusion previous to the late convention at london between the united states and great britain the relative state of the navigation law of the two country grow out of the treaty of 1794 have give to the british navigation a material advantage over the american in the intercourse between the american port and british port in europe the convention of london equalize the law of the two country relate to those port leave the intercourse between our port and the port of the british colony subject as before to the respective regulation of the party the british government enforce now regulation which prohibit a trade between its colony and the united states in american vessel whilst they permit a trade in british vessel the american navigation lose accordingly and the loss be augment by the advantage which be give to the british competition over the american in the navigation between our port and british port in europe by the circuitous voyage enjoy by the one and not enjoy by the other the reasonableness of the rule of reciprocity apply to one branch of the commercial intercourse have be press on our part as equally applicable to both branch but it be ascertain that the british cabinet decline all negotiation on the subject with a disavowal however of any disposition to view in an unfriendly light whatever countervail regulation the united states may oppose to the regulation of which they complain the wisdom of the legislature will decide on the course which under these circumstance be prescribe by a joint regard to the amicable relation between the two nation and to the just interest of the united states i have the satisfaction to state generally that we remain in amity with foreign power an occurrence have indeed take place in the gulf of mexico which if sanction by the spanish government may make an exception as to that power accord to the report of our naval commander on that station one of our public armed vessel be attack by an over power force under a spanish commander and the american flag with the officer and crew insult in a manner call for prompt reparation this have be demand in the mean time a frigate and a small vessel of war have be order into that gulf for the protection of our commerce it would be improper to omit that the representative of his catholic majesty in the united states lose no time in give the strong assurance that no hostile order could have emanate from his government and that it will be as ready to do as to expect whatever the nature of the case and the friendly relation of the two country shall be find to require the posture of our affair with algiers at the present moment be not know the day draw pretext from circumstance for which the united states be not answerable address a letter to this government declare the treaty last conclude with he to have be annul by our violation of it and present as the alternative war or a renewal of the former treaty which stipulate among other thing an annual tribute the answer with an explicit declaration that the united states preferred war to tribute require his recognition and observance of the treaty last make which abolish tribute and the slavery of our capture citizen the result of the answer have not be receive should he renew his warfare on our commerce we rely on the protection it will find in our naval force actually in the mediterranean with the other barbary states our affair have undergo no change the indian tribe within our limit appear also dispose to remain at peace from several of they purchase of land have be make particularly favorable to the wish and security of our frontier settlement as well as to the general interest of the nation in some instance the title though not support by due proof and clash those of one tribe with the claim of another have be extinguish by double purchase the benevolent policy of the united states prefer the augmented expense to the hazard of do injustice or to the enforcement of justice against a feeble and untutored people by mean involve or threaten an effusion of blood i be happy to ad that the tranquillity which have be restore among the tribe themselves as well as between they and our own population will favor the resumption of the work of civilization which have make an encouraging progress among some tribe and that the facility be increase for extend that divided and individual ownership which exist now in movable property only to the soil itself and of thus establish in the culture and improvement of it the true foundation for a transit from the habit of the savage to the art and comfort of social life as a subject of the high importance to the national welfare i must again earnestly recommend to the consideration of congress a reorganization of the militia on a plan which will form it into class accord to the period of life more or less adapt to military service an efficient militia be authorize and contemplate by the constitution and require by the spirit and safety of free government the present organization of our militia be universally regard as less efficient than it ought to be make and no organization can be well calculate to give to it its due force than a classification which will assign the foremost place in the defense of the country to that portion of its citizen whose activity and animation well enable they to rally to its standard besides the consideration that a time of peace be the time when the change can be make with most convenience and equity it will now be aid by the experience of a recent war in which the militia bear so interesting a part congress will call to mind that no adequate provision have yet be make for the uniformity of weight and measure also contemplate by the constitution the great utility of a standard fix in its nature and found on the easy rule of decimal proportion be sufficiently obvious it lead the government at an early stage to preparatory step for introduce it and a completion of the work will be a just title to the public gratitude the importance which i have attach to the establishment of a university within this district on a scale and for object worthy of the american nation induce i to renew my recommendation of it to the favorable consideration of congress and i particularly invite again their attention to the expediency of exercise their exist power and where necessary of resort to the prescribed mode of enlarge they in order to effectuate a comprehensive system of road and canal such as will have the effect of draw more closely together every part of our country by promote intercourse and improvement and by increase the share of every part in the common stock of national prosperity occurrence having take place which shew that the statutory provision for the dispensation of criminal justice be deficient in relation both to place and to person under the exclusive cognizance of the national authority an amendment of the law embrace such case will merit the early attention of the legislature it will be a seasonable occasion also for inquire how far legislative interposition may be far requisite in provide penalty for offense designate in the constitution or in the statute and to which either no penalty be annexed or none with sufficient certainty and i submit to the wisdom of congress whether a more enlarged revisal of the criminal code be not expedient for the purpose of mitigate in certain case penalty which be adopt into it antecedent to experiment and example which justify and recommend a more lenient policy the united states having be the first to abolish within the extent of their authority the transportation of the native of africa into slavery by prohibit the introduction of slave and by punish their citizen participate in the traffic can not but be gratify at the progress make by concurrent effort of other nation toward a general suppression of so great an evil they must feel at the same time the great solicitude to give the full efficacy to their own regulation with that view the interposition of congress appear to be require by the violation and evasion which it be suggest be chargeable on unworthy citizen who mingle in the slave trade under foreign flag and with foreign port and by collusive importation of slave into the united states through adjoining port and territory i present the subject to congress with a full assurance of their disposition to apply all the remedy which can be afford by an amendment of the law the regulation which be intend to guard against abuse of a kindre character in the trade between the several states ought also to be render more effectual for their humane object to these recommendation i add for the consideration of congress the expediency of a remodification of the judiciary establishment and of an additional department in the executive branch of the government the first be call for by the accruing business which necessarily swell the duty of the federal court and by the great and widen space within which justice be to be dispense by they the time seem to have arrive which claim for member of the supreme court a relief from itinerary fatigue incompatible as well with the age which a portion of they will always have attain as with the research and preparation which be due to their station and to the juridical reputation of their country and consideration equally cogent require a more convenient organization of the subordinate tribunal which may be accomplish without an objectionable increase of the number or expense of the judge the extent and variety of executive business also accumulate with the progress of our country and its grow population call for an additional department to be charge with duty now over- burden other department and with such as have not be annex to any department the course of experience recommend as another improvement in the executive establishment that the provision for the station of attorney general whose residence at the seat of government official connection with it and the management of the public business before the judiciary preclude an extensive participation in professional emolument be make more adequate to his service and his relinquishment and that with a view to his reasonable accommodation and to a proper depository of his official opinion and proceeding there be include in the provision the usual appurtenance to a public office in direct the legislative attention to the state of the finance it be a subject of great gratification to find that even within the short period which have elapse since the return of peace the revenue have far exceed all the current demand upon the treasury and that under any probable diminution of its future annual product which the vicissitude of commerce may occasion it will afford an ample fund for the effectual and early extinguishment of the public debt it have be estimate that during the year 1816 the actual receipt of revenue at the treasury include the balance at the commencement of the year and exclude the proceed of loan and treasury note will amount to about the sum of $ 47,000,000 that during the same year the actual payment at the treasury include the payment of the arrearage of the war department as well as the payment of a considerable excess beyond the annual appropriation will amount to about the sum of $ 38 m and that consequently at the close of the year there will be a surplus in the treasury of about the sum of $ 9m. the operation of the treasury continue to be obstruct by difficulty arise from the condition of the national currency but they have nevertheless be effectual to a beneficial extent in the reduction of the public debt and the establishment of the public credit the float debt of treasury note and temporary loan will soon be entirely discharge the aggregate of the fund debt compose of debt incur during the war of 1776 and 1812 have be estimate with reference to the first of january next at a sum not exceed $ 110m. the ordinary annual expense of the government for the maintenance of all its institution civil military and naval have be estimate at a sum of $ 20 m and the permanent revenue to be derive from all the exist source have be estimate at a sum of $ 25m. upon this general view of the subject it be obvious that there be only want to the fiscal prosperity of the government the restoration of an uniform medium of exchange the resource and the faith of the nation display in the system which congress have establish insure respect and confidence both at home and abroad the local accumulation of the revenue have already enable the treasury to meet the public engagement in the local currency of most of the states and it be expect that the same cause will produce the same effect throughout the union but for the interest of the community at large as well as for the purpose of the treasury it be essential that the nation should possess a currency of equal value credit and use wherever it may circulate the constitution have intrust congress exclusively with the power of create and regulate a currency of that description and the measure which be take during the last session in execution of the power give every promise of success the bank of the united states have be organize under auspex the most favorable and can not fail to be an important auxiliary to those measure for a more enlarged view of the public finance with a view of the measure pursue by the treasury department previous to the resignation of the late secretary i transmit an extract from the last report of that officer congress will perceive in it ample proof of the solid foundation on which the financial prosperity of the nation rest and will do justice to the distinguished ability and successful exertion with which the duty of the department be execute during a period remarkable for its difficulty and its peculiar perplexity the period of my retire from the public service be at little distance i shall find no occasion more proper than the present for express to my fellow citizen my deep sense of the continue confidence and kind support which i have receive from they my grateful recollection of these distinguished mark of their favorable regard can never cease and with the consciousness that if i have not serve my country with great ability i have serve it with a sincere devotion will accompany i as a source of unfaile gratification happily i shall carry with i from the public theater other source which those who love their country most will well appreciate i shall behold it bless with tranquillity and prosperity at home and with peace and respect abroad i can indulge the proud reflection that the american people have reach in safety and success their 40th year as an independent nation that for nearly an entire generation they have have experience of their present constitution the off spring of their undisturbed deliberation and of their free choice that they have find it to bear the trial of adverse as well as prosperous circumstance to contain in its combination of the federate and elective principle a reconcilement of public strength with individual liberty of national power for the defense of national right with a security against war of injustice of ambition and vain glory in the fundamental provision which subject all question of war to the will of the nation itself which be to pay its cost and feel its calamity nor be it less a peculiar felicity of this constitution so dear to we all that it be find to be capable without lose its vital energy of expand itself over a spacious territory with the increase and expansion of the community for whose benefit it be establish and may i not be allow to add to this gratifying spectacle that i shall read in the character of the american people in their devotion to true liberty and to the constitution which be its palladium sure presage that the destine career of my country will exhibit a government pursue the public good as its sole object and regulate its mean by the great principle consecrate in its charger and by those moral principle to which they be so well ally a government which watch over the purity of election the freedom of speech and of the press the trial by jury and the equal interdict against encroachment and compact between religion and the state which maintain inviolably the maxim of public faith the security of person and property and encourage in every authorized mode the general diffusion of knowledge which guarantee to public liberty its permanency and to those who possess the blessing the true enjoyment of it a government which avoid intrusion on the internal repose of other nation and repel they from its own which do justice to all nation with a readiness equal to the firmness with which it require justice from they and which whilst it refine its domestic code from every ingredient not congenial with the precept of an enlighten age and the sentiment of a virtuous people seek by appeal to reason and by its liberal example to infuse into the law which govern the civilized world a spirit which may diminish the frequency or circumscribe the calamity of war and meliorate the social and beneficent relation of peace a government in a word whose conduct within and without may bespeak the most noble of ambition that of promote peace on earth and good will to man these contemplation sweeten the remnant of my day will animate my prayer for the happiness of my beloved country and a perpetuity of the institution under which it be enjoy
to the house of representatives of the united states having consider the bill this day present to i entitle an act to set apart and pledge certain fund for internal improvement and which set apart and pledge fund for construct road and canal and improve the navigation of water course in order to facilitate promote and give security to internal commerce among the several states and to render more easy and less expensive the mean and provision for the common defense i be constrain by the insuperable difficulty i feel in reconcile the bill with the constitution of the united states to return it with that objection to the house of representatives in which it originate the legislative power vest in congress be specify and enumerate in the eighth section of the first article of the constitution and it do not appear that the power propose to be exercise by the bill be among the enumerate power or that it fall by any just interpretation within the power to make law necessary and proper for carry into execution those or other power vest by the constitution in the government of the united states "the power to regulate commerce among the several states can not include a power to construct road and canal and to improve the navigation of water course in order to facilitate promote and secure such a commerce without a latitude of construction depart from the ordinary import of the term strengthen by the know inconvenience which doubtless lead to the grant of this remedial power to congress to refer the power in question to the clause to provide for the common defense and general welfare would be contrary to the established and consistent rule of interpretation as render the special and careful enumeration of power which follow the clause nugatory and improper such a view of the constitution would have the effect of give to congress a general power of legislation instead of the define and limited one hitherto understand to belong to they the term common defense and general welfare embrace every object and act within the purview of a legislative trust it would have the effect of subject both the constitution and law of the several states in all case not specifically exempt to be supersede by law of congress it be expressly declare that the constitution of the united states and law make in pursuance thereof shall be the supreme law of the land and the judge of every state shall be bind thereby anything in the constitution or law of any state to the contrary notwithstanding such a view of the constitution finally would have the effect of exclude the judicial authority of the united states from its participation in guard the boundary between the legislative power of the general and the state governments inasmuch as question relate to the general welfare be question of policy and expediency be unsusceptible of judicial cognizance and decision a restriction of the power to provide for the common defense and general welfare to case which be to be provide for by the expenditure of money would still leave within the legislative power of congress all the great and most important measure of government money be the ordinary and necessary mean of carry they into execution if a general power to construct road and canal and to improve the navigation of water course with the train of power incident thereto be not possess by congress the assent of the states in the mode provide in the bill can not confer the power the only case in which the consent and cession of particular states can extend the power of congress be those specify and provide for in the constitution i be not unaware of the great importance of road and canal and the improved navigation of water course and that a power in the national legislature to provide for they might be exercise with signal advantage to the general prosperity but see that such a power be not expressly give by the constitution and believe that it can not be deduce from any part of it without an inadmissible latitude of construction and a reliance on insufficient precedent believe also that the permanent success of the constitution depend on a definite partition of power between the general and the state governments and that no adequate landmark would be leave by the constructive extension of the power of congress as propose in the bill i have no option but to withhold my signature from it and to cherish the hope that its beneficial object may be attain by a resort for the necessary power to the same wisdom and virtue in the nation which establish the constitution in its actual form and providently mark out in the instrument itself a safe and practicable mode of improve it as experience might suggest james madison
i should be destitute of feeling if i be not deeply affect by the strong proof which my fellow citizen have give i of their confidence in call i to the high office whose function i be about to assume as the expression of their good opinion of my conduct in the public service i derive from it a gratification which those who be conscious of having do all that they could to merit it can alone feel my sensibility be increase by a just estimate of the importance of the trust and of the nature and extent of its duty with the proper discharge of which the high interest of a great and free people be

duty of the chief executive office it have be the practice of the distinguished man who have go before i to explain the principle which would govern they in their respective administration in follow their venerate example my attention be naturally draw to the great cause which have contribute in a principal degree to produce the present happy condition of the united states they will well explain the nature of our duty and shed much light on the policy which ought to be pursue in future from the commencement of our revolution to the present day almost forty year have elapse and from the establishment of this constitution twenty eight through this whole term the government have be what may emphatically be call self government and what have be the effect to whatever object we turn our attention whether it relate to our foreign or domestic concern we find abundant cause to felicitate ourselves in the excellence of our institution during a period fraught with difficulty and mark by very extraordinary event the united states have flourish beyond example their citizen individually have be happy and the nation prosperous under this constitution our commerce have be wisely regulate with foreign nation and between the states new states have be admit into our union our territory have be enlarge by fair and honorable treaty and with great advantage to the original states the states respectively protect by the national government under a mild parental system against foreign danger and enjoy within their separate sphere by a wise partition of power a just proportion of the sovereignty have improve their police extend their settlement and attain a strength and maturity which be the good proof of wholesome law well administer and if we look to the condition of individual what a proud spectacle do it exhibit on whom have oppression fall in any quarter of our union who have be deprive of any right of person or property who restrain from offer his vow in the mode which he prefer to the divine author of his being it be well know that all these blessing have be enjoy in their full extent and i add with peculiar satisfaction that there have be no example of a capital punishment be inflict on anyone for the crime of high treason some who might admit the competency of our government to these beneficent duty might doubt it in trial which put to the test its strength and efficiency as a member of the great community of nation here too experience have afford we the most satisfactory proof in its favor just as this constitution be put into action several of the principal states of europe have become much agitated and some of they seriously convulse destructive war ensue which have of late only be terminate in the course of these conflict the united states receive great injury from several of the party it be their interest to stand aloof from the contest to demand justice from the party commit the injury and to cultivate by a fair and honorable conduct the friendship of all war become at length inevitable and the result have show that our government be equal to that the great of trial under the most unfavorable circumstance of the virtue of the people and of the heroic exploit of the army the navy and the militia i need not speak such then be the happy government under which we live a government adequate to every purpose for which the social compact be form a government elective in all its branch under which every citizen may by his merit obtain the high trust recognize by the constitution which contain within it no cause of discord none to put at variance one portion of the community with another a government which protect every citizen in the full enjoyment of his right and be able to protect the nation against injustice from foreign power other consideration of the high importance admonish we to cherish our union and to cling to the government which support it fortunate as we be in our political institution we have not be less so in other circumstance on which our prosperity and happiness essentially depend situate within the temperate zone and extend through many degree of latitude along the atlantic the united states enjoy all the variety of climate and every production incident to that portion of the globe penetrate internally to the great lakes and beyond the source of the great river which communicate through our whole interior no country be ever happy with respect to its domain bless too with a fertile soil our produce have always be very abundant leave even in year the least favorable a surplus for the want of our fellow man in other country such be our peculiar felicity that there be not a part of our union that be not particularly interested in preserve it the great agricultural interest of the nation prosper under its protection local interest be not less foster by it our fellow citizen of the north engage in navigation find great encouragement in be make the favor carrier of the vast production of the other portion of the united states while the inhabitant of these be amply recompensed in their turn by the nursery for seaman and naval force thus form and rear up for the support of our common right our manufacture find a generous encouragement by the policy which patronize domestic industry and the surplus of our produce a steady and profitable market by local want in less favor part at home such then be the highly favor condition of our country it be the interest of every citizen to maintain it what be the danger which menace we if any exist they ought to be ascertain and guard against in explain my sentiment on this subject it may be ask what raise we to the present happy state how do we accomplish the revolution how remedy the defect of the first instrument of our union by infuse into the national government sufficient power for national purpose without impair the just right of the states or affect those of individual how sustain and pass with glory through the late war the government have be in the hand of the people to the people therefore and to the faithful and able depositary of their trust be the credit due have the people of the united states be educate in different principle have they be less intelligent less independent or less virtuous can it be believe that we should have maintain the same steady and consistent career or be bless with the same success while then the constituent body retain its present sound and healthful state everything will be safe they will choose competent and faithful representative for every department it be only when the people become ignorant and corrupt when they degenerate into a populace that they be incapable of exercise the sovereignty usurpation be then an easy attainment and an usurper soon find the people themselves become the willing instrument of their own debasement and ruin let we then look to the great cause and endeavor to preserve it in full force let we by all wise and constitutional measure promote intelligence among the people as the good mean of preserve our liberty danger from abroad be not less deserving of attention experience the fortune of other nation the united states may be again involve in war and it may in that event be the object of the adverse party to overset our government to break our union and demolish we as a nation our distance from europe and the just moderate and pacific policy of our government may form some security against these danger but they ought to be anticipate and guard against many of our citizen be engage in commerce and navigation and all of they be in a certain degree dependent on their prosperous state many be engage in the fishery these interest be expose to invasion in the war between other power and we should disregard the faithful admonition of experience if we do not expect it we must support our right or lose our character and with it perhaps our liberty a people who fail to do it can scarcely be say to hold a place among independent nation national honor be national property of the high value the sentiment in the mind of every citizen be national strength it ought therefore to be cherish to secure we against these danger our coast and inland frontier should be fortify our army and navy regulate upon just principle as to the force of each be keep in perfect order and our militia be place on the well practicable footing to put our extensive coast in such a state of defense as to secure our city and interior from invasion will be attend with expense but the work when finished will be permanent and it be fair to presume that a single campaign of invasion by a naval force superior to our own aid by a few thousand land troop would expose we to great expense without take into the estimate the loss of property and distress of our citizen than would be sufficient for this great work our land and naval force should be moderate but adequate to the necessary purpose the former to garrison and preserve our fortification and to meet the first invasion of a foreign foe and while constitute the element of a great force to preserve the science as well as all the necessary implement of war in a state to be bring into activity in the event of war the latter retain within the limit proper in a state of peace might aid in maintain the neutrality of the united states with dignity in the war of other power and in save the property of their citizen from spoliation in time of war with the enlargement of which the great naval resource of the country render it susceptible and which should be duly foster in time of peace it would contribute essentially both as an auxiliary of defense and as a powerful engine of annoyance to diminish the calamity of war and to bring the war to a speedy and honorable termination but it ought always to be hold prominently in view that the safety of these states and of everything dear to a free people must depend in an eminent degree on the militia invasion may be make too formidable to be resist by any land and naval force which it would comport either with the principle of our government or the circumstance of the united states to maintain in such case recourse must be have to the great body of the people and in a manner to produce the good effect it be of the high importance therefore that they be so organized and train as to be prepare for any emergency the arrangement should be such as to put at the command of the government the ardent patriotism and youthful vigor of the country if form on equal and just principle it can not be oppressive it be the crisis which make the pressure and not the law which provide a remedy for it this arrangement should be form too in time of peace to be the well prepared for war with such an organization of such a people the united states have nothing to dread from foreign invasion at its approach an overwhelming force of gallant man might always be put in motion other interest of high importance will claim attention among which the improvement of our country by road and canal proceed always with a constitutional sanction hold a distinguished place by thus facilitate the intercourse between the states we shall add much to the convenience and comfort of our fellow citizen much to the ornament of the country and what be of great importance we shall shorten distance and by make each part more accessible to and dependent on the other we shall bind the union more closely together nature have do so much for we by intersect the country with so many great river bay and lake approach from distant point so near to each other that the inducement to complete the work seem to be peculiarly strong a more interesting spectacle be perhaps never see than be exhibit within the limit of the united states a territory so vast and advantageously situate contain object so grand so useful so happily connect in all their part our manufacturer will likewise require the systematic and fostering care of the government possess as we do all the raw material the fruit of our own soil and industry we ought not to depend in the degree we have do on supply from other country while we be thus dependent the sudden event of war unsought and unexpected can not fail to plunge we into the most serious difficulty it be important too that the capital which nourish our manufacturer should be domestic as its influence in that case instead of exhaust as it may do in foreign hand would be feel advantageously on agriculture and every other branch of industry equally important be it to provide at home a market for our raw material as by extend the competition it will enhance the price and protect the cultivator against the casualty incident to foreign market with the indian tribe it be our duty to cultivate friendly relation and to act with kindness and liberality in all our transaction equally proper be it to persevere in our effort to extend to they the advantage of civilization the great amount of our revenue and the flourishing state of the treasury be a full proof of the competency of the national resource for any emergency as they be of the willingness of our fellow citizen to bear the burden which the public necessity require the vast amount of vacant land the value of which daily augment form an additional resource of great extent and duration these resource besides accomplish every other necessary purpose put it completely in the power of the united states to discharge the national debt at an early period peace be the good time for improvement and preparation of every kind it be in peace that our commerce flourish most that taxis be most easily pay and that the revenue be most productive the executive be charge officially in the departments under it with the disbursement of the public money and be responsible for the faithful application of it to the purpose for which it be raise the legislature be the watchful guardian over the public purse it be its duty to see that the disbursement have be honestly make to meet the requisite responsibility every facility should be afford to the executive to enable it to bring the public agent intrust with the public money strictly and promptly to account nothing should be presume against they but if with the requisite facility the public money be suffer to lie long and uselessly in their hand they will not be the only defaulter nor will the demoralize effect be confine to they it will evince a relaxation and want of tone in the administration which will be feel by the whole community i shall do all i can to secure economy and fidelity in this important branch of the administration and i doubt not that the legislature will perform its duty with equal zeal a thorough examination should be regularly make and i will promote it it be particularly gratify to i to enter on the discharge of these duty at a time when the united states be bless with peace it be a state most consistent with their prosperity and happiness it will be my sincere desire to preserve it so far as depend on the executive on just principle with all nation claim nothing unreasonable of any and render to each what be its due equally gratifying be it to witness the increase harmony of opinion which pervade our union discord do not belong to our system union be recommend as well by the free and benign principle of our government extend its blessing to every individual as by the other eminent advantage attend it the american people have encounter together great danger and sustain severe trial with success they constitute one great family with a common interest experience have enlighten we on some question of essential importance to the country the progress have be slow dictate by a just reflection and a faithful regard to every interest connect with it to promote this harmony in accord with the principle of our republican government and in a manner to give they the most complete effect and to advance in all other respect the good interest of our union will be the object of my constant and zealous exertion never do a government commence under auspex so favorable nor ever be success so complete if we look to the history of other nation ancient or modern we find no example of a growth so rapid so gigantic of a people so prosperous and happy in contemplate what we have still to perform the heart of every citizen must expand with joy when he reflect how near our government have approach to perfection that in respect to it we have no essential improvement to make that the great object be to preserve it in the essential principle and feature which characterize it and that be to be do by preserve the virtue and enlighten the mind of the people and as a security against foreign danger to adopt such arrangement as be indispensable to the support of our independence our right and liberty if we persevere in the career in which we have advance so far and in the path already trace we can not fail under the favor of a gracious providence to attain the high destiny which seem to await we in the administration of the illustrious man who have precede i in this high station with some of whom i have be connect by the close tie from early life example be present which will always be find highly instructive and useful to their successor from these i shall endeavor to derive all the advantage which they may afford of my immediate predecessor under whom so important a portion of this great and successful experiment have be make i shall be pardon for express my earnest wish that he may long enjoy in his retirement the affection of a grateful country the good reward of exalt talent and the most faithful and meritorious service rely on the aid to be derive from the other department of the government i enter on the trust to which i have be call by the suffrage of my fellow citizen with my fervent prayer to the almighty that he will be graciously pleased to continue to we that protection which he have already so conspicuously display in our favor

country the abundant fruit of the earth have fill it with plenty an extensive and profitable commerce have greatly augment our revenue the public credit have attain an extraordinary elevation our preparation for defense in case of future war from which by the experience of all nation we ought not to expect to be exempt be advance under a well digest system with all the dispatch which so important a work will admit our free government found on the interest and affection of the people have gain and be daily gain strength local jealousy be rapidly yield to more generous enlarge and enlighten view of national policy for advantage so numerous and highly important it be our duty to unite in grateful acknowledgement to that omnipotent be from whom they be derive and in uncease prayer that he will endow we with virtue and strength to maintain and hand they down in their utmost purity to our late posterity i have the satisfaction to inform you that an arrangement which have be commence by my predecessor with the british government for the reduction of the naval force by great britain and the united states on the lake have be conclude by which it be provide that neither party shall keep in service on lake champlain more than one vessel on lake ontario more than one and on lake erie and the upper lake more than two to be arm each with one cannon only and that all the other armed vessel of both party of which an exact list be interchange shall be dismantle it be also agree that the force retain shall be restrict in its duty to the internal purpose of each party and that the arrangement shall remain in force until six month shall have expire after notice give by one of the party to the other of its desire that it should terminate by this arrangement useless expense on both side and what be of still great importance the danger of collision between armed vessel in those inland water which be great be prevent i have the satisfaction also to state that the commissioner under the fourth article of the treaty of ghent to whom it be refer to decide to which party the several island in the bay of passamaquoddy belong under the treaty of 1783 have agree in a report by which all the island in the possession of each party before the late war have be decree to it the commissioner act under the other article of the treaty of ghent for the settlement of boundary have also be engage in the discharge of their respective duty but have not yet complete they the difference which arise between the two government under that treaty respect the right of the u.s. to take and cure fish on the coast of the british province north of our limit which have be secure by the treaty of 1783 be still in negotiation the proposition make by this government to extend to the colony of gb the principle of the convention of london by which the commerce between the port of the united states and british port in europe have be place on a footing of equality have be decline by the british government this subject having be thus amicably discuss between the two government and it appear that the british government be unwilling to depart from its present regulation it remain for congress to decide whether they will make any other regulation in consequence thereof for the protection and improvement of our navigation the negotiation with spain for spoliation on our commerce and the settlement of boundary remain essentially in the state it hold by the communication that be make to congress by my predecessor it have be evidently the policy of the spanish government to keep the negotiation suspend and in this the united states have acquiesce from an amicable disposition toward spain and in the expectation that her government would from a sense of justice finally accede to such an arrangement as would be equal between the party a disposition have be lately show by the spanish government to move in the negotiation which have be meet by this government and should the conciliatory and friendly policy which have invariably guide our council be reciprocate a just and satisfactory arrangement may be expect it be proper however to remark that no proposition have yet be make from which such a result can be presume it be anticipate at an early stage that the contest between spain and the colony would become highly interesting to the united states it be natural that our citizen should sympathize in event which affect their neighbor it seem probable also that the prosecution of the conflict along our coast and in contiguous country would occasionally interrupt our commerce and otherwise affect the person and property of our citizen these anticipation have be realize such injury have be receive from person act under authority of both the party and for which redress have in most instance be withhold through every stage of the conflict the united states have maintain an impartial neutrality give aid to neither of the party in man money ship or munition of war they have regard the contest not in the light of an ordinary insurrection or rebellion but as a civil war between party nearly equal have as to neutral power equal right our port have be open to both and every article the fruit of our soil or of the industry of our citizen which either be permit to take have be equally free to the other should the colony establish their independence it be proper now to state that this government neither seek nor would accept from they any advantage in commerce or otherwise which will not be equally open to all other nation the colony will in that event become independent state free from any obligation to or connection with we which it may not then be their interest to form on the basis of a fair reciprocity in the summer of the present year an expedition be set on foot against east florida by person claim to act under the authority of some of the colony who take possession of amelia island at the mouth of the st. marys river near the boundary of the state of georgia as this province lie eastward of the mississippi and be bound by the united states and the ocean on every side and have be a subject of negotiation with the government of spain as an indemnity for loss by spoliation or in exchange for territory of equal value westward of the mississippi a fact well know to the world it excite surprise that any countenance should be give to this measure by any of the colony as it would be difficult to reconcile it with the friendly relation exist between the united states and the colony a doubt be entertain whether it have be authorize by they or any of they this doubt have gain strength by the circumstance which have unfold themselves in the prosecution of the enterprise which have mark it as a mere private unauthorized adventure project and commence with an incompetent force reliance seem to have be place on what might be draw in defiance of our law from within our limit and of late as their resource have fail it have assume a more marked character of unfriendliness to we the island be make a channel for the illicit introduction of slave from africa into the united states an asylum for fugitive slave from the neighboring state and a port for smuggling of every kind a similar establishment be make at an early period by person of the same description in the gulf of mexico at a place call galvezton within the limit of the united states as we contend under the cession of louisiana this enterprise have be mark in a more signal manner by all the objectionable circumstance which characterize the other and more particularly by the equipment of privateer which have annoy our commerce and by smuggle these establishment if ever sanction by any authority whatever which be not believe have abuse their trust and forfeit all claim to consideration a just regard for the right and interest of the united states require that they should be suppress and order have be accordingly issue to that effect the imperious consideration which produce this measure will be explain to the party whom it may in any degree concern to obtain correct information on every subject in which the united states be interested to inspire just sentiment in all person in authority on either side of our friendly disposition so far as it may comport with an impartial neutrality and to secure proper respect to our commerce in every port and from every flag it have be think proper to send a ship of war with three distinguished citizen along the southern coast with these purpose with the exist authority with those in the possession of and exercise the sovereignty must the communication be hold from they alone can redress for past injury commit by person act under they be obtain by they alone can the commission of the like in future be prevent our relation with the other power of europe have experience no essential change since the last session in our intercourse with each due attention continue to be pay to the protection of our commerce and to every other object in which the united states be interested a strong hope be entertain that by adhere to the maxim of a just a candid and friendly policy we may long preserve amicable relation with all the power of europe on condition advantageous and honorable to our country with the barbary state and the indian tribe our pacific relation have be preserve in call your attention to the internal concern of our country the view which they exhibit be peculiarly gratifying the payment which have be make into the treasury show the very productive state of the public revenue after satisfy the appropriation make by law for the support of the civil government and of the military and naval establishment embrace suitable provision for fortification and for the gradual increase of the navy pay the interest of the public debt and extinguish more than $ 18 million of the principal within the present year it be estimate that a balance of more than $ 6 million will remain in the treasury on the first day of january applicable to the current service of the ensue year the payment into the treasury during the year 1818 on account of impost and tonnage result principally from duty which have accrue in the present year may be fairly estimate at $ 20 million the internal revenue at $ 2.5 million the public land at $ 1.5 million bank dividend and incidental receipt at $ 500,000 make in the whole $ 24.5 million the annual permanent expenditure for the support of the civil government and of the army and navy as now establish by law amount to $ 11.8 million and for the sink fund to $ 10 million make in the whole $ 21.8 million leave an annual excess of revenue beyond the expenditure of $ 2.7 million exclusive of the balance estimate to be in the treasury on the first day of january 1818.in the present state of the treasury the whole of the louisiana debt may be redeem in the year 1819 after which if the public debt continue as it now be above par there will be annually about $ 5 million of the sink fund unexpended until the year 1825 when the loan of 1812 and the stock create by fund treasury note will be redeemable it be also estimate that the mississippi stock will be discharge during the year 1819 from the proceed of the public land assign to that object after which the receipt from those land will annually add to the public revenue the sum of $ 1.5 million make the permanent annual revenue amount to $ 26 million and leave an annual excess of revenue after the year 1819 beyond the permanent authorized expenditure of more than $ 4 million by the last return to the department of war the militia force of the several state may be estimate at 800,000 men&mdash;infantry artillery and cavalry great part of this force be arm and measure be take to arm the whole an improvement in the organization and discipline of the militia be one of the great object which claim the unremitted attention of congress the regular force amount nearly to the number require by law and be station along the atlantic and inland frontier of the naval force it have be necessary to maintain strong squadron in the mediterranean and in the gulf of mexico from several of the indian tribe inhabit the country border on lake erie purchase have be make of land on condition very favorable to the united states and as it be presume not less so to the tribe themselves by these purchase the indian title with moderate reservation have be extinguish to the whole of the land within the limit of the state of ohio and to a part of that in the michigan territory and of the state of indiana from the cherokee tribe a tract have be purchase in the state of georgia and an arrangement make by which in exchange for land beyond the mississippi a great part if not the whole of the land belong to that tribe eastward of that river in the state of north carolina georgia and tennessee and in the alabama territory will soon be acquire by these acquisition and other that may reasonably be expect soon to follow we shall be enable to extend our settlement from the inhabited part of the state of ohio along lake erie into the michigan territory and to connect our settlement by degree through the state of indiana and the illinois territory to that of missouri a similar and equally advantageous effect will soon be produce to the south through the whole extent of the state and territory which border on the water empty into the mississippi and the mobile in this progress which the right of nature demand and nothing can prevent mark a growth rapid and gigantic it be our duty to make new effort for the preservation improvement and civilization of the native inhabitant the hunter state can exist only in the vast uncultivated desert it yield to the more dense and compact form and great force of civilized population and of right it ought to yield for the earth be give to mankind to support the great number of which it be capable and no tribe or people have a right to withhold from the want of other more than be necessary for their own support and comfort it be gratify to know that the reservation of land make by the treaty with the tribe on lake erie be make with a view to individual ownership among they and to the cultivation of the soil by all and that an annual stipend have be pledge to supply their other want it will merit the consideration of congress whether other provision not stipulate by treaty ought to be make for these tribe and for the advancement of the liberal and humane policy of the united states toward all the tribe within our limit and more particularly for their improvement in the art of civilized life among the advantage incident to these purchase and to those which have precede the security which may thereby be afford to our inland frontier be peculiarly important with a strong barrier consist of our own people thus plant on the lakes the mississippi and the mobile with the protection to be derive from the regular force indian hostility if they do not altogether cease will henceforth lose their terror fortification in those quarter to any extent will not be necessary and the expense of attend they may be save a people accustom to the use of firearm only as the indian tribe be will shun even moderate work which be defend by cannon great fortification will therefore be requisite only in future along the coast and at some point in the interior connect with it on these will the safety of our town and the commerce of our great river from the bay of fundy to the mississippi depend on these therefore should the utmost attention skill and labor be bestow a considerable and rapid augmentation in the value of all the public land proceed from these and other obvious case may henceforward be expect the difficulty attend early emigration will be dissipate even in the most remote part several new state have be admit into our union to the west and south and territorial government happily organize establish over every other portion in which there be vacant land for sale in terminate indian hostility as must soon be do in a formidable shape at least the emigration which have heretofore be great will probably increase and the demand for land and the augmentation in its value be in like proportion the great increase of our population throughout the union will alone produce an important effect and in no quarter will it be so sensibly feel as in those in contemplation the public land be a public stock which ought to be dispose of to the good advantage for the nation the nation should therefore derive the profit proceeding from the continual rise in their value every encouragement should be give to the emigrant consistent with a fair competition between they but that competition should operate in the first sale to the advantage of the nation rather than of individual great capitalist will derive the benefit incident to their superior wealth under any mode of sale which may be adopt but if look forward to the rise in the value of the public land they should have the opportunity of amass at a low price vast body in their hand the profit will accrue to they and not to the public they would also have the power in that degree to control the emigration and settlement in such a manner as their opinion of their respective interest might dictate i submit this subject to the consideration of congress that such further provision may be make in the sale of the public land with a view to the public interest should any be deem expedient as in their judgment may be well adapt to the object when we consider the vast extent of territory within the united states the great amount and value of its production the connection of its part and other circumstance on which their prosperity and happiness depend we can not fail to entertain a high sense of the advantage to be derive from the facility which may be afford in the intercourse between they by mean of good road and canal never do a country of such vast extent offer equal inducement to improvement of this kind nor ever be consequence of such magnitude involve in they as this subject be act on by congress at the last session and there may be a disposition to revive it at the present i have bring it into view for the purpose of communicate my sentiment on a very important circumstance connect with it with that freedom and candor which a regard for the public interest and a proper respect for congress require a difference of opinion have exist from the first formation of our constitution to the present time among our most enlightened and virtuous citizen respect the right of congress to establish such a system of improvement take into view the trust with which i be now honor it would be improper after what have pass that this discussion should be revive with an uncertainty of my opinion respect the right disregard early impression i have bestow on the subject all the deliberation which its great importance and a just sense of my duty require and the result be a settle conviction in my mind that congress do not possess the right it be not contain in any of the specify power grant to congress nor can i consider it incidental to or a necessary mean view on the most liberal scale for carry into effect any of the power which be specifically grant in communicate this result i can not resist the obligation which i feel to suggest to congress the propriety of recommend to the state the adoption of an amendment to the constitution which shall give to congress the right in question in case of doubtful construction especially of such vital interest it comport with the nature and origin of our institution and will contribute much to preserve they to apply to our constituent for an explicit grant of the power we may confidently rely that if it appear to their satisfaction that the power be necessary it will always be grant in this case i be happy to observe that experience have afford the most ample proof of its utility and that the benign spirit of conciliation and harmony which now manifest itself throughout our union promise to such a recommendation the most prompt and favorable result i think proper to suggest also in case this measure be adopt that it be recommend to the state to include in the amendment seek a right in congress to institute likewise seminary of learn for the all important purpose of diffuse knowledge among our fellow citizen throughout the united states our manufactory will require the continued attention of congress the capital employ in they be considerable and the knowledge acquire in the machinery and fabric of all the most useful manufacture be of great value their preservation which depend on due encouragement be connect with the high interest of the nation although the progress of the public building have be as favorable as circumstance have permit it be to be regret that the capitol be not yet in a state to receive you there be good cause to presume that the two wing the only part as yet commence will be prepare for that purpose at the next session the time seem now to have arrive when this subject may be deem worthy the attention of congress on a scale adequate to national purpose the completion of the middle building will be necessary to the convenient accommodation of congress of the committee and various office belong to it it be evident that the other public building be altogether insufficient for the accommodation of the several executive department some of whom be much crowded and even subject to the necessity of obtain it in private building at some distance from the head of the department and with inconvenience to the management of the public business most nation have take an interest and a pride in the improvement and ornament of their metropolis and none be more conspicuous in that respect than the ancient republic the policy which dictate the establishment of a permanent residence for the national government and the spirit in which it be commence and have be prosecute show that such improvement be think worthy the attention of this nation its central position between the northern and southern extreme of our union and its approach to the west at the head of a great navigable river which interlock with the western water prove the wisdom of the council which establish it nothing appear to be more reasonable and proper than that convenient accommodation should be provide on a well digest plan for the head of the several department and for the attorney general and it be believe that the public ground in the city apply to these object will be find amply sufficient i submit this subject to the consideration of congress that such further provision may be make in it as to they may seem proper it be contemplate the happy situation of the united states our attention be draw with peculiar interest to the survive officer and soldier of our revolutionary army who so eminently contribute by their service to lay its foundation most of those very meritorious citizen have pay the debt of nature and go to repose it be believe that among the survivor there be some not provide for by exist law who be reduce to indigence and even to real distress these man have a claim on the gratitude of their country and it will do honor to their country to provide for they the lapse of a few year more and the opportunity will be forever lose indeed so long already have be the interval that the number to be benefit by any provision which may be make will not be great it appear in a satisfactory manner that the revenue arise from impost and tonnage and from the sale of the public land will be fully adequate to the support of the civil government of the present military and naval establishment include the annual augmentation of the latter to the extent provide for to the payment of the interest of the public debt and to the extinguishment of it at the time authorize without the aid of the internal taxis i consider it my duty to recommend to congress their repeal to impose taxis when the public exigency require they be an obligation of the most sacred character especially with a free people the faithful fulfillment of it be among the high proof of their value and capacity for self government to dispense with taxis when it may be do with perfect safety be equally the duty of their representative in this instance we have the satisfaction to know that they be impose when the demand be imperious and have be sustain with exemplary fidelity i have to add that however gratify it may be to i regard the prosperous and happy condition of our country to recommend the repeal of these taxis at this time i shall nevertheless be attentive to event and should any future emergency occur be not less prompt to suggest such measure and burden as may then be requisite and proper
fellow citizens of the senate and of the house of representatives the auspicious circumstance under which you will commence the duty of the present session will lighten the burden inseparable from the high trust commit to you the fruit of the earth have be unusually abundant commerce have flourish the revenue have exceed the most favorable anticipation and peace and amity be preserve with foreign nation on condition just and honorable to our country for these inestimable blessing we can not but be grateful to that providence which watch over the destiny of nation as the term limit for the operation of the commercial convention with great britain will expire early in the month of july next and it be deem important that there should be no interval during which that portion of our commerce which be provide for by that convention should not be regulate either by arrangement between the two government or by the authority of congress the minister of the united states at london be instruct early in the last summer to invite the attention of the british government to the subject with a view to that object he be instruct to propose also that the negotiation which it be wish to open might extend to the general commerce of the two country and to every other interest and unsettled difference between they in the hope that an arrangement might be make on principle of reciprocal advantage which might comprehend and provide in a satisfactory manner for all these high concern i have the satisfaction to state that the proposal be receive by the british government in the spirit which prompt it and that a negotiation have be open at london embrace all these object on full consideration of the great extent and magnitude of the trust it be think proper to commit it to not less than two of our distinguished citizen and in consequence the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the united states at paris have be associate with our envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary at london to both of whom correspond instruction have be give and they be now engage in the discharge of its duty it be proper to add that to prevent any inconvenience result from the delay incident to a negotiation on so many important subject it be agree before enter on it that the exist convention should be continue for a term not less than eight year our relation with spain remain nearly in the state in which they be at the close of the last session the convention of 1802 provide for the adjustment of a certain portion of the claim of our citizen for injury sustain by spoliation and so long suspend by the spanish government have at length be ratify by it but no arrangement have yet be make for the payment of another portion of like claim not less extensive or well found or for other class of claim or for the settlement of boundary these subject have again be bring under consideration in both country but no agreement have be enter into respect they in the mean time event have occur which clearly prove the ill effect of the policy which that government have so long pursue on the friendly relation of the two country which it be presume be at least of as much importance to spain as to the united states to maintain a state of thing have exist in the floridas the tendency of which have be obvious to all who have pay the slight attention to the progress of affair in that quarter throughout the whole of those provinces to which the spanish title extend the government of spain have scarcely be feel its authority have be confine almost exclusively to the wall of pensacola and st. augustine within which only small garrison have be maintain adventurer from every country fugitive from justice and abscond slave have find an asylum there several tribe of indians strong in the of their warrior remarkable for their ferocity and whose settlement extend to our limit inhabit those province these different horde of people connect together disregard on the one side the authority of spain and protect on the other by an imaginary line which separate florida from the united states have violate our law prohibit the introduction of slave have practice various fraud on our revenue and commit every kind of outrage on our peaceable citizen which their proximity to we enable they to perpetrate the invasion of amelia island last year by a small band of adventurer not exceed 150 in number who wrest it from the inconsiderable spanish force station there and hold it several month during which a single feeble effort only be make to recover it which fail clearly prove how completely extinct the spanish authority have become as the conduct of those adventurer while in possession of the island as distinctly show the pernicious purpose for which their combination have be form this country have in fact become the theater of every specie of lawless adventure with little population of its own the spanish authority almost extinct and the colonial government in a state of revolution have no pretension to it and sufficiently employ in their own concern it be in great measure derelict and the object of cupidity to every adventurer a system of buccaneering be rapidly organize over it which menace in its consequence the lawful commerce of every nation and particularly the united states while it present a temptation to every people on whose seduction its success principally depend in regard to the united states the pernicious effect of this unlawful combination be not confine to the ocean the indian tribe have constitute the effective force in florida with these tribe these adventurer have form at an early period a connection with a view to avail themselves of that force to promote their own project of accumulation and aggrandizement it be to the interference of some of these adventurer in misrepresent the claim and title of the indians to land and in practice on their savage propensity that the seminole war be principally to be trace man who thus connect themselves with savage community and stimulate they to war which be always attend on their part with act of barbarity the most shocking deserve to be view in a bad light than the savage they would certainly have no claim to an immunity from the punishment which accord to the rule of warfare practice by the savage might justly be inflict on the savage themselves if the embarrassment of spain prevent she from make an indemnity to our citizen for so long a time from her treasury for their loss by spoliation and otherwise it be always in her power to have provide it by the cession of this territory of this her government have be repeatedly apprise and the cession be the more to have be anticipate as spain must have know that in cede it she would likewise relieve herself from the important obligation secure by the treaty of 1795 and all other compromitment respect it if the united states from consideration of these embarrassment decline press their claim in a spirit of hostility the motive ought at least to have be duly appreciate by the government of spain it be well known to her government that other power have make to the united states an indemnity for like loss sustain by their citizen at the same epoch there be nevertheless a limit beyond which this spirit of amity and forbearance can in no instance be justify if it be proper to rely on amicable negotiation for an indemnity for loss it would not have be so to have permit the inability of spain to fulfill her engagement and to sustain her authority in the floridas to be pervert by foreign adventurer and savage to purpose so destructive to the life of our fellow citizen and the high interest of the united states the right of self defense never cease it be among the most sacred and alike necessary to nation and to individual and whether the attack be make by spain herself or by those who abuse her power its obligation be not the less strong the invader of amelia island have assume a popular and respected title under which they might approach and wound we as their object be distinctly see and the duty impose on the executive by an exist law be profoundly feel that mask be not permit to protect they it be think incumbent on the united states to suppress the establishment and it be accordingly do the combination in florida for the unlawful purpose state the act perpetrate by that combination and above all the incitement of the indians to massacre our fellow citizen of every age and of both sex merit a like treatment and receive it in pursue these savage to an imaginary line in the wood it would have be the height of folly to have suffer that line to protect they have that be do the war could never cease even if the territory have be exclusively that of spain and her power complete over it we have a right by the law of nation to follow the enemy on it and to subdue he there but the territory belong in a certain sense at least to the savage enemy who inhabit it the power of spain have cease to exist over it and protection be seek under her title by those who have commit on our citizen hostility which she be bind by treaty to have prevent but have not the power to prevent to have stop at that line would have give new encouragement to these savage and new vigor to the whole combination exist there in the prosecution of all its pernicious purpose in suppress the establishment at amelia island no unfriendliness be manifest toward spain because the post be take from a force which have wrest it from she the measure it be true be not adopt in concert with the spanish government or those in authority under it because in transaction connect with the war in which spain and the colony be engage it be think proper in do justice to the united states to maintain a strict impartiality toward both the belligerent party without consult or act in concert with either it give i pleasure to state that the government of buenos ayres and venezuela whose name be assume have explicitly disclaim all participation in those measure and even the knowledge of they until communicate by this government and have also express their satisfaction that a course of proceeding have be suppress which if justly imputable to they would dishonor their cause in authorize major general jackson to enter florida in pursuit of the seminoles care be take not to encroach on the right of spain i regret to have to add that in execute this order fact be disclose respect the conduct of the officer of spain in authority there in encourage the war furnish munition of war and other supply to carry it on and in other act not less marked which evince their participation in the hostile purpose of that combination and justify the confidence with which it inspire the savage that by those officer they would be protect a conduct so incompatible with the friendly relation exist between the two country particularly with the positive obligation of the 5th article of the treaty of 1795 by which spain be bind to restrain even by force those savage from act of hostility against the united states could not fail to excite surprise the command general be convince that he should fail in his object that he should in effect accomplish nothing if he do not deprive those savage of the resource on which they have calculate and of the protection on which they have rely in make the war as all the document relate to this occurrence will be lay before congress it be not necessary to enter into further detail respect it although the reason which induce major general jackson to take these post be duly appreciate there be nevertheless no hesitation in decide on the course which it become the government to pursue as there be reason to believe that the commander of these post have violate their instruction there be no disposition to impute to their government a conduct so unprovoked and hostile an order be in consequence issue to the general in command there to deliver the post pensacola unconditionally to any person duly authorize to receive it and st. marks which be in the heart of the indian country on the arrival of a competent force to defend it against those savage and their associate in enter florida to suppress this combination no idea be entertain of hostility to spain and however justifiable the command general be in consequence of the misconduct of the spanish officer in enter st. marks and pensacola to terminate it by prove to the savage and their associate that they should not be protect even there yet the amicable relation exist between the united states and spain could not be alter by that act alone by order the restitution of the post those relation be preserve to a change of they the power of the executive be deem incompetent it be vest in congress only by this measure so promptly take due respect be show to the government of spain the misconduct of her officer have not be impute to she she be enable to review with candor her relation with the united states and her own situation particularly in respect to the territory in question with the danger inseparable from it and regard the loss we have sustain for which indemnity have be so long withhold and the injury we have suffer through that territory and her mean of redress she be likewise enable to take with honor the course well calculate to do justice to the united states and to promote her own welfare copy of the instruction to the command general of his correspondence with the secretary of war explain his motive and justify his conduct with a copy of the proceeding of the courts- martial in the trial of arbuthnot and ambristie and of the correspondence between the secretary of state and the minister plenipotentiary of spain near this government and of the minister plenipotentiary of the united states at madrid with the government of spain will be lay before congress the civil war which have so long prevail between spain and the provinces in south america still continue without any prospect of its speedy termination the information respect the condition of those country which have be collect by the commissioner recently return from thence will be lay before congress in copy of their report with such other information as have be receive from other agent of the united states it appear from these communication that the government at buenos ayres declare itself independent in 1816 july having previously exercise the power of an independent government though in the name of the king of spain from the year 1810 that the banda oriental entre rios and paraguay with the city of santa fee all of which be also independent be unconnected with the present government of buenos ayres that chili have declare itself independent and be closely connect with buenos ayres that venezuela have also declare itself independent and now maintain the conflict with various success and that the remain part of south america except monte video and such other portion of the eastern bank of the la plata as be hold by portugal be still in the possession of spain or in a certain degree under her influence by a circular note address by the minister of spain to the allied power with whom they be respectively accredit it appear that the ally have undertake to mediate between spain and the south american provinces and that the manner and extent of their interposition would be settle by a congress which be to have meet at aix la chapelle in september last from the general policy and course of proceeding observe by the allied power in regard to this contest it be infer that they will confine their interposition to the expression of their sentiment abstain from the application of force i state this impression that force will not be apply with the great satisfaction because it be a course more consistent with justice and likewise authorize a hope that the calamity of the war will be confine to the party only and will be of short duration from the view take of this subject found on all the information that we have be able to obtain there be good cause to be satisfied with the course heretofore pursue by the united states in regard to this contest and to conclude that it be proper to adhere to it especially in the present state of affair i have great satisfaction in state that our relation with france russia and other power continue on the most friendly basis in our domestic concern we have ample cause of satisfaction the receipt into the treasury during the three first quarter of the year have exceed $ 17m. after satisfy all the demand which have be make under exist appropriation include the final extinction of the old 6 stock and the redemption of a moiety of the louisiana debt it be estimate that there will remain in the treasury on the 1st day of january next more than $ 2m. it be ascertain that the gross revenue which have accrue from the custom during the same period amount to $ 21 m and that the revenue of the whole year may be estimate at not less than $ 26m. the sale of the public land during the year have also greatly exceed both in quantity and price that of any former year and there be just reason to expect a progressive improvement in that source of revenue it be gratify to know that although the annual expenditure have be increase by the act of the last session of congress provide for revolutionary pension to an amount about equal to the proceed of the internal duty which be then repeal the revenue for the ensue year will be proportionally augment and that whilst the public expenditure will probably remain stationary each successive year will add to the national resource by the ordinary increase of our population and by the gradual development of our latent source of national prosperity the strict execution of the revenue law result principally from the salutary provision of the act of the 20th of april last amend the several collection law have it be presume secure to domestic manufacture all the relief that can be derive from the duty which have be impose upon foreign merchandise for their protection under the influence of this relief several branch of this important national interest have assume great activity and although it be hope that other will gradually revive and ultimately triumph over every obstacle yet the expediency of grant further protection be submit to your consideration the measure of defense authorize by exist law have be pursue with the zeal and activity due to so important an object and with all the dispatch practicable in so extensive and great an undertaking the survey of our maritime and inland frontier have be continue and at the point where it be decide to erect fortification the work have be commence and in some instance considerable progress have be make in compliance with resolution of the last session the board of commissioners be direct to examine in a particular manner the part of the coast therein designated and to report their opinion of the most suitable site for two naval depot this work be in a train of execution the opinion of the board on this subject with a plan of all the work necessary to a general system of defense so far as it have be form will be lay before congress in a report from the proper department as soon as it can be prepare in conformity with the appropriation of the last session treaty have be form with the quapaw tribe of indians inhabit the country on the arkansaw and the great and little osages north of the white river with the tribe in the state of indiana with the several tribe within the state of ohio and the michigan territory and with the chickasaws by which very extensive cession of territory have be make to the united states negotiation be now depend with the tribe in the illinois territory and with the choctaws by which it be expect that other extensive cession will be make i take great interest in state that the cession already make which be consider so important to the united states have be obtain on condition very satisfactory to the indians with a view to the security of our inland frontier it have be think expedient to establish strong post at the mouth of yellow stone river and at the mandan village on the missouri and at the mouth of st. peters on the mississippi at no great distance from our northern boundary it can hardly be presume while such post be maintain in the rear of the indian tribe that they will venture to attack our peaceable inhabitant a strong hope be entertain that this measure will likewise be productive of much good to the tribe themselves especially in promote the great object of their civilization experience have clearly demonstrate that independent savage community can not long exist within the limit of a civilized population the progress of the latter have almost invariably terminate in the extinction of the former especially of the tribe belong to our portion of this hemisphere among whom loftiness of sentiment and gallantry in action have be conspicuous to civilize they and even to prevent their extinction it seem to be indispensable that their independence as community should cease and that the control of the united states over they should be complete and undisputed the hunter state will then be more easily abandon and recourse will be have to the acquisition and culture of land and to other pursuit tend to dissolve the tie which connect they together as a savage community and to give a new character to every individual i present this subject to the consideration of congress on the presumption that it may be find expedient and practicable to adopt some benevolent provision have these object in view relative to the tribe within our settlement it have be necessary during the present year to maintain a strong naval force in the mediterranean and in the gulf of mexico and to send some public ship along the southern coast and to the pacific ocean by these mean amicable relation with the barbary powers have be preserve our commerce have be protect and our right respect the augmentation of our navy be advance with a steady progress toward the limit contemplate by law i communicate with great satisfaction the accession of another state illinois to our union because i perceive from the proof afford by the addition already make the regular progress and sure consummation of a policy of which history afford no example and of which the good effect can not be too highly estimate by extend our government on the principle of our constitution over the vast territory within our limit on the lakes and the mississippi and its numerous stream new life and vigor be infuse into every part of our system by increase the number of the states the confidence of the state government in their own security be increase and their jealousy of the national government proportionally diminish the impracticability of one consolidated government for this great and grow nation will be more apparent and will be universally admit incapable of exercise local authority except for general purpose the general government will no long be dread in those case of a local nature and for all the great purpose for which it be institute its authority will be cherish each government will acquire new force and a great freedom of action within its proper sphere other inestimable advantage will follow our produce will be augment to an incalculable amount in article of the great value for domestic use and foreign commerce our navigation will in like degree be increase and as the shipping of the atlantic states will be employ in the transportation of the vast produce of the western country even those part of the united states which be most remote from each other will be far bind together by the strong tie which mutual interest can create the situation of this district it be think require the attention of congress by the constitution the power of legislation be exclusively vest in the congress of the united states in the exercise of this power in which the people have no participation congress legislate in all case directly on the local concern of the district as this be a departure for a special purpose from the general principle of our system it may merit consideration whether an arrangement well adapt to the principle of our government and to the particular interest of the people may not be devise which will neither infringe the constitution nor affect the object which the provision in question be intend to secure the grow population already considerable and the increase business of the district which it be believe already interfere with the deliberation of congress on great national concern furnish additional motive for recommend this subject to your consideration when we view the great blessing with which our country have be favor those which we now enjoy and the mean which we possess of hand they down unimpaired to our late posterity our attention be irresistibly draw to the source from whence they flow let we then unite in offer our most grateful acknowledgment for these blessing to the divine author of all good
fellow citizens of the senate and of the house of representatives the public building be advanced to a stage to afford accommodation for congress i offer you my sincere congratulation on the recommencement of your duty in the capitol in bring you to view the incident most deserving attention which have occur since your last session i regret to have to state that several of our principal city have suffer by sickness that an unusual drought have prevail in the middle and western states and that a derangement have be feel in some of our moneyed institution which have proportionably affect their credit i be happy however to have it in my power to assure you that the health of our city be now completely restore that the produce of the year though less abundant than usual will not only be amply sufficient for home consumption but afford a large surplus for the supply of the want of other nation and that the derangement in the circulate paper medium by be leave to those remedy which its obvious cause suggest and the good sense and virtue of our fellow citizen supply have diminish having inform congress on the 27th of february last that a treaty of amity settlement and limit have be conclude in this city between the united states and spain and ratify by the competent authority of the former full confidence be entertain that it would have be ratify by his catholic majesty with equal promptitude and a like earnest desire to terminate on the condition of that treaty the difference which have so long exist between the two country every view which the subject admit of be think to have justify this conclusion great loss have be sustain by citizen of the united states from spanish cruiser more than 20 year before which have not be redress these loss have be acknowledge and provide for by a treaty as far back as the year 1802 which although conclude at madrid be not then ratify by the government of spain nor since until the last year when it be suspend by the late treaty a more satisfactory provision to both party as be presume having be make for they other difference have arise in this long interval affect their high interest which be likewise provide for by this last treaty the treaty itself be form on great consideration and a thorough knowledge of all circumstance the subject matter of every article having be for year under discussion and repeat reference having be make by the minister of spain to his government on the point respect which the great difference of opinion prevail it be form by a minister duly authorize for the purpose who have represent his government in the united states and be employ in this long- protract negotiation several year and who it be not deny keep strictly within the letter of his instruction the faith of spain be therefore pledge under circumstance of peculiar force and solemnity for its ratification on the part of the united states this treaty be evidently accede to in a spirit of conciliation and concession the indemnity for injury and loss so long before sustain and now again acknowledge and provide for be to be pay by they without become a charge on the treasury of spain for territory cede by spain other territory of great value to which our claim be believe to be well found be cede by the united states and in a quarter more interesting to she this cession be nevertheless receive as the mean of indemnify our citizen in a considerable sum the presume amount of their loss other consideration of great weight urge the cession of this territory by spain it be surround by the territories of the united states on every side except on that of the ocean spain have lose her authority over it and fall into the hand of adventurer connect with the savage it be make the mean of uncease annoyance and injury to our union in many of its most essential interest by this cession then spain cede a territory in reality of no value to she and obtain concession of the high importance by the settlement of long- standing difference with the united states affect their respective claim and limit and likewise relieve herself from the obligation of a treaty relate to it which she have fail to fulfill and also from the responsibility incident to the most flagrant and pernicious abuse of her right where she could not support her authority it be know that the treaty be form under these circumstance not a doubt be entertain that his catholic majesty would have ratify it without delay i regret to have to state that this reasonable expectation have be disappoint that the treaty be not ratify within the time stipulate and have not since be ratify as it be important that the nature and character of this unexpected occurrence should be distinctly understand i think it my duty to communicate to you all the fact and circumstance in my possession relate to it anxious to prevent all future disagreement with spain by give the most prompt effect to the treaty which have be thus conclude and particularly by the establishment of a government in florida which should preserve order there the minister of the united states who have be recently appoint to his catholic majesty and to whom the ratification by his government have be commit to be exchange for that of spain be instruct to transmit the latter to the department of state as soon as obtain by a public ship subject to his order for the purpose unexpected delay occur in the ratification by spain he request to be inform of the cause it be state in reply that the great importance of the subject and a desire to obtain explanation on certain point which be not specify have produce the delay and that an envoy would be dispatch to the united states to obtain such explanation of this government the minister of the united states offer to give full explanation on any point on which it might be desire which proposal be decline having communicate this result to the department of state in august last he be instruct notwithstanding the disappointment and surprise which it produce to inform the government of spain that if the treaty should be ratify and transmit here at any time before the meeting of congress it would be receive and have the same effect as if it have be ratify in due time this order be execute the authorized communication be make to the government of spain and by its answer which have just be receive we be officially make acquainted for the first time with the cause which have prevent the ratification of the treaty by his catholic majesty it be allege by the minister of spain that his government have attempt to alter one of the principal article of the treaty by a declaration which the minister of the united states have be order to present when he should deliver the ratification by his government in exchange for that of spain and of which he give notice explanatory of the sense in which that article be understand it be far allege that this government have recently tolerate or protect an expedition from the united states against the province of texas these two imputed act be state as the reason which have induce his catholic majesty to withhold his ratification from the treaty to obtain explanation respect which it be repeat that an envoy would be forthwith dispatch to the united states how far these allegation will justify the conduct of the government of spain will appear on a view of the follow fact and the evidence which support they it will be see by the document transmit herewith that the declaration mention relate to a clause in the 8th article concern certain grant of land recently make by his catholic majesty in florida which it be understand have convey all the land which until then have be ungrante it be the intention of the party to annul these latter grant and that clause be draw for that express purpose and for none other the date of these grant be unknown but it be understand to be posterior to that insert in the article indeed it must be obvious to all that if that provision in the treaty have not the effect of annul these grant it would be altogether nugatory immediately after the treaty be conclude and ratify by this government an intimation be receive that these grant be of anterior date to that fix on by the treaty and that they would not of course be affect by it the mere possibility of such a case so inconsistent with the intention of the party and the meaning of the article induce this government to demand an explanation on the subject which be immediately grant and which correspond with this statement wrt the other act allege that this government have tolerate or protect an expedition against texas it be utterly without foundation every discountenance have invariably be give to any such attempt within the limit of the united states as be fully evince by the act of the government and the proceeding of the court there be cause however to apprehend in the course of the last summer that some adventurer entertain view of the kind suggest the attention of the constituted authority in that quarter be immediately draw to they and it be know that the project whatever it might be have utterly fail these fact will it be presume satisfy every impartial mind that the government of spain have no justifiable cause for decline to ratify the treaty a treaty conclude in conformity with instruction be obligatory in good faith in all its stipulation accord to the true intent and meaning of the party each party be bind to ratify it if either could set it aside without the consent of the other there would be no long any rule applicable to such transaction between nation by this proceed the government of spain have render to the united states a new and very serious injury it have be state that a minister would be send to ask certain explanation of this government but if such be desire why be they not ask within the time limit for the ratification be it contemplate to open a new negotiation respect any of the article or condition of the treaty if that be do to what consequence might it not lead at what time and in what manner would a new negotiation terminate by this proceeding spain have form a relation between the two country which will justify any measure on the part of the united states which a strong sense of injury and a proper regard for the right and interest of the nation may dictate in the course to be pursue these object should be constantly hold in view and have their due weight our national honor must be maintain and a new and a distinguished proof be afford of that regard for justice and moderation which have invariably govern the council of this free people it must be obvious to all that if the united states have be desirous of make conquest or have be even willing to aggrandize themselves in that way they could have have no inducement to form this treaty they would have much cause for gratulation at the course which have be pursue by spain an ample field for ambition be open before they but such a career be not consistent with the principle of their government nor the interest of the nation from a full view of all circumstance it be submit to the consideration of congress whether it will not be proper for the united states to carry the condition of the treaty into effect in the same manner as if it have be ratify by spain claim on their part all its advantage and yield to spain those secure to she by pursue this course we shall rest on the sacred ground of right sanction in the most solemn manner by spain herself by a treaty which she be bind to ratify for refuse to do which she must incur the censure of other nation even those most friendly to she while by confine ourselves within that limit we can not fail to obtain their well merit approbation we must have peace on a frontier where we have be so long disturb our citizen must be indemnify for loss so long since sustain and for which indemnity have be so unjustly withhold from they accomplish these great object we obtain all that be desirable but his catholic majesty have twice declare his determination to send a minister to the united states to ask explanation on certain point and to give they respect his delay to ratify the treaty shall we act by take the cede territory and proceed to execute the other condition of the treaty before this minister arrive and be hear this be a case which form a strong appeal to the candor the magnanimity and the honor of this people much be due to courtesy between nation by a short delay we shall lose nothing for rest on the ground of immutable truth and justice we can not be divert from our purpose it ought to be presume that the explanation which may be give to the minister of spain will be satisfactory and produce the desire result in any event the delay for the purpose mention be a further manifestation of the sincere desire to terminate in the most friendly manner all difference with spain can not fail to be duly appreciate by his catholic majesty as well as by other power it be submit therefore whether it will not be proper to make the law propose for carry the condition of the treaty into effect should it be adopt contingent to suspend its operation upon the responsibility of the executive in such manner as to afford an opportunity for such friendly explanation as may be desire during the present session of congress i communicate to congress a copy of the treaty and of the instruction to the minister of the united states at madrid respect it of his correspondence with the minister of spain and of such other document as may be necessary to give a full view of the subject in the course which the spanish government have on this occasion think proper to pursue it be satisfactory to know that they have not be countenance by any other european power on the contrary the opinion and wish both of france and great britain have not be withhold either from the united states or from spain and have be unequivocal in favor of the ratification there be also reason to believe that the sentiment of the imperial government of russia have be the same and that they have also be make known to the cabinet of madrid in the civil war exist between spain and the spanish provinces in this hemisphere the great care have be take to enforce the law intend to preserve an impartial neutrality our port have continue to be equally open to both party and on the same condition and our citizen have be equally restrain from interfere in favor of either to the prejudice of the other the progress of the war however have operate manifestly in favor of the colony buenos ayres still maintain unshaken the independence which it declare in 1816 and have enjoy since 1810 like success have also lately attend chili and the provinces north of the la plata border on it and likewise venezuela this contest have from its commencement be very interesting to other power and to none more so than to the united states a virtuous people may and will confine themselves within the limit of a strict neutrality but it be not in their power to behold a conflict so vitally important to their neighbor without the sensibility and sympathy which naturally belong to such a case it have be the steady purpose of this government to prevent that feeling lead to excess and it be very gratifying to have it in my power to state that so strong have be the sense throughout the whole community of what be due to the character and obligation of the nation that very few example of a contrary kind have occur the distance of the colony from the parent country and the great extent of their population and resource give they advantage which it be anticipate at a very early period would be difficult for spain to surmount the steadiness consistency and success with which they have pursue their object as evince more particularly by the undisturbed sovereignty which buenos ayres have so long enjoy evidently give they a strong claim to the favorable consideration of other nation these sentiment on the part of the united states have not be withhold from other power with whom it be desirable to act in concert should it become manifest to the world that the effort of spain to subdue these province will be fruitless it may be presume that the spanish government itself will give up the contest in produce such a determination it can not be doubt that the opinion of friendly power who have take no part in the controversy will have their merit influence it be of the high importance to our national character and indispensable to the morality of our citizen that all violation of our neutrality should be prevent no door should be leave open for the evasion of our law no opportunity afford to any who may be dispose to take advantage of it to compromit the interest or the honor of the nation it be submit therefore to the consideration of congress whether it may not be advisable to revise the law with a view to this desirable result it be submit also whether it may not be proper to designate by law the several port or place along the coast at which only foreign ship of war and privateer may be admit the difficulty of sustain the regulation of our commerce and of other important interest from abuse without such designation furnish a strong motive for this measure at the time of the negotiation for the renewal of the commercial convention between the united states and great britain a hope have be entertain that an article might have be agree upon mutually satisfactory to both country regulate upon principle of justice and reciprocity the commercial intercourse between the united states and the british possession as well in the west indies as upon the continent of north america the plenipotentiary of the two government not having be able to come to an agreement on this important interest those of the united states reserve for the consideration of this government the proposal which have be present to they as the ultimate offer on the part of the british government and which they be not authorize to accept on their transmission here they be examine with due deliberation the result of which be a new effort to meet the view of the british government the minister of the united states be instruct to make a further proposal which have not be accept it be however decline in an amicable manner i recommend to the consideration of congress whether further prohibitory provision in the law relate to this intercourse may not be expedient it be see with interest that although it have not be practicable as yet to agree in any arrangement of this important branch of their commerce such be the disposition of the party that each will view any regulation which the other may make respect it in the most friendly light by the 5th article of the convention conclude on 1818 10 20 it be stipulate that the difference which have arise between the two government with respect to the true intent and meaning of the 5th article of the treaty of ghent in relation to the carrying away by british officer of slave from the united states after the exchange of the ratification of the treaty of peace should be refer to the decision of some friendly sovereign or state to be name for that purpose the minister of the united states have be instruct to name to the british government a foreign sovereign the common friend to both party for the decision of this question the answer of that government to the proposal when receive will indicate the further measure to be pursue on the part of the united states although the pecuniary embarrassment which affect various part of the union during the latter part of the precede year have during the present be considerably augmented and still continue to exist the receipt into the treasury to the 30th of september last have amount to $ 19m. after defray the current expense of the government include the interest and reimbursement of the public debt payable to that period amount to $ 18.2 m there remain in the treasury on that day more than $ 2.5 m which with the sum receivable during the remainder of the year will exceed the current demand upon the treasury for the same period the cause which have tend to diminish the public receipt could not fail to have a corresponding effect upon the revenue which have accrue upon impost and tonnage during the three first quarter of the present year it be however ascertain that the duty which have be secure during that period exceed $ 18 m and those of the whole year will probably amount to $ 23m. for the probably receipt of the next year i refer you to the statement which will be transmit from the treasury which will enable you to judge whether further provision be necessary the great reduction in the price of the principal article of domestic growth which have occur during the present year and the consequent fall in the price of labor apparently so favorable to the success of domestic manufacture have not shield they against other cause adverse to their prosperity the pecuniary embarrassment which have so deeply affect the commercial interest of the nation have be no less adverse to our manufacturing establishment in several section of the union the great reduction of the currency which the bank have be constrain to make in order to continue specie payment and the vitiated character of it where such reduction have not be attempt instead of place within the reach of these establishment the pecuniary aid necessary to avail themselves of the advantage result from the reduction in the price of the raw material and of labor have compel the bank to withdraw from they a portion of the capital heretofore advanced to they that aid which have be refuse by the bank have not be obtain from other source owe to the loss of individual confidence from the frequent failure which have recently occur in some of our principal commercial city an additional cause for the depression of these establishment may probably be find in the pecuniary embarrassment which have recently affect those country with which our commerce have be principally prosecute their manufacture for the want of a ready or profitable market at home have be ship by the manufacturer to the united states and in many instance sell at a price below their current value at the place of manufacture although this practice may from its nature be consider temporary or contingent it be not on that account less injurious in its effect uniformity in the demand and price of an article be highly desirable to the domestic manufacturer it be deem of great importance to give encouragement to our domestic manufacturer in what manner the evil which have be advert to may be remedie and how far it may be practicable in other respect to afford to they further encouragement pay due regard to the other great interest of the nation be submit to the wisdom of congress the survey of the coast for the establishment of fortification be now nearly complete and considerable progress have be make in the collection of material for the construction of fortification in the gulf of mexico and in the chesapeake bay the work on the eastern bank of the potomac below alexandria and on the pea patch in the delaware be much advanced and it be expect that the fortification at the narrows in the harbor of ny will be complete the present year to derive all the advantage contemplate from these fortification it be necessary that they should be judiciously post and construct with a view to permanence the progress hitherto have therefore be slow but as the difficulty in part heretofore the least explore and know be surmount it will in future be more rapid as soon as the survey of the coast be complete which it be expect will be do early in the next spring the engineer employ in it will proceed to examine for like purpose the northern and northwestern frontier the troop intend to occupy a station at the mouth of the st. peters on the mississippi have establish themselves there and those who be order to the mouth of the yellow stone on the missouri have ascend that river to the council bluff where they will remain until the next spring when they will proceed to the place of their destination i have the satisfaction to state that this measure have be execute in amity with the indian tribe and that it promise to produce in regard to they all the advantage which be contemplate by it much progress have likewise be make in the construction of ship of war and in the collection of timber and other material for ship building it be not doubt that our navy will soon be augment to the number and place in all respect on the footing provide for by law the board consist of engineer and naval officer have not yet make their final report of site for two naval depot as instruct accord to the resolution of 1818 03 18 and 1818 04 20 but they have examine the coast therein designate and their report be expect in the next month for the protection of our commerce in the mediterranean along the southern atlantic coast in the pacific and indian ocean it have be find necessary to maintain a strong naval force which it seem proper for the present to continue there be much reason to believe that if any portion of the squadron heretofore station in the mediterranean should be withdraw our intercourse with the power border on that sea would be much interrupt if not altogether destroy such too have be the growth of a spirit of piracy in the other quarter mention by adventurer from every country in abuse of the friendly flag which they have assume that not to protect our commerce there would be to abandon it have a prey to their rapacity due attention have likewise be pay to the suppression of the slave trade in compliance with a law of the last session order have be give to the commander of all our public ship to seize all vessel navigate under our flag engage in that trade and to bring they in to be proceed against in the manner prescribe by the law it be hope that these vigorous measure support by like act by other nation will soon terminate a commerce so disgraceful to the civilized world in the execution of the duty impose by these act and of a high trust connect with it it be with deep regret i have to state the loss which have be sustain by the death of commodore perry his gallantry in a brilliant exploit in the late war add to the renown of his country his death be deplore as a national misfortune
fellow citizens of the senate and of the house of representatives in communicating to you a just view of public affair at the commencement of your present labor i do it with great satisfaction because take all circumstance into consideration which claim attention i see much cause to rejoice in the felicity of our situation in make this remark i do not wish to be understand to imply that an unvaried prosperity be to be see in every interest of this great community in the progress of a nation inhabit a territory of such vast extent and great variety of climate every portion of which be engage in foreign commerce and liable to be affect in some degree by the change which occur in the condition and regulation of foreign country it would be strange if the produce of our soil and the industry and enterprise of our fellow citizen receive at all time and in every quarter an uniform and equal encouragement this would be more than we would have a right to expect under circumstance the most favorable pressure on certain interest it be admit have be feel but allow to these their great extent they detract but little from the force of the remark already make in form a just estimate of our present situation it be proper to look at the whole in the outline as well as in the detail a free virtuous and enlighten people know well the great principle and cause on which their happiness depend and even those who suffer most occasionally in their transitory concern find great relief under their suffering from the blessing which they otherwise enjoy and in the console and animate hope which they administer from whence do these pressure come not from a government which be found by administer for and support by the people we trace they to the peculiar character of the epoch in which we live and to the extraordinary occurrence which have signalize it the convulsion with which several of the power of europe have be shake and the long and destructive war in which all be engage with their sudden transition to a state of peace present in the 1st instance unusual encouragement to our commerce and withdraw it in the second even within its wonte limit could not fail to be sensibly feel here the station too which we have to support through this long conflict compel as we be finally to become a party to it with a principal power and to make great exertion suffer heavy loss and to contract considerable debt disturb the ordinary course of affair by augment to a vast amount the circulate medium and thereby elevate at one time the price of every article above a just standard and depress it at another below it have likewise its due effect it be manifest that the pressure of which we complain have proceed in a great measure from these cause when then we take into view the prosperous and happy condition of our country in all the great circumstance which constitute the felicity of a nation every individual in the full enjoyment of all his right the union bless with plenty and rapidly rise to greatness under a national government which operate with complete effect in every part without be feel in any except by the ample protection which it afford and under state government which perform their equal share accord to a wise distribution of power between they in promote the public happiness it be impossible to behold so gratifying so glorious a spectacle without be penetrate with the most profound and grateful acknowledgment to the supreme author of all good for such manifold and inestimable blessing deeply impressed with these sentiment i can not regard the pressure to which i have advert otherwise than in the light of mild and instructive admonition warn we of danger to be shun in future teach we lesson of economy correspond with the simplicity and purity of our institution and well adapt to their support evince the connection and dependence which the various part of our happy union have on each other thereby augment daily our social incorporation and add by its strong tie new strength and vigor to the political open a wide range and with new encouragement to the industry and enterprise of our fellow citizen at home and abroad and more especially by the multiplied proof which it have accumulate of the great perfection of our most excellent system of government the powerful instrument in the hand of our all merciful creator in securing to we these blessing happy as our situation be it do not exempt we from solicitude and care for the future on the contrary as the blessing which we enjoy be great proportionably great should be our vigilance zeal and activity to preserve they foreign war may again expose we to new wrong which would impose on we new duty for which we ought to be prepare the state of europe be unsettled and how long peace may be preserve be altogether uncertain in addition to which we have interest of our own to adjust which will require particular attention a correct view of our relation with each power will enable you to form a just idea of exist difficulty and of the measure of precaution well adapt to they respect our relation with spain nothing explicit can now be communicate on the adjournment of congress in may last the minister plenipotentiary of the united states at madrid be instruct to inform the government of spain that if his catholic majesty should then ratify the treaty this government would accept the ratification so far as to submit to the decision of the senate the question whether such ratification should be receive in exchange for that of the united states heretofore give by letter from the minister of the united states to the secretary of state it appear that a communication in conformity with his instruction have be make to the government of spain and that the cortes have the subject under consideration the result of the deliberation of that body which be daily expect will be make known to congress as soon as it be receive the friendly sentiment which be express on the part of the united states in the message of the 9th of may last be still entertain for spain among the cause of regret however which be inseparable from the delay attend this transaction it be proper to state that satisfactory information have be receive that measure have be recently adopt by design person to convert certain part of the province of east florida into depot for the reception of foreign good from whence to smuggle they into the united states by open a port within the limit of florida immediately on our boundary where there be no settlement the object could not be misunderstood an early accommodation of difference will it be hope prevent all such fraudulent and pernicious practice and place the relation of the two country on a very amicable and permanent basis the commercial relation between the united states and the british colony in the west indies and on this continent have undergo no change the british government still prefer to leave that commerce under the restriction heretofore impose on it on each side it be satisfactory to recollect that the restraint resort to by the united states be defensive only intend to prevent a monopoly under british regulation in favor of great britain as it likewise be to know that the experiment be advance in a spirit of amity between the party the question depend between the united states and great britain respect the construction of the first article of the treaty of ghent have be refer by both government to the decision of the emperor of russia who have accept the umpirage an attempt have be make with the government of france to regulate by treaty the commerce between the two country on the principle of reciprocity and equality by the last communication from the minister plenipotentiary of the united states at paris to whom full power have be give we learn that the negotiation have be commence there but serious difficulty having occur the french government have resolve to transfer it to the united states for which purpose the minister plenipotentiary of france have be order to repair to this city and whose arrival might soon be expect it be hope that this important interest may be arrange on just condition and in a manner equally satisfactory to both party it be submit to congress to decide until such arrangement be make how far it may be proper on the principle of the act of the last session which augment the tonnage duty on french vessel to adopt other measure for carry more completely into effect the policy of that act the act refer to which impose new tonnage on french vessel having be in force from and after the first day of july it have happen that several vessel of that nation which have be dispatch from france before its existence be know have enter the port of the united states and be subject to its operation without that previous notice which the general spirit of our law give to individual in similar case the object of that law having be merely to countervail the inequality which exist to the disadvantage of the united states in their commercial intercourse with france it be submit also to the consideration of congress whether in the spirit of amity and conciliation which it be no less the inclination than the policy of the united states to preserve in their intercourse with other power it may not be proper to extend relief to the individual interested in those case by exempt from the operation of the law all those vessel which have enter our port without having have the mean of previously know the existence of the additional duty the contest between spain and the colony accord to the most authentic information be maintain by the latter with improved success the unfortunate division which be know to exist some time since at buenos ayres it be understand still prevail in no part of south america have spain make any impression on the colony while in many part and particularly in venezuela and new grenada the colony have gain strength and acquire reputation both for the management of the war in which they have be successful and for the order of the internal administration the late change in the government of spain by the reestablishment of the constitution of 1812 be an event which promise to be favorable to the revolution under the authority of the cortes the congress of angostura be invite to open a negotiation for the settlement of difference between the party to which it be reply that they would willingly open the negotiation provide the acknowledgment of their independence be make its basis but not otherwise no fact be know to this government to warrant the belief that any of the power of europe will take part in the contest whence it may be infer consider all circumstance which must have weight in produce the result that an adjustment will finally take place on the basis propose by the colony to promote that result by friendly counsel with other power include spain herself have be the uniform policy of this government in look to the internal concern of our country you will i be persuade derive much satisfaction from a view of the several object to which in the discharge of your official duty your attention will be draw among these none hold a more important place than the public revenue from the direct operation of the power by which it be raise on the people and by its influence in give effect to every other power of the government the revenue depend on the resource of the country and the facility by which the amount require be raise be a strong proof of the extent of the resource and of the efficiency of the government a few prominent fact will place this great interest in a just light before you on 1815 09 30 the funded and float debt of the united states be estimate at $ 119,635,558 if to this sum be add the amount of 5 stock subscribe to the bank of the united states the amount of mississippi stock and of the stock which be issue subsequently to that date and as afterwards liquidate to $ 158,713,049 on 1820 09 30 it amount to $ 91,993,883 having be reduce in that interval by payment $ 66,879,165 during this term the expense of the government of the united states be likewise defray in every branch of the civil military and naval establishment the public edifice in this city have be rebuild with considerable addition extensive fortification have be commence and be in a train of execution permanent arsenal and magazine have be erect in various part of the union our navy have be considerably augment and the ordnance munition of war and store of the army and navy which be much exhausted during the war have be replenish by the discharge of so large a proportion of the public debt and the execution of such extensive and important operation in so short a time a just estimate may be form of the great extent of our national resource the demonstration be the more complete and gratifying when it be recollect that the direct tax and excise be repeal soon after the termination of the late war and that the revenue apply to these purpose have be derive almost wholly from other source the receipt into the treasury from every source to the 30th of september last have amount to $ 16,794,107.66 whilst the public expenditure to the same period amount to $ 16,871,534.72 leave in the treasury on that day a sum estimate at $ 1.95m. for the probable receipt of the follow year i refer you to the statement which will be transmit from the treasury the sum of $ 3 m authorize to be raise by loan by an act of the last session of congress have be obtain upon term advantageous to the government indicate not only an increase confidence in the faith of the nation but the existence of a large amount of capital seek that mode of investment at a rate of interest not exceed 5 per annum it be proper to add that there be now due to the treasury for the sale of public land $ 22,996,545 in bring this subject to view i consider it my duty to submit to congress whether it may not be advisable to extend to the purchaser of these land in consideration of the unfavorable change which have occur since the sale a reasonable indulgence it be know that the purchase be make when the price of every article have rise to its great height and the installment be become due at a period of great depression it be presume that some plan may be devise by the wisdom of congress compatible with the public interest which would afford great relief to these purchaser considerable progress have be make during the present season in examine the coast and its various bay and other inlet in the collection of material and in the construction of fortification for the defense of the union at several of the position at which it have be decide to erect such work at mobile point and dauphin island and at the rigolets lead to lake pontchartrain material to a considerable amount have be collect and all the necessary preparation make for the commencement of the work at old point comfort at the mouth of the james river and at the rip rap on the opposite shore in the chesapeake bay material to a vast amount have be collect and at the old point some progress have be make in the construction of the fortification which be on a very extensive scale the work at fort washington on this river will be complete early in the next spring and that on the pea patch in the delaware in the course of the next season fort diamond at the narrows in the harbor of ny will be finish this year the work at boston ny baltimore norfolk charleston and niagara have be in part repair and the coast of nc extend south to cape fear have be examine as have likewise other part of the coast eastward of boston great exertion have be make to push forward these work with the utmost dispatch possible but when their extent be consider with the important purpose for which they be intend the defense of the whole coast and in consequence of the whole interior and that they be to last for age it will be manifest that a well- digest plan found on military principle connect the whole together combine security with economy could not be prepare without repeat examination of the most exposed and difficult part and that it would also take considerable time to collect the material at the several point where they would be require from all the light that have be shed on this subject i be satisfied that every favorable anticipation which have be form of this great undertaking will be verify and that when complete it will afford very great if not complete protection to our atlantic frontier in the event of another war protection sufficient to counterbalance in a single campaign with an enemy powerful at sea the expense of all these work without take into the estimate the saving of the life of so many of our citizen the protection of our town and other property or the tendency of such work to prevent war our military position have be maintain at belle point on the arkansas at council bluffs on the missouri at st. peters on the mississippi and at green bay on the upper lakes commodious barrack have already be erect at most of these post with such work as be necessary for their defense progress have also be make in opening communication between they and in raise supply at each for the support of the troop by their own labor particularly those most remote with the indians peace have be preserve and a progress make in carry into effect the act of congress make an appropriation for their civilization with the prospect of favorable result as connect equally with both these object our trade with those tribe be think to merit the attention of congress in their original state game be their sustenance and war their occupation and if they find no employment from civilized power they destroy each other leave to themselves their extirpation be inevitable by a judicious regulation of our trade with they we supply their want administer to their comfort and gradually as the game retire draw they to we by maintain post far in the interior we acquire a more thorough and direct control over they without which it be confidently believe that a complete change in their manner can never be accomplish by such post aid by a proper regulation of our trade with they and a judicious civil administration over they to be provide for by law we shall it be presume be enable not only to protect our own settlement from their savage incursion and preserve peace among the several tribe but accomplish also the great purpose of their civilization considerable progress have also be make in the construction of ship of war some of which have be launch in the course of the present year our peace with the power on the coast of barbary have be preserve but we owe it altogether to the presence of our squadron in the mediterranean it have be find equally necessary to employ some of our vessel for the protection of our commerce in the indian sea the pacific and along the atlantic coast the interest which we have depend in those quarter which have be much improve of late be of great extent and of high importance to the nation as well as to the party concern and would undoubtedly suffer if such protection be not extend to they in execution of the law of the last session for the suppression of the slave trade some of our public ship have also be employ on the coast of africa where several capture have already be make of vessel engage in that disgraceful traffic
fellow citizen i shall not attempt to describe the grateful emotion which the new and very distinguished proof of the confidence of my fellow citizen evince by my reelection to this high trust have excite in my bosom the approbation which it announce of my conduct in the precede term afford i a consolation which i shall profoundly feel through life the general accord with which it have be express add to the great and never cease obligation which it impose to merit the continuance of this good opinion and to carry it with i into my retirement as the solace of advance year will be the object of my most zealous and uncease effort   have no pretension to the high and commanding claim of my predecessor whose name be so much more conspicuously identify with our revolution and who contribute so preeminently to promote its success i consider myself rather as the instrument than the cause of the union which have prevail in the late election in surmount in favor of my humble pretension the difficulty which so often produce division in like occurrence it be obvious that other powerful cause indicate the great strength and stability of our union have essentially contribute to draw you together that these powerful cause exist and that they be permanent be my fix opinion that they may produce a like accord in all question touch however remotely the liberty prosperity and happiness of our country will always be the object of my most fervent prayer to the supreme author of all good in a government which be found by the people who possess exclusively the sovereignty it seem proper that the person who may be place by their suffrage in this high trust should declare on commence its duty the principle on which he intend to conduct the administration if the person thus elect have serve the precede term an opportunity be afford he to review its principal occurrence and to give such further explanation respect they as in his judgment may be useful to his constituent the event of one year have influence on those of another and in like manner of a precede on the succeed administration the movement of a great nation be connect in all their part if error have be commit they ought to be correct if the policy be sound it ought to be support it be by a thorough knowledge of the whole subject that our fellow citizen be enable to judge correctly of the past and to give a proper direction to the future just before the commencement of the last term the united states have conclude a war with a very powerful nation on condition equal and honorable to both party the event of that war be too recent and too deeply impressed on the memory of all to require a development from i our commerce have be in a great measure drive from the sea our atlantic and inland frontier be invade in almost every part the waste of life along our coast and on some part of our inland frontier to the defense of which our gallant and patriotic citizen be call be immense in addition to which not less than $ 120,000,000 be add at its end to the public debt as soon as the war have terminate the nation admonish by its event resolve to place itself in a situation which should be well calculate to prevent the recurrence of a like evil and in case it should recur to mitigate its calamity with this view after reduce our land force to the basis of a peace establishment which have be far modify since provision be make for the construction of fortification at proper point through the whole extent of our coast and such an augmentation of our naval force as should be well adapt to both purpose the law make this provision be pass in 1815 and 1816 and it have be since the constant effort of the executive to carry they into effect the advantage of these fortification and of an augmented naval force in the extent contemplate in a point of economy have be fully illustrate by a report of the board of engineers and naval commissioners lately communicate to congress by which it appear that in an invasion by 20,000 man with a correspondent naval force in a campaign of six month only the whole expense of the construction of the work would be defray by the difference in the sum necessary to maintain the force which would be adequate to our defense with the aid of those work and that which would be incur without they the reason of this difference be obvious if fortification be judiciously place on our great inlet as distant from our city as circumstance will permit they will form the only point of attack and the enemy will be detain there by a small regular force a sufficient time to enable our militia to collect and repair to that on which the attack be make a force adequate to the enemy collect at that single point with suitable preparation for such other as might be menace be all that would be requisite but if there be no fortification then the enemy might go where he please and change his position and sailing from place to place our force must be call out and spread in vast number along the whole coast and on both side of every bay and river as high up in each as it might be navigable for ship of war by these fortification support by our navy to which they would afford like support we should present to other power an armed front from st. croix to the sabine which would protect in the event of war our whole coast and interior from invasion and even in the war of other power in which we be neutral they would be find eminently useful as by keep their public ship at a distance from our city peace and order in they would be preserve and the government be protect from insult it need scarcely be remark that these measure have not be resort to in a spirit of hostility to other power such a disposition do not exist toward any power peace and good will have be and will hereafter be cultivate with all and by the most faithful regard to justice they have be dictate by a love of peace of economy and an earnest desire to save the life of our fellow citizen from that destruction and our country from that devastation which be inseparable from war when it find we unprepared for it it be believe and experience have show that such a preparation be the good expedient that can be resort to prevent war i add with much pleasure that considerable progress have already be make in these measure of defense and that they will be complete in a few year consider the great extent and importance of the object if the plan be zealously and steadily persevere in the conduct of the government in what relate to foreign power be always an object of the high importance to the nation its agriculture commerce manufacture fishery revenue in short its peace may all be affect by it attention be therefore due to this subject at the period advert to the power of europe after having be engage in long and destructive war with each other have conclude a peace which happily still exist our peace with the power with whom we have be engage have also be conclude the war between spain and the colony in south america which have commence many year before be then the only conflict that remain unsettled this be a contest between different part of the same community in which other power have not interfere be not affect by their accommodation this contest be consider at an early stage by my predecessor a civil war in which the party be entitle to equal right in our port this decision the first make by any power be form on great consideration of the comparative strength and resource of the party the length of time and successful opposition make by the colony and of all other circumstance on which it ought to depend be in strict accord with the law of nation congress have invariably act on this principle having make no change in our relation with either party our attitude have therefore be that of neutrality between they which have be maintain by the government with the strict impartiality no aid have be afford to either nor have any privilege be enjoy by the one which have not be equally open to the other party and every exertion have be make in its power to enforce the execution of the law prohibit illegal equipment with equal rigor against both by this equality between the party their public vessel have be receive in our port on the same footing they have enjoy an equal right to purchase and export arm munition of war and every other supply the exportation of all article whatever be permit under law which be pass long before the commencement of the contest our citizen have trade equally with both and their commerce with each have be alike protect by the government respect the attitude which it may be proper for the united states to maintain hereafter between the party i have no hesitation in state it as my opinion that the neutrality heretofore observe should still be adhere to from the change in the government of spain and the negotiation now depend invite by the cortes and accept by the colony it may be presume that their difference will be settle on the term propose by the colony should the war be continue the united states regard its occurrence will always have it in their power to adopt such measure respect it as their honor and interest may require shortly after the general peace a band of adventurer take advantage of this conflict and of the facility which it afford to establish a system of buccaneer in the neighboring sea to the great annoyance of the commerce of the united states and as be represent of that of other power of this spirit and of its injurious bearing on the united states strong proof be afford by the establishment at amelia island and the purpose to which it be make instrumental by this band in 1817 and by the occurrence which take place in other part of florida in 1818 the detail of which in both instance be too well known to require to be now recite i be satisfied have a less decisive course be adopt that the bad consequence would have result from it we have see that these check decisive as they be be not sufficient to crush that piratical spirit many culprit bring within our limit have be condemn to suffer death the punishment due to that atrocious crime the decision of upright and enlighten tribunal fall equally on all whose crime subject they by a fair interpretation of the law to its censure it belong to the executive not to suffer the execution under these decision to transcend the great purpose for which punishment be necessary the full benefit of example be secure policy as well as humanity equally forbid that they should be carry far i have act on this principle pardon those who appear to have be lead astray by ignorance of the criminality of the act they have commit and suffer the law to take effect on those only in whose favor no extenuating circumstance could be urge great confidence be entertain that the late treaty with spain which have be ratify by both the party and the ratification whereof have be exchange have place the relation of the two country on a basis of permanent friendship the provision make by it for such of our citizen as have claim on spain of the character describe will it be presume be very satisfactory to they and the boundary which be establish between the territory of the party westward of the mississippi heretofore in dispute have it be think be settle on condition just and advantageous to both but to the acquisition of florida too much importance can not be attach it secure to the united states a territory important in itself and whose importance be much increase by its bearing on many of the high interest of the union it open to several of the neighbor states a free passage to the ocean through the province cede by several river have their source high up within their limit it secure we against all future annoyance from powerful indian tribe it give we several excellent harbor in the gulf of mexico for ship of war of the large size it cover by its position in the gulf the mississippi and other great water within our extended limit and thereby enable the united states to afford complete protection to the vast and very valuable production of our whole western country which find a market through those stream by a treaty with the british government bear date on the 20th of october 1818 the convention regulate the commerce between the united states and great britain conclude on the 3d of july 1815 which be about expiring be revive and continue for the term of ten year from the time of its expiration by that treaty also the difference which have arise under the treaty of ghent respect the right claim by the united states for their citizen to take and cure fish on the coast of his britannic majesty 's dominion in america with other difference on important interest be adjust to the satisfaction of both party no agreement have yet be enter into respect the commerce between the united states and the british dominion in the west indies and on this continent the restraint impose on that commerce by great britain and reciprocate by the united states on a principle of defense continue still in force the negotiation with france for the regulation of the commercial relation between the two country which in the course of the last summer have be commence at paris have since be transfer to this city and will be pursue on the part of the united states in the spirit of conciliation and with an earnest desire that it may terminate in an arrangement satisfactory to both party our relation with the barbary powers be preserve in the same state and by the same mean that be employ when i come into this office as early as 1801 it be find necessary to send a squadron into the mediterranean for the protection of our commerce and no period have intervene a short term except when it be think advisable to withdraw it the great interest which the united states have in the pacific in commerce and in the fishery have also make it necessary to maintain a naval force there in dispose of this force in both instance the most effectual measure in our power have be take without interfere with its other duty for the suppression of the slave trade and of piracy in the neighboring sea the situation of the united states in regard to their resource the extent of their revenue and the facility with which it be raise afford a most gratifying spectacle the payment of nearly $ 67,000,000 of the public debt with the great progress make in measure of defense and in other improvement of various kind since the late war be conclusive proof of this extraordinary prosperity especially when it be recollect that these expenditure have be defray without a burthen on the people the direct tax and excise having be repeal soon after the conclusion of the late war and the revenue apply to these great object having be raise in a manner not to be feel our great resource therefore remain untouched for any purpose which may affect the vital interest of the nation for all such purpose they be inexhaustible they be more especially to be find in the virtue patriotism and intelligence of our fellow citizen and in the devotion with which they would yield up by any just measure of taxation all their property in support of the right and honor of their country under the present depression of price affect all the production of the country and every branch of industry proceed from cause explain on a former occasion the revenue have considerably diminish the effect of which have be to compel congress either to abandon these great measure of defense or to resort to loan or internal taxis to supply the deficiency on the presumption that this depression and the deficiency in the revenue arise from it would be temporary loan be authorize for the demand of the last and present year anxious to relieve my fellow citizen in 1817 from every burthen which could be dispense with and the state of the treasury permit it i recommend the repeal of the internal taxis know that such relief be then peculiarly necessary in consequence of the great exertion make in the late war i make that recommendation under a pledge that should the public exigency require a recurrence to they at any time while i remain in this trust i would with equal promptitude perform the duty which would then be alike incumbent on i by the experiment now make it will be see by the next session of congress whether the revenue shall have be so augmented as to be adequate to all these necessary purpose should the deficiency still continue and especially should it be probable that it would be permanent the course to be pursue appear to i to be obvious i be satisfied that under certain circumstance loan may be resort to with great advantage i be equally well satisfied as a general rule that the demand of the current year especially in time of peace should be provide for by the revenue of that year i have never dread nor have i ever shun in any situation in which i have be place make appeal to the virtue and patriotism of my fellow citizen well know that they could never be make in vain especially in time of great emergency or for purpose of high national importance independently of the exigency of the case many consideration of great weight urge a policy have in view a provision of revenue to meet to a certain extent the demand of the nation without rely altogether on the precarious resource of foreign commerce i be satisfied that internal duty and excise with corresponding impost on foreign article of the same kind would without impose any serious burden on the people enhance the price of produce promote our manufacture and augment the revenue at the same time that they make it more secure and permanent the care of the indian tribe within our limit have long be an essential part of our system but unfortunately it have not be execute in a manner to accomplish all the object intend by it we have treat they as independent nation without their have any substantial pretension to that rank the distinction have flatter their pride retard their improvement and in many instance pave the way to their destruction the progress of our settlement westward support as they be by a dense population have constantly drive they back with almost the total sacrifice of the land which they have be compel to abandon they have claim on the magnanimity and i may add on the justice of this nation which we must all feel we should become their real benefactor we should perform the office of their great father the endearing title which they emphatically give to the chief magistrate of our union their sovereignty over vast territory should cease in lieu of which the right of soil should be secure to each individual and his posterity in competent portion and for the territory thus cede by each tribe some reasonable equivalent should be grant to be vest in permanent fund for the support of civil government over they and for the education of their child for their instruction in the art of husbandry and to provide sustenance for they until they could provide it for themselves my earnest hope be that congress will digest some plan found on these principle with such improvement as their wisdom may suggest and carry it into effect as soon as it may be practicable europe be again unsettled and the prospect of war increase should the flame light up in any quarter how far it may extend it be impossible to foresee it be our peculiar felicity to be altogether unconnected with the cause which produce this menacing aspect elsewhere with every power we be in perfect amity and it be our interest to remain so if it be practicable on just condition i see no reasonable cause to apprehend variance with any power unless it proceed from a violation of our maritime right in these contest should they occur and to whatever extent they may be carry we shall be neutral but as a neutral power we have right which it be our duty to maintain for like injury it will be incumbent on we to seek redress in a spirit of amity in full confidence that injure none none would knowingly injure we for more imminent danger we should be prepare and it should always be recollect that such preparation adapt to the circumstance and sanction by the judgment and wish of our constituent can not fail to have a good effect in avert danger of every kind we should recollect also that the season of peace be well adapt to these preparation if we turn our attention fellow citizen more immediately to the internal concern of our country and more especially to those on which its future welfare depend we have every reason to anticipate the happy result it be now rather more than forty four year since we declare our independence and thirty seven since it be acknowledge the talent and virtue which be display in that great struggle be a sure presage of all that have since follow a people who be able to surmount in their infant state such great peril would be more competent as they rise into manhood to repel any which they might meet in their progress their physical strength would be more adequate to foreign danger and the practice of self government aid by the light of experience could not fail to produce an effect equally salutary on all those question connect with the internal organization these favorable anticipation have be realize in our whole system national and state we have shun all the defect which unceasingly prey on the vital and destroy the ancient republic in they there be distinct order a nobility and a people or the people govern in one assembly thus in the one instance there be a perpetual conflict between the order in society for the ascendency in which the victory of either terminate in the overthrow of the government and the ruin of the state in the other in which the people govern in a body and whose dominion seldom exceed the dimension of a county in one of our states a tumultuous and disorderly movement permit only a transitory existence in this great nation there be but one order that of the people whose power by a peculiarly happy improvement of the representative principle be transfer from they without impair in the slight degree their sovereignty to body of their own creation and to person elect by themselves in the full extent necessary for all the purpose of free enlightened and efficient government the whole system be elective the complete sovereignty be in the people and every officer in every department derive his authority from and be responsible to they for his conduct our career have correspond with this great outline perfection in our organization could not have be expect in the outset either in the national or state governments or in trace the line between their respective power but no serious conflict have arise nor any contest but such as be manage by argument and by a fair appeal to the good sense of the people and many of the defect which experience have clearly demonstrate in both government have be remedie by steadily pursue this course in this spirit there be every reason to believe that our system will soon attain the high degree of perfection of which human institution be capable and that the movement in all its branch will exhibit such a degree of order and harmony as to command the admiration and respect of the civilized world our physical attainment have not be less eminent twenty five year ago the river mississippi be shut up and our western brother have no outlet for their commerce what have be the progress since that time the river have not only become the property of the united states from its source to the ocean with all its tributary stream with the exception of the upper part of the red river only but louisiana with a fair and liberal boundary on the western side and the floridas on the eastern have be cede to we the united states now enjoy the complete and uninterrupted sovereignty over the whole territory from st. croix to the sabine new states settle from among ourselves in this and in other part have be admit into our union in equal participation in the national sovereignty with the original state our population have augment in an astonishing degree and extend in every direction we now fellow citizen comprise within our limit the dimension and faculty of a great power under a government possess all the energy of any government ever know to the old world with an utter incapacity to oppress the people enter with these view the office which i have just solemnly swear to execute with fidelity and to the utmost of my ability i derive great satisfaction from a knowledge that i shall be assist in the several departments by the very enlightened and upright citizen from whom i have receive so much aid in the precede term with full confidence in the continuance of that candor and generous indulgence from my fellow citizen at large which i have heretofore experience and with a firm reliance on the protection of almighty god i shall forthwith commence the duty of the high trust to which you have call i

fellow citizens of the senate and of the house of representatives the progress of our affair since the last session have be such as may justly be claim and expect under a government derive all its power from an enlightened people and under law form by their representative on great consideration for the sole purpose of promote the welfare and happiness of their constituent in the execution of those law and of the power vest by the constitution in the executive unremitted attention have be pay to the great object to which they extend in the concern which be exclusively internal there be good cause to be satisfied with the result the law have have their due operation and effect in those relate to foreign power i be happy to state that peace and amity be preserve with all by a strict observance on both side of the right of each in matter touch our commercial intercourse where a difference of opinion have exist as to the condition on which it should be place each party have pursue its own policy without give just cause of offense to the other in this annual communication especially when it be address to a new congress the whole scope of our political concern naturally come into view that error if such have be commit may be correct that defect which have become manifest may be remedie and on the other hand that measure which be adopt on due deliberation and which experience have shewn be just in themselves and essential to the public welfare should be persevere in and support in perform this necessary and very important duty i shall endeavor to place before you on its merit every subject that be think to be entitle to your particular attention in as distinct and clear a light as i may be able by an act of 1815 03 03 so much of the several act as impose high duty on the tonnage of foreign vessel and on the manufacture and production of foreign nation when import into the united states in foreign vessel than when import in vessel of the united states be repeal so far as respect the manufacture and production of the nation to which such vessel belong on the condition that the repeal should take effect only in favor of any foreign nation when the executive should be satisfied that such discriminating duty to the disadvantage of the united states have likewise be repeal by such nation by this act a proposition be make to all nation to place our commerce with each on a basis which it be presume would be acceptable to all every nation be allow to bring its manufacture and production into our port and to take the manufacture and production of the united states back to their port in their own vessel on the same condition that they might be transport in vessel of the united states and in return it be require that a like accommodation should be grant to the vessel of the united states in the port of other power the article to be admit or prohibit on either side form no part of the propose arrangement each party would retain the right to admit or prohibit such article from the other as it think proper and on its own condition when the nature of the commerce between the united states and every other country be take into view it be think that this proposition would be consider fair and even liberal by every power the export of the united states consist generally of article of the 1st necessity and of rude material in demand for foreign manufactory of great bulk require for their transportation many vessel the return for which in the manufacture and production of any foreign country even when dispose of there to advantage may be bring in a single vessel this observation be the more especially applicable to those country from which manufacture alone be import but it apply in great extent to the european dominion of every european power and in a certain extent to all the colony of those power by placing then the navigation precisely on the same ground in the transportation of export and import between the united states and other country it be presume that all be offer which could be desire it seem to be the only proposition which could be devise which would retain even the semblance of equality in our favor many consideration of great weight give we a right to expect that this commerce should be extend to the colony as well as to the european dominion of other power with the latter especially with country exclusively manufacture the advantage be manifestly on their side an indemnity for that loss be expect from a trade with the colony and with the great reason as it be know that the supply which the colony derive from we be of the high importance to they their labor be bestow with so much great profit in the culture of other article and because likewise the article of which those supply consist form so large a proportion of the export of the united states be never admit into any of the port of europe except in case of great emergency to avert a serious calamity when no article be admit which be not require to supply the want of the party admit it and admit then not in favor of any particular country to the disadvantage of other but on condition equally applicable to all it seem just that the article thus admit and invite should be carry thither in the vessel of the country afford such supply and that the reciprocity should be find in a corresponding accommodation on the other side by allow each party to participate in the transportation of such supply on the payment of equal tonnage a strong proof be afford of an accommodate spirit to abandon to it the transportation of the whole would be a sacrifice which ought not to be expect the demand in the present instance would be the more unreasonable in consideration of the great inequality exist in the trade with the parent country such be the basis of our system as establish by the act of 1815 and such its true character in the year in which this act be pass a treaty be conclude with great britain in strict conformity with its principle in regard to her european dominion to her colony however in the west indies and on this continent it be not extend the british government claim the exclusive supply of those colony and from our own port and of the production of the colony in return in her own vessel to this claim the united states could not assent and in consequence each party suspend the intercourse in the vessel of the other by a prohibition which still exist the same condition be offer to france but not accept her government have demand other condition more favorable to her navigation and which should also give extraordinary encouragement to her manufacture and production in port of the united states to these it be think improper to accede and in consequence the restrictive regulation which have be adopt on her part be countervail on the part of the united states the direct commerce between the 2 country in the vessel of each party have be in great measure suspend it be much to be regret that although a negotiation have be long pende such be the diversity of view entertain on the various point which have be bring into discussion that there do not appear to be any reasonable prospect of its early conclusion it be my duty to state as a cause of very great regret that very serious difference have occur in this negotiation respect the construction of the 8th article of the treaty of 1803 by which louisiana be cede to the united states and likewise respect the seizure of the apollo in 1820 for a violation of our revenue law the claim of the government of france have excite not less surprise than concern because there do not appear to be a just foundation for it in either instance by the 8th article of the treaty refer to it be stipulate that after the expiration of 12 year during which time it be provide by the 7th or precede article that the vessel of france and spain should be admit into the port of the cede territory without pay high duty on merchandise or tonnage on the vessel than such as be pay by citizen of the united states the ship of france should forever afterwards be place on the footing of the most favored nation by the obvious construction of this article it be presume that it be intend that no favor should be grant to any power in those port to which france should not be forthwith entitle nor should any accommodation be allow to another power on condition to which she would not also be entitle on the same condition under this construction no favor or accommodation could be grant to any power to the prejudice of france by allow the equivalent allow by those power she would always stand in those port on the footing of the most favored nation but if this article should be so construed as that france should enjoy of right and without pay the equivalent all the advantage of such condition as might be allow to other power in return for important concession make by they then the whole character of the stipulation would be change she would not be place on the footing of the most favored nation but on a footing hold by no other nation she would enjoy all advantage allow to they in consideration of like advantage allow to we free from every and any condition whatever as little cause have the government of france to complain of the seizure of the apollo and the removal of other vessel from the water of the st. marys it will not be deny that every nation have a right to regulate its commercial system as it think fit and to enforce the collection of its revenue provide it be do without an invasion of the right of other power the violation of its revenue law be an offense which all nation punish the punishment of which give no just cause of complaint to the power to which the offender belong provide it be extend to all equally in this case every circumstance which occur indicate a fix purpose to violate our revenue law have the party intend to have pursue a fair trade he would have enter the port of some other power land his good at the custom house accord to law and re ship and send they in the vessel of such power or of some other power which might lawfully bring they free from such duty to a port of the united states but the conduct of the party in this case be altogether different he enter the river st. marys the boundary line between the united states and florida and take his position on the spanish side on which in the whole extent of the river there be no town no port or custom house and scarcely any settlement his purpose therefore be not to sell his good to the inhabitant of florida but to citizen of the united states in exchange for their production which could not be do without a direct and palpable breach of our law it be know that a regular systematic plan have be form by certain person for the violation of our revenue system which make it the more necessary to check the proceeding in its commencement that the unsettled bank of a river so remote from the spanish garrison and population could give no protection to any party in such a practice be believe to be in strict accord with the law of nation it would not have comport with a friendly policy in spain herself to have establish a custom house there since it could have subserve no other purpose than to elude our revenue law but the government of spain do not adopt that measure on the contrary it be understand that the captain general of cuba to whom an application to that effect be make by these adventurer have not accede to it the condition of those province for many year before they be cede to the united states need not now be dwelt on inhabit by different tribe of indians and an inroad for every kind of adventurer the jurisdiction of spain may be say to have be almost exclusively confine to her garrison it certainly could not extend to place where she have no authority the rule therefore applicable to settle country govern by law could not be deem so to the desert of florida and to the occurrence there it merit attention also that the territory have be cede to the united states by a treaty the ratification of which have not be refuse and which have since be perform under any circumstance therefore spain become less responsible for such act commit there and the united states more at liberty to exercise authority to prevent so great a mischief the conduct of this government have in every instance be conciliatory and friendly to france the construction of our revenue law in its application to the case which have form the ground of such serious complaint on her part and the order to the collector of st. marys in accord with it be give two year before these case occur and in reference to a breach which be attempt by the subject of another power the application therefore to the case in question be inevitable as soon as the treaty by which these province be cede to the united states be ratify and all danger of further breach of our revenue law cease an order be give for the release of the vessel which have be seize and for the dismission of the libel which have be institute against she the principle of this system of reciprocity found on the law of 1815 03 03 have be since carry into effect with the kingdoms of the netherlands sweden prussia and with hamburg lubeck and oldenburg with a provision make by subsequent law in regard to the netherlands prussia hamburg and bremen that such produce and manufacture as could only be or most usually be 1st ship from the port of those country the same be import in vessel wholly belong to their subject should be consider and admit as their own manufacture and production the government of norway have by an ordinance open the port of that part of the dominion of the king of sweden to the vessel of the united states upon the payment of no other or high duty than be pay by norwegian vessel from whatever place arrive and with whatever article laden they have request the reciprocal allowance for the vessel of norway in the port of the united states as this privilege be not within the scope of the act of 1815 03 03 and can only be grant by congress and as it may involve the commercial relation of the united states with other nation the subject be submit to the wisdom of congress i have present thus fully to your view our commercial relation with other power that see they in detail with each power and know the basis on which they rest congress may in its wisdom decide whether any change ought to be make and if any in what respect if this basis be unjust or unreasonable surely it ought to be abandon but if it be just and reasonable and any change in it will make concession subversive of equality and tend in its consequence to sap the foundation of our prosperity then the reason be equally strong for adhere to the ground already take and support it by such further regulation as may appear to be proper should any additional support be find necessary the question concern the construction of the first article of the treaty of ghent have be by a joint act of the representative of the united states and of great britain at the court of st. petersburg submit to the decision of his imperial majesty the emperor of russia the result of that submission have not yet be receive the commissioner under the 5th article of that treaty not having be able to agree upon their decision their report to the two government accord to the provision of the treaty may be expect at an early day with spain the treaty of 1819 02 22 have be partly carry into execution possession of e and w fl have be give to the united states but the officer charge with that service by an order from his catholic majesty deliver by his minister to the sec of state and transmit by a special agent to the captain general of cuba to whom it be direct and in whom the government of those provinces be vest have not only omit in contravention of the order of their sovereign the performance of the express stipulation to deliver over the archive and document relate to the property and sovereignty of those provinces all of which it be expect would have be deliver either before or when the troop be withdraw but defeat since every effort of the united states to obtain they especially those of the great importance this omission have give rise to several incident of a painful nature the character of which will be fully disclose by the document which will be hereafter communicate in every other circumstance of the law of the 3rd of march last for carry into effect that treaty have be duly attend to for the execution of that part which preserve in force for the government of the inhabitant for the term specify all the civil military and judicial power exercise by the exist government of those province an adequate of officer as be presume be appoint and order to their respective station both provinces be form into 1 territory and a governor appoint for it but in consideration of the pre existing division and of the distance and difficulty of communication between pensacola the residence of the governor of west florida and st. augustine that of the governor of east florida at which place the inconsiderable population of each province be principally collect two secretary be appoint the one to reside at pensacola and the other at st. augustine due attention be likewise pay to the execution of the law of the united states relate to the revenue and the slave trade which be extend to these provinces the whole territory be divide into three collection district that part lie between the river st. marys and cape florida form one that from the cape to the apalachicola another and that from the apalachicola to the perdido the third to these district the usual number of revenue officer be appoint and to secure the due operation of these law one judge and a district attorney be appoint to reside at pensacola and likewise one judge and a district attorney to reside at st. augustine with a specify boundary between they and one marshal for the whole with authority to appoint a deputy in carry this law into effect and especially that part relate to the power of the exist government of those provinces it be think important in consideration of the short term for which it be to operate and the radical change which would be make at the approach session of congress to avoid expense to make no appointment which should not be absolutely necessary to give effect to those power to withdraw none of our citizen from their pursuit whereby to subject the government to claim which could not be gratify and the party to loss which it would be painful to witness it have be see with much concern that in the performance of these duty a collision arise between the governor of the territory and the judge appoint for the western district it be presume that the law under which this transitory government be organize and the commission which be grant to the officer who be appoint to execute each branch of the system and to which the commission be adapt would have be understand in the same sense by they in which they be understand by the executive much allowance be due to officer employ in each branch of this system and the more so as there be good cause to believe that each act under the conviction that he possess the power which he undertake to exercise of the officer hold the principal station i think it proper to observe that he accept it with reluctance in compliance with the invitation give he and from a high sense of duty to his country be willing to contribute to the consummation of an event which would insure complete protection to an important part of our union which have suffer much from incursion and invasion and to the defense of which his very gallant and patriotic service have be so signally and usefully devoted from the intrinsic difficulty of execute law derive their origin from different source and so essentially different in many important circumstance the advantage and indeed the necessity of establish as soon as practicable a well organize government over that territory on the principle of our system be apparent this subject be therefore recommend to the early consideration of congress in compliance with an injunction of the law of the 3rd of march last three commissioner have also be appoint and a board organize for carry into effect the 11th article of the treaty above recite make provision for the payment of such of our citizen as have well found claim on spain of the character specify by that treaty this board have enter on its duty and make some progress therein the commissioner and surveyor of his catholic majesty provide for by the 4th article of the treaty have not yet arrive in the united states but be soon expect as soon as they do arrive correspond appointment will be make and every facility be afford for the due execution of this service the government of his most faithful majesty since the termination of the last session of congress have be remove from rio de janeiro to lisbon where a revolution similar to that which have occur in the neighboring kingdom of spain have in like manner be sanction by the accept and pledge faith of the reign monarch the diplomatic intercourse between the united states and the portuguese dominion interrupt by this important event have not yet be resume but the change of internal administration having already materially affect the commercial intercourse of the united states with the portuguese dominion the renewal of the public mission between the two country appear to be desirable at an early day it be understand that the colony in south america have have great success during the present year in the struggle for their independence the new government of colombia have extend its territory and considerably augment its strength and at buenos ayres where civil dissension have for some time before prevail great harmony and well order appear to have be establish equal success have attend their effort in the provinces on the pacific it have long be manifest that it would be impossible for spain to reduce these colony by force and equally so that no condition short of their independence would be satisfactory to they it may therefore be presume and it be earnestly hope that the government of spain guide by enlightened and liberal council will find it to comport with its interest and due to its magnanimity to terminate this exhausting controversy on that basis to promote this result by friendly counsel with the government of spain will be the object of the government of the united states in conduct the fiscal operation of the year it have be find necessary to carry into full effect the act of the last session of congress authorize a loan of $ 5m. this sum have be raise at an average premium of $ 5.59 per centum upon stock bear an interest at the rate of 5 per annum redeemable at the option of the government after 1835 01 01 there have be issue under the provision of this act $ 4,735,296.30 of 5 stock and there have be or will be redeem during the year $ 3,197,030.71 of louisiana 6 defer stock and mississippi stock there have therefore be an actual increase of the public debt contract during the year of $ 1,538,266.69 the receipt into the treasury from the first of january to the 30th of september last have amount to $ 16,219,197.70 which with the balance of $ 1,198,461.21 in the treasury on the former day make the aggregate sum of $ 17,417,658.91 the payment from the treasury during the same period have amount to $ 15,655,288.47 leave in the treasury on the last mention day the sum of $ 1,762,370.44 it be estimate that the receipt of the 4th quarter of the year will exceed the demand which will be make on the treasury during the same period and that the amount in the treasury on the 30th of september last will be increase on the first day of january next at the close of the last session it be anticipate that the progressive diminution of the public revenue in 1819 and 1820 which have be the result of the languid state of our foreign commerce in those year have in the latter year reach its extreme point of depression it have however be ascertain that that point be reach only at the termination of the first quarter of the present year from that time until the 30th of september last the duty secure have exceed those of the correspond quarter of the last year $ 1.172 m whilst the amount of debenture issue during the three first quarter of this year be $ 952,000 less than that of the same quarter of the last year there be just ground to believe that the improvement which have occur in the revenue during the last mention period will not only be maintain but that it will progressively increase through the next and several succeed year so as to realize the result which be present upon that subject by the official report of the treasury at the commencement of the last session of congress under the influence of the most unfavorable circumstance the revenue for the next and subsequent year to the year 1825 will exceed the demand at present authorize by law it may fairly be presume that under the protection give to domestic manufacture by the exist law we shall become at no distant period a manufacture country on an extensive scale possess as we do the raw material in such vast amount with a capacity to augment they to an indefinite extent raise within the country aliment of every kind to an amount far exceed the demand for home consumption even in the most unfavorable year and to be obtain always at a very moderate price skilled also as our people be in the mechanic art and in every improvement calculate to lessen the demand for and the price of labor it be manifest that their success in every branch of domestic industry may and will be carry under the encouragement give by the present duty to an extent to meet any demand which under a fair competition may be make upon it a considerable increase of domestic manufacture by diminish the importation of foreign will probably tend to lessen the amount of the public revenue as however a large proportion of the revenue which be derive from duty be raise from other article than manufacture the demand for which will increase with our population it be believe that a fund will still be raise from that source adequate to the great part of the public expenditure especially as those expenditure should we continue to be bless with peace will be diminish by the completion of the fortification dock yard and other public work by the augmentation of the navy to the point to which it be propose to carry it and by the payment of the public debt include pension for military service it can not be doubt that the more complete our internal resource and the less dependent we be on foreign power for every national as well as domestic purpose the great and more stable will be the public felicity by the increase of domestic manufacture will the demand for the rude material at home be increase and thus will the dependence of the several part of our union on each other and the strength of the union itself be proportionably augmented in this process which be very desirable and inevitable under the exist duty the resource which obviously present themselves to supply a deficiency in the revenue should it occur be the interest which may derive the principal benefit from the change if domestic manufacture be raise by duty on foreign the deficiency in the fund necessary for public purpose should be supply by duty on the former at the last session it seem doubtful whether the revenue derive from the present source would be adequate to all the great purpose of our union include the construction of our fortification the augmentation of the navy and the protection of our commerce against the danger to which it be expose have the deficiency be such as to subject we to the necessity either to abandon those measure of defense or to resort to the other mean for adequate fund the course present to the adoption of a virtuous and enlightened people appear to be a plain one it must be gratify to all to know that this necessity do not exist nothing however in contemplation of such important object which can be easily provide for should be leave to hazard it be think that the revenue may receive an augmentation from the exist source and in a manner to aid our manufacture without hasten prematurely the result which have be suggest it be believe that a moderate additional duty on certain article would have that effect without be liable to any serious objection the examination of the whole coast for the construction of permanent fortification from st. croix to the sabine with the exception of part of the territory lately acquire will be complete in the present year as will be the survey of the mississippi under the resolution of the house of representatives from the mouth of the ohio to the ocean and likewise of the ohio from louisville to the mississippi a progress correspond with the sum appropriate have also be make in the construction of these fortification at the port designate as they will form a system of defense for the whole maritime frontier and in consequence for the interior and be to last for age the great care have be take to fix the position of each work and to form it on such a scale as will be adequate to the purpose intend by it all the inlet and assailable part of our union have be minutely examine and position take with a view to the good effect observe in every instance a just regard for economy doubt however be entertain as to the propriety of the position and extent of the work at dauphine island further progress in it be suspend soon after the last session of congress and an order give to the board of engineers and naval commissioners to make a further and more minute examination of it in both respect and to report the result without delay due progress have be make in the construction of vessel of war accord to the law provide for the gradual augmentation of the navy and to the extent of exist appropriation the vessel authorize by the act of 1820 have all be complete and be now in actual service none of the large ship have be or will be launch for the present the object be to protect all which may not be require for immediate service from decay by suitable building erect over they a squadron have be maintain as heretofore in the mediterranean by mean whereof peace have be preserve with the barbary powers this squadron have be reduce the present year to as small a force as be compatible with the fulfillment of the object intend by it from past experience and the good information respect the view of those power it be distinctly understand that should our squadron be withdraw they would soon recommence their hostility and depredation upon our commerce their fortification have lately be rebuild and their maritime force increase it have also be find necessary to maintain a naval force on the pacific for the protection of the very important interest of our citizen engage in commerce and the fishery in that sea vessel have likewise be employ in cruise along the atlantic coast in the gulf of mexico on the coast of africa and in the neighboring sea in the latter many piracy have be commit on our commerce and so extensive be become the range of those unprincipled adventurer that there be cause to apprehend without a timely and decisive effort to suppress they the bad consequence would ensue fortunately a considerable check have be give to that spirit by our cruiser who have succeed in capture and destroy several of their vessel nevertheless it be consider an object of high importance to continue these cruise until the practice be entirely suppress like success have attend our effort to suppress the slave trade under the flag of the united states and the sanction of their paper the trade may be consider as entire suppress and if any of our citizen be engage in it under the flag and paper of other power it be only from a respect of those power that these offender be not seize and bring home to receive the punishment which the law inflict if every other power should adopt the same policy and pursue the same vigorous mean for carry it into effect the trade could no long exist deeply impressed with the blessing which we enjoy and of which we have such manifold proof my mind be irresistibly draw to that almighty being the great source from whence they proceed and to whom our most grateful acknowledgment be due
fellow citizen of the senate and house of representatives many cause unite to make your present meeting peculiarly interesting to out constituent the operation of our law on the various subject to which they apply with the amendment which they occasionally require impose annually an important duty on the representative of a free people our system have happily advance to such maturity that i be not aware that your care in that respect will be augment other cause exist which be highly interesting to the whole civilized world and to no portion of it more so in certain view than to the united states of these cause and of their bearing on the interest of our union i shall communicate the sentiment which i have form with that freedom which a sense of duty dictate it be proper however to invite your attention in the first instance to those concern respect which legislative provision be think to be particularly urgent on the 24th of june last a convention of navigation and commerce be conclude in this city between the united states and france by minister duly authorize for the purpose the sanction of the executive having be give to this convention under a conviction that take all its stipulation into view it rest essentially on a basis of reciprocal and equal advantage i deem it my duty in compliance with the authority vest in the executive by the second section of the act of the last session of the 6th of may concern navigation to suspend by proclamation until the end of the next session of congress the operation of the act entitle an act to impose a new tonnage duty on french ship and vessel and for other purpose and to suspend likewise all other duty on french vessel or the good import in they which exceed the duty on american vessel and on similar good import in they i shall submit this convention forthwith to the senate for its advice and consent as to the ratification since your last session the prohibition which have be impose on the commerce between the united states and the british colony in the west indies and on this continent have likewise be remove satisfactory evidence having be adduce that the port of those colony have be open to the vessel of the united states by an act of the british parliament bear date on the 24th of june last on the condition specify therein i deem it proper in compliance with the provision of the first section of the act of the last session above recite to declare by proclamation bearing date on the 24th of august last that the port of the united states should thenceforward and until the end of the next session of congress be open to the vessel of great britain employ in that trade under the limitation specify in that proclamation a doubt be entertain whether the act of congress apply to the british colony on this continent as well as to those in the west indies but as the act of parliament open the intercourse equally with both and it be the manifest intention of congress as well as the obvious policy of the united states that the provision of the act of parliament should be meet in equal extent on the part of the united states and as also the act of congress be suppose to vest in the president some discretion in the execution of it i think it advisable to give it a corresponding construction should the constitutional sanction of the senate be give to the ratification of the convention with france legislative provision will be necessary to carry it fully into effect as it likewise will be to continue in force on such condition as may be deem just and proper the intercourse which have be open between the united states and the british colony every light in the possession of the executive will in due time be communicate on both subject rest essentially on a basis of reciprocal and equal advantage it have be the object of the executive in transaction with other power to meet the proposition of each with a liberal spirit believe that thereby the interest of our country would be most effectually promote this course have be systematically pursue in the late occurrence with france and great britain and in strict accord with the view of the legislature a confident hope be entertain that by the arrangement thus commence with each all difference respect navigation and commerce with the dominion in question will be adjust and a solid foundation be lay for an active and permanent intercourse which will prove equally advantageous to both party the decision of his imperial majesty the emperor of russia on the question submit to he by the united states and great britain concern the construction of the first article of the treaty of ghent have be receive a convention have since be conclude between the party under the mediation of his imperial majesty to prescribe the mode by which that article shall be carry into effect in conformity with that decision i shall submit this convention to the senate for its advice and consent as to the ratification and if obtain shall immediately bring the subject before congress for such provision as may require the interposition of the legislature in compliance with an act of the last session a territorial government have be establish in florida on the principle of our system by this act the inhabitant be secure in the full enjoyment of their right and liberty and to admission into the union with equal participation in the government with the original state on the condition heretofore prescribe to other territory by a clause in the ninth article of the treaty with spain by which that territory be cede to the united states it be stipulate that satisfaction shall be make for the injury if any which by process of law shall be establish to have be suffer by the spanish officer and individual spanish inhabitant by the late operation of our troop in florida no provision having yet be make to carry that stipulation into effect it be submit to the consideration of congress whether it will not be proper to vest the competent power in the district court at pensacola or in some tribunal to be specially organize for the purpose the fiscal operation of the year have be more successful than have be anticipate at the commencement of the last session of congress the receipt into the treasury during the three first quarter of the year have exceed the sum of $ 14.745 million the payment make at the treasury during the same period have exceed $ 12.279 million leave the treasury on the 30th day of september last include $ 1,168,592.24 which be in the treasury on the first day of january last a sum exceed $ 4.128 million besides discharge all demand for the current service of the year include the interest and reimbursement of the public debt the 6 percent stock of 1796 amount to $ 80,000 have be redeem it be estimate that after defray the current expense of the present quarter and redeem the $ 2 million of 6 percent stock of 1820 there will remain in the treasury on the first of january next nearly $ 3 million it be estimate that the gross amount of duty which have be secure from the first of january to the 30th of september last have exceed $ 19.5 million and the amount for the whole year will probably not fall short of $ 23 million of the actual force in service under the present military establishment the post at which it be station and the condition of each post a report from the secretary of war which be now communicate will give a distinct idea by like report the state of the academy at west point will be see as will be the progress which have be make on the fortification along the coast and at the national armory and arsenal the organization of the several corp compose the army be such as to admit its expansion to a great extent in case of emergency the officer carry with they all the light which they possess to the new corp to which they might be appoint with the organization of the staff there be equal cause to be satisfy by the concentration of every branch with its chief in this city in the presence of the department and with a grade in the chief military station to keep alive and cherish a military spirit the great promptitude in the execution of order with the great economy and efficiency be secure the same view be take of the military academy good order be preserve in it and the youth be well instruct in every science connect with the great object of the institution they be also well train and discipline in the practical part of the profession it have be always find difficult to control the ardor inseparable from that early age in such manner as to give it a proper direction the right of manhood be too often claim prematurely in press which too far the respect which be due to age and the obedience necessary to a course of study and instruction in every such institution be sometimes lose sight of the great object to be accomplish be the restraint of that ardor by such wise regulation and government as by direct all the energy of the youthful mind to the attainment of useful knowledge will keep it within a just subordination and at the same time elevate it to the high purpose this object seem to be essentially obtain in this institution and with great advantage to the union the military academy form the basis in regard to science on which the military establishment rest it furnish annually after due examination and on the report of the academic staff many well inform youth to fill the vacancy which occur in the several corp of the army while other who retire to private life carry with they such attainment as under the right reserve to the several state to appoint the officer and to train the militia will enable they by afford a wide field for selection to promote the great object of the power vest in congress of provide for the organizing arming and discipline the militia thus by the mutual and harmonious cooperation of the two government in the execution of a power divide between they an object always to be cherish the attainment of a great result on which our liberty may depend can not fail to be secure i have to add that in proportion as our regular force be small should the instruction and discipline of the militia the great resource on which we rely be push to the utmost extent that circumstance will admit a report from the secretary of the navy will communicate the progress which have be make in the construction of vessel of war with other interesting detail respect the actual state of the affair of that department it have be find necessary for the protection of our commerce to maintain the usual squadron on the mediterranean the pacific and along the atlantic coast extend the cruise of the latter into the west indies where piracy organize into a system have prey on the commerce of every country trade thither a cruise have also be maintain on the coast of africa when the season would permit for the suppression of the slave trade and order have be give to the commander of all our public ship to seize our own vessel should they find any engaging in that trade and to bring they in for adjudication in the west indies piracy be of recent date which may explain the cause why other power have not combine against it by the document communicate it will be see that the effort of the united states to suppress it have have a very salutary effect the benevolent provision of the act under which the protection have be extend alike to the commerce of other nation can not fail to be duly appreciate by they in compliance with the act of the last session entitle an act to abolish the united states trading establishment agent be immediately appoint and instruct under the direction of the secretary of the treasury to close the business of the trading house among the indian tribe and to settle the account of the factor and subfactor engage in that trade and to execute in all other respect the injunction of that act in the mode prescribe therein a final report of their proceeding shall be communicate to congress as soon as it be receive it be with great regret i have to state that a serious malady have deprive we of many valuable citizen of pensacola and check the progress of some of those arrangement which be important to the territory this effect have be sensibly feel in respect to the indians who inhabit that territory consist of the remnant of the several tribe who occupy the middle ground between st. augustine and pensacola with extensive claim but undefined boundary although peace be preserve with those indians yet their position and claim tend essentially to interrupt the intercourse between the eastern and western part of the territory on which our inhabitant be principally settle it be essential to the growth and prosperity of the territory as well as to the interest of the union that those indians should be remove by special compact with they to some other position or concentration within narrow limit where they be with the limited mean in the power of the executive instruction be give to the governor to accomplish this object so far as it might be practicable which be prevent by the distressing malady refer to to carry it fully into effect in either mode additional fund will be necessary to the provision of which the power of congress be competent with a view to such provision as may be deem proper the subject be submit to your consideration and in the interim further proceeding be suspend it appear that so much of the act entitle an act regulate the staff of the army which pass on 1818 04 14 as relate to the commissariat will expire in april next and the practical operation of that department having evince its great utility the propriety of its renewal be submit to your consideration the view which have be take of the probable productiveness of the lead mine connect with the importance of the material to the public defense make it expedient that they should be manage with peculiar care it be therefore suggest whether it will not comport with the public interest to provide by law for the appointment of an agent skilled in mineralogy to superintend they under the direction of the proper department it be understand that the cumberland road which be construct at great expense have already suffer from the want of that regular superintendence and of those repair which be indispensable to the preservation of such a work this road be of incalculable advantage in facilitate the intercourse between the western and the atlantic state through the whole country from the northern extremity of lake erie to the mississippi and from all the water which empty into each find and easy and direct communication to the seat of government and thence to the atlantic the facility which it afford to all military and commercial operation and also to those of the post office department can not be estimate too highly this great work be likewise an ornament and an honor to the nation believe that a competent power to adopt and execute a system of internal improvement have not be grant to congress but that such a power confine to great national purpose and with proper limitation would be productive of eminent advantage to our union i have think it advisable that an amendment of the constitution to that effect should be recommend to the several state a bill which assume the right to adopt and execute such a system having be present for my signature at the last session i be compel from the view which i have take of the power of the general government to negative it on which occasion i think it proper to communicate the sentiment which i have form on mature consideration on the whole subject to that communication in all the view in which the great interest to which it relate may be suppose to merit your attention i have now to refer should congress however deem it improper to recommend such an amendment they have accord to my judgment the right to keep the road in repair by provide for the superintendence of it and appropriating the money necessary for repair surely if they have the right to appropriate money to make the road they have a right to appropriate it to preserve the road from ruin from the exercise of this power no danger be to be apprehend under our happy system the people be the sole and exclusive fountain of power each government originate from they and to they alone each to its proper constituent be they respectively and solely responsible for the faithful discharge of their duty within their constitutional limit and that the people will confine their public agent of every station to the strict line of their constitutional duty there be no cause of doubt have however communicate my sentiment to congress at the last session fully in the document to which i have refer respect the right of appropriation as distinct from the right of jurisdiction and sovereignty over the territory in question i deem it improper to enlarge on the subject here from the good information i have be able to obtain it appear that our manufacture though depress immediately after the peace have considerably increase and be still increase under the encouragement give they by the tariff of 1816 and by subsequent law satisfied i be whatever may be the abstract doctrine in favor of unrestricted commerce provide all nation would concur in it and it be not liable to be interrupt by war which have never occur and can not be expect that there be other strong reason applicable to our situation and relation with other country which impose on we the obligation to cherish and sustain our manufacture satisfy however i likewise be that the interest of every part of our union even of those most benefit by manufacture require that this subject should be touch with the great caution and a critical knowledge of the effect to be produce by the slight change on full consideration of the subject in all its relation i be persuade that a further augmentation may now be make of the duty on certain foreign article in favor of our own and without affect injuriously any other interest for more precise detail i refer you to the communication which be make to congress during the last session so great be the amount of account for money advance during the late war in addition to other of a previous date which in the regular operation of the government necessarily remain unsettled that it require a considerable length of time for their adjustment by a report from the first comptroller of the treasury it appear that on 1817 03 04 the account then unsettle amount to $ 103,068,876.41 of which on 1922 09 30 $ 93,175,396.56 have be settle leave on that day a balance unsettle of $ 9,893,479.85 that there have be draw from the treasury in pay the public debt and sustain the government in all its operation and disbursement since 1817 03 04 $ 157,199,380.96 the account for which have be settle to the amount of $ 137,501,451.12 leave a balance unsettle of $ 19,697,929.84 for precise detail respect each of these balance i refer to the report of the comptroller and the document which accompany it from this view it appear   that our commercial difference with france and great britain have be place in a train of amicable arrangement on condition fair and honorable in both instance to each party   that our finance be in a very productive state our revenue be at present fully competent to all the demand upon it   that our military force be well organize in all its branch and capable of render the most important service in case of emergency that its number will admit of   that due progress have be make under exist appropriation in the construction of fortification and in the operation of the ordnance department   that due progress have in like manner be make in the construction of ship of war   that our navy be in the good condition feel and respect in every sea in which it be employ for the protection of our commerce   that our manufacture have augment in amount and improve in quality that great progress have be make in the settlement of account and in the recovery of the balance due by individual and   that the utmost economy be secure and observe in every department of the administration   other object will likewise claim your attention because from the station which the united states hold as a member of the great community of nation they have right to maintain duty to perform and danger to encounter a strong hope be entertain that peace would ere this have be conclude between spain and the independent government south of the united states in this hemisphere long experience having evince the competency of those government to maintain the independence which they have declare it be presume that the consideration which induce their recognition by the united states would have have equal weight with other power and that spain herself yield to those magnanimous feeling of which her history furnish so many example would have terminate on that basis a controversy so unavaile and at the same time so destructive we still cherish the hope that this result will not long be postpone sustain our neutral position and allow to each party while the war continue equal right it be incumbent on the united states to claim of each with equal rigor the faithful observance of our right accord to the well know law of nation from each therefore a like cooperation be expect in the suppression of the piratical practice which have grow out of this war and of blockade of extensive coast on both sea which consider the small force employ to sustain they have not the slight foundation to rest on europe be still unsettled and although the war long menace between russia and turkey have not break out there be no certainty that the difference between those power will be amicably adjust it be impossible to look to the oppression of the country respect which those difference arise without be deeply affect the mention of greece fill the mind with the most exalted sentiment and arouse in our bosom the good feeling of which our nature be susceptible superior skill and refinement in the art heroic gallantry in action disinterested patriotism enthusiastic zeal and devotion in favor of public and personal liberty be associate with our recollection of ancient greece that such a country should have be overwhelmed and so long hide as it be from the world under a gloomy despotism have be a cause of unceasing and deep regret to generous mind for age past it be natural therefore that the reappearance of those people in their original character contend in favor of their liberty should produce that great excitement and sympathy in their favor which have be so signally display throughout the united states a strong hope be entertain that these people will recover their independence and resume their equal station among the nation of the earth a great effort have be make in spain and portugal to improve the condition of the people and it must be very consoling to all benevolent mind to see the extraordinary moderation with which it have be conduct that it may promote the happiness of both nation be the ardent wish of this whole people to the expression of which we confine ourselves for whatever may be the feeling or sentiment which every individual under our government have a right to indulge and express it be nevertheless a sacred maxim equally with the government and people that the destiny of every independent nation in what relate to such improvement of right belong and ought to be leave exclusively to themselves whether we reason from the late war or from those menacing symptom which now appear in europe it be manifest that if a convulsion should take place in any of those country it will proceed from cause which have no existence and be utterly unknown in these state in which there be but one order that of the people to whom the sovereignty exclusively belong should war break out in any of those country who can foretell the extent to which it may be carry or the desolation which it may spread exempt as we be from these cause our internal tranquillity be secure and distant as we be from the troubled scene and faithful to first principle in regard to other power we might reasonably presume that we should not be molest by they this however ought not to be calculate on as certain unprovoked injury be often inflict and even the peculiar felicity of our situation might with some be a cause for excitement and aggression the history of the late war in europe furnish a complete demonstration   that no system of conduct however correct in principle can protect neutral power from injury from any party   that a defenseless position and distinguished love of peace be the sure invitation to war and   that there be no way to avoid it other than by be always prepared and willing for just cause to meet it   if there be a people on earth whose more especial duty it be to be at all time prepare to defend the right with which they be bless and to surpass all other in sustain the necessary burthen and in submit to sacrifice to make such preparation it be undoubtedly the people of these state when we see    that a civil war of the most frightful character rage from the adriatic to the black sea   that strong symptom of war appear in other part proceed from cause which should it break out may become general and be of long duration   that the war still continue between spain and the independent government her late province in this hemisphere   that it be likewise menace between portugal and brazil in consequence of the attempt of the latter to dismember itself from the former and   that a system of piracy of great extent be maintain in the neighboring sea which will require equal vigilance and decision to suppress it the reason for sustain the attitude which we now hold and for push forward all our measure of defense with the utmost vigor appear to i to acquire new force the united states owe to the world a great example and by mean thereof to the cause of liberty and humanity a generous support they have so far succeed to the satisfaction of the virtuous and enlightened of every country there be no reason to doubt that their whole movement will be regulate by a sacred regard to principle all our institution be found on that basis the ability to support our own cause under any trial to which it may be expose be the great point on which the public solicitude rest it have be often charge against free government   that they have neither the foresight nor the virtue to provide at the proper season for great emergency   that their course be improvident and expensive   that war will always find they unprepared and whatever may be its calamity   that its terrible warning will be disregard and forget as soon as peace return i have full confidence that this charge so far as relate to the united states will be shew to be utterly destitute of truth
fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives many important subject will claim your attention during the present session of which i shall endeavor to give in aid of your deliberation a just idea in this communication i undertake this duty with diffidence from the vast extent of the interest on which i have to treat and of their great importance to every portion of our union i enter on it with zeal from a thorough conviction that there never be a period since the establishment of our revolution when regard the condition of the civilized world and its bearing on we there be great necessity for devotion in the public servant to their respective duty or for virtue patriotism and union in our constituent meet in you a new congress i deem it proper to present this view of public affair in great detail than might otherwise be necessary i do it however with peculiar satisfaction from a knowledge that in this respect i shall comply more fully with the sound principle of our government the people be with we exclusively the sovereign it be indispensable that full information be lay before they on all important subject to enable they to exercise that high power with complete effect if keep in the dark they must be incompetent to it we be all liable to error and those who be engage in the management of public affair be more subject to excitement and to be lead astray by their particular interest and passion than the great body of our constituent who live at home in the pursuit of their ordinary avocation be calm but deeply interested spectator of event and of the conduct of those who be party to they to the people every department of the government and every individual in each be responsible and the more full their information the well they can judge of the wisdom of the policy pursue and of the conduct of each in regard to it from their dispassionate judgment much aid may always be obtain while their approbation will form the great incentive and most gratifying reward for virtuous action and the dread of their censure the good security against the abuse of their confidence their interest in all vital question be the same and the bond by sentiment as well as by interest will be proportionably strengthen as they be well informed of the real state of public affair especially in difficult conjuncture it be by such knowledge that local prejudice and jealousy be surmount and that a national policy extend its foster care and protection to all the great interest of our union be form and steadily adhere to a precise knowledge of our relation with foreign power as respect our negotiation and transaction with each be think to be particularly necessary equally necessary be it that we should for a just estimate of our resource revenue and progress in every kind of improvement connect with the national prosperity and public defense it be by render justice to other nation that we may expect it from they it be by our ability to resent injury and redress wrong that we may avoid they the commissioner under the 5th article of the treaty of ghent having disagree in their opinion respect that portion of the boundary between the territories of the united states and of great britain the establishment of which have be submit to they have make their respective report in compliance with that article that the same might be refer to the decision of a friendly power it be manifest however that it would be difficult if not impossible for any power to perform that office without great delay and much inconvenience to itself a proposal have be make by this government and accede to by that of great britain to endeavor to establish that boundary by amicable negotiation it appear from long experience that no satisfactory arrangement could be form of the commercial intercourse between the united states and the british colony in this hemisphere by legislative act while each party pursue its own course without agreement or concert with the other a proposal have be make to the british government to regulate this commerce by treaty as it have be to arrange in like manner the just claim of the citizen of the united states inhabit the states and territories border on the lake and river which empty into the st. lawrence to the navigation of that river to the ocean for these and other object of high importance to the interest of both party a negotiation have be open with the british government which it be hope will have a satisfactory result the commissioner under the 6th and 7th article of the treaty of ghent having successfully close their labor in relation to the 6th have proceed to the discharge of those relate to the 7th their progress in the extensive survey require for the performance of their duty justify the presumption that it will be complete in the ensue year the negotiation which have be long depend with the french government on several important subject and particularly for a just indemnity for loss sustain in the late war by the citizen of the united states under unjustifiable seizure and confiscation of their property have not as yet have the desire effect as this claim rest on the same principle with other which have be admit by the french government it be not perceive on what just grind it can be reject a minister will be immediately appoint to proceed to france and resume the negotiation on this and other subject which may arise between the two nation at the proposal of the russian imperial government make through the minister of the emperor reside here a full power and instruction have be transmit to the minister of the united states at st. petersburg to arrange by amicable negotiation the respective right and interest of the two nation on the north west coast of this continent a similar proposal have be make by his imperial majesty to the government of great britain which have likewise be accede to the government of the united states have be desirous by this friendly proceeding of manifest the great value which they have invariably attach to the friendship of the emperor and their solicitude to cultivate the good understanding with his government in the discussion to which this interest have give rise and in the arrangement by which they may terminate the occasion have be judge proper for assert as a principle in which the right and interest of the united states be involve that the american continent by the free and independent condition which they have assume and maintain be henceforth not to be consider as subject for future colonization by any european power since the close of the last session of congress the commissioner and arbitrator for ascertain and determine the amount of indemnification which may be due to citizen of the united states under the decision of his imperial majesty the emperor of russia in conformity to the convention conclude at st. petersburg on 1822 07 12 have assemble in this city and organize themselves as a board for the performance of the duty assign to they by that treaty the commission constitute under the 11th article of the treaty of 1819 02 22 between the united states and spain be also in session here and as the term of three year limit by the treaty for the execution of the trust will expire before the period of the next regular meeting of congress the attention of the legislature will be draw to the measure which may be necessary to accomplish the object for which the commission be institute in compliance with a resolution of the house of representatives adopt at their last session instruction have be give to all the minister of the united states accredit to the power of europe and america to propose the proscription of the african slave trade by class it under the denomination and inflict on its perpetrator the punishment of piracy should this proposal be accede to it be not doubted that this odious and criminal practice will be promptly and entirely suppress it be earnestly hope that it will be accede to from the firm belief that it be the most effectual expedient that can be adopt for the purpose at the commencement of the recent war between france and spain it be declare by the french government that it would grant no commission to privateer and that neither the commerce of spain herself nor of neutral nation should be molest by the naval force of france except in the breach of a lawful blockade this declaration which appear to have be faithfully carry into effect concur with principle proclaim and cherish by the united states from the first establishment of their independence suggest the hope that the time have arrive when the proposal for adopt it as a permanent and invariable rule in all future maritime war might meet the favorable consideration of the great european power instruction have accordingly be give to our minister with france russia and great britain to make those proposal to their respective government and when the friend of humanity reflect on the essential amelioration to the condition of the human race which would result from the abolition of private war on the sea and on the great facility by which it might be accomplish require only the consent of a few sovereign an earnest hope be indulge that these overture will meet with an attention animate by the spirit in which they be make and that they will ultimately be successful the minister who be appoint to the republics of colombia and buenos ayres during the last session of congress proceed shortly afterwards to their destination of their arrival there official intelligence have not yet be receive the minister appoint to the republic of chile will sail in a few day an early appointment will also be make to mexico a minister have be receive from colombia and the other government have be inform that minister or diplomatic agent of inferior grade would be receive from each accordingly as they might prefer the one or the other the minister appoint to spain proceed soon after his appointment for cadiz the residence of the sovereign to whom he be accredit in approach that port the frigate which convey he be warn off by the commander of the french squadron by which it be blockade and not permit to enter although apprise by the captain of the frigate of the public character of the person whom he have on board the landing of whom be the sole object of his propose entry this act be consider an infringement of the right of ambassador and of nation will form a just cause of complaint to the government of france against the officer by whom it be commit the actual condition of the public finance more than realize the favorable anticipation that be entertain of it at the opening of the last session of congress on the first of january there be a balance in the treasury of $ 4,237,427.55 from that time to the 30th of september the receipt amount to upward of $ 16.1 m and the expenditure to $ 11.4m. during the 4th quarter of the year it be estimate that the receipt will at least equal the expenditure and that there will remain in the treasury on the first day of january next a surplus of nearly $ 9m. on 1825 01 01 a large amount of the war debt and a part of the revolutionary debt become redeemable additional portion of the former will continue to become redeemable annually until the year 1835 it be believe however that if the united states remain at peace the whole of that debt may be redeem by the ordinary revenue of those year during that period under the provision of the act of 1817 03 03 create the sink fund and in that case the only part of the debt that will remain after the year 1835 will be the $ 7 m of 5 stock subscribe to the bank of the united states and the 3 revolutionary debt amount to $ 13,296,099.06 both of which be redeemable at the pleasure of the government the state of the army in its organization and discipline have be gradually improve for several year and have now attain a high degree of perfection the military disbursement have be regularly make and the account regularly and promptly render for settlement the supply of various description have be of good quality and regularly issue at all of the post a system of economy and accountability have be introduce into every branch of the service which admit of little additional improvement this desirable state have be attain by the act reorganize the staff of the army pass on 1818 04 14 the money appropriate for fortification have be regularly and economically apply and all the work advance as rapidly as the amount appropriate would admit three important work will be complete in the course of this year that be fort washington fort delaware and the fort at the rigolets in louisiana the board of engineers and the topographical corps have be in constant and active service in survey the coast and project the work necessary for its defense the military academy have attain a degree of perfection in its discipline and instruction equal as be believe to any institution of its kind in any country the money appropriate for the use of the ordnance department have be regularly and economically apply the fabrication of arm at the national armory and by contract with the department have be gradually improve in quality and cheapness it be believe that their quality be now such as to admit of but little improvement the completion of the fortification render it necessary that there should be a suitable appropriation for the purpose of fabricate the cannon and carriage necessary for those work under the appropriation of $ 5,000 for explore the western water for the location of a site for a western armory a commission be constitute consist of colonel mcree colonel lee and captain talcott who have be engage in explore the country they have not yet report the result of their labor but it be believe that they will be prepared to do it at an early part of the session of congress during the month of june last general ashley and his party who be trade under a license from the government be attack by the ricarees while peaceably trade with the indians at their request several of the party be kill and wound and their property take or destroy colonel leavenworth who command fort atkinson at the council bluffs the most western post apprehend that the hostile spirit of the ricarees would extend to other tribe in that quarter and that thereby the life of the trader on the missouri and the peace of the frontier would be endanger take immediate measure to check the evil with a detachment of the regiment station at the bluffs he successfully attack the ricaree village and it be hope that such an impression have be make on they as well as on the other tribe on the missouri as will prevent a recurrence of future hostility the report of the secretary of war which be herewith transmit will exhibit in great detail the condition of the department in its various branch and the progress which have be make in its administration during the three first quarter of the year i transmit a return of the militia of the several states accord to the last report which have be make by the proper officer in each to the department of war by reference to this return it will be see that it be not complete although great exertion have be make to make it so as the defense and even the liberty of the country must depend in time of imminent danger on the militia it be of the high importance that it be well organize armed and discipline throughout the union the report of the secretary of war shews the progress make during the three first quarter of the present year by the application of the fund appropriate for arm the militia much difficulty be find in distribute the arm accord to the act of congress provide for it from the failure of the proper department in many of the states to make regular return the act of 1820 05 12 provide that the system of tactic and regulation of the various corp of the regular army shall be extend to the militia this act have be very imperfectly execute from the want of uniformity in the organization of the militia proceed from the defect of the system itself and especially in its application to that main arm of the public defense it be think that this important subject in all its branch merit the attention of congress the report of the secretary of the navy which be now communicate furnish an account of the administration of that department for the three first quarter of the present year with the progress make in augment the navy and the manner in which the vessel in commission have be employ the usual force have be maintain in the mediterranean sea the pacific ocean and along the atlantic coast and have afford the necessary protection to our commerce in those sea in the west indies and the gulf of mexico our naval force have be augment by the addition of several small vessel provide for by the act authorize an additional naval force for the suppression of piracy pass by congress at their last session that armament have be eminently successful in the accomplishment of its object the piracy by which our commerce in the neighborhood of the island of cuba have be afflict have be repress and the confidence of our merchant in a great measure restore the patriotic zeal and enterprise of commodore porter to whom the command of the expedition be confide have be fully second by the officer and man under his command and in reflect with high satisfaction on the honorable manner in which they have sustain the reputation of their country and its navy the sentiment be alloy only by a concern that in the fulfillment of that arduous service the disease incident to the season and to the climate in which it be discharge have deprive the nation of many useful life and among they of several officer of great promise in the month of august a very malignant fever make its appearance at thompsons island which threaten the destruction of our station there many perish and the command officer be severely attack uncertain as to his fate and know that most of the medical officer have be render incapable of discharge their duty it be think expedient to send to that post an officer of rank and experience with several skilled surgeon to ascertain the origin of the fever and the probability of its recurrence there in future season to furnish every assistance to those who be suffer and if practicable to avoid the necessity of abandon so important a station commodore rodgers with a promptitude which do he honor cheerfully accept that trust and have discharge it in the manner anticipate from his skill and patriotism before his arrival commodore porter with the great part of the squadron have remove from the island and return to the united states in consequence of the prevail sickness much useful information have however be obtain as to the state of the island and great relief afford to those who have be necessarily leave there although our expedition cooperate with an invigorate administration of the government of the island of cuba and with the correspond active exertion of a british naval force in the same sea have almost entirely destroy the unlicensed piracy from that island the success of our exertion have not be equally effectual to suppress the same crime under other pretense and color in the neighbor island of porto rico they have be commit there under the abusive issue of spanish commission at an early period of the present year remonstrance be make to the governor of that island by an agent who be send for the purpose against those outrage on the peaceful commerce of the united states of which many have occur that officer profess his own want of authority to make satisfaction for our just complaint answer only by a reference of they to the government of spain the minister of the united states to that court be specially instruct to urge the necessity of immediate and effectual interposition of that government direct restitution and indemnity for wrong already commit and interdict the repetition of they the minister as have be see be debarred access to the spanish government and in the mean time several new case of flagrant outrage have occur and citizen of the united states in the island of porto rico have suffer and other be threaten with assassination for assert their unquestionable right even before the lawful tribunal of the country the usual order have be give to all our public ship to seize american vessel in the slave trade and bring they in for adjudication and i have the gratification to state that not one so employ have be discover and there be good reason to believe that our flag be now seldom if at all disgrace by that traffic it be a source of great satisfaction that we be always enable to recur to the conduct of our navy with price and commendation as a means of national defense it enjoy the public confidence and be steadily assume additional importance it be submit whether a more efficient and equally economical organization of it might not in several respect be effect it be suppose that high grade than now exist by law would be useful they would afford well merit reward to those who have long and faithfully serve their country present the good incentive to good conduct and the good mean of insure a proper discipline destroy the inequality in that respect between military and naval service and relieve our officer from many inconvenience and mortification which occur when our vessel meet those of other nation our be the only service in which such grade do not exist a report of the postmaster general which accompany this communication will shew the present state of the post office department and its general operation for some year past there be establish by law 88,600 mile of post road on which the mail be now transport 85,700 mile and contract have be make for its transportation on all the establish route with one or 2 exception there be 5,240 post office in the union and as many post master the gross amount of postage which accrue from 1822 07 01 to 1823 07 01 be $ 1,114,345.12 during the same period the expenditure of the post office department amount to $ 1,169,885.51 and consist of the follow item viz compensation to post master $ 353,995.98 incidental expense $ 30,866.37 transportation of the mail $ 784,600.08 payment into the treasury $ 423.08 on the first of july last there be due to the department from post master $ 135,245.28 from late post master and contractor $ 256,749.31 make a total amount of balance due to the department of $ 391,994.59.these balance embrace all delinquency of post master and contractor which have take place since the organization of the department there be due by the department to contractor on the first of july last $ 26,548.64 the transportation of the mail within five year past have be greatly extend and the expenditure of the department proportionably increase although the postage which have accrue within the last three year have fall short of the expenditure $ 262,821.46 it appear that collection have be make from the outstanding balance to meet the principal part of the current demand it be estimate that not more than $ 250,000 of the above balance can be collect and that a considerable part of this sum can only be realize by a resort to legal process some improvement in the receipt for postage be expect a prompt attention to the collection of money receive by post master it be believe will enable the department to continue its operation without aid from the treasury unless the expenditure shall be increase by the establishment of new mail route a revision of some part of the post office law may be necessary and it be submit whether it would not be proper to provide for the appointment of post master where the compensation exceed a certain amount by nomination to the senate as other officer of the general government be appoint having communicate my view to congress at the commencement of the last session respect the encouragement which ought to be give to our manufacture and the principle on which it should be found i have only to add that those view remain unchanged and that the present state of those country with which we have the most immediate political relation and great commercial intercourse tend to confirm they under this impression i recommend a review of the tariff for the purpose of afford such additional protection to those article which we be prepared to manufacture or which be more immediately connect with the defense and independence of the country the actual state of the public account furnish additional evidence of the efficiency of the present system of accountability in relation to the public expenditure of the money draw from the treasury since 1817 03 04 the sum remain unaccounted for on the 30th of september last be more than $ 1.5 m less than on the 30th of september precede and during the same period a reduction of nearly $ 1 m have be make in the amount of the unsettled account for money advance previously to 1817 03 04 it will be obvious that in proportion as the mass of account of the latter description be diminish by settlement the difficulty of settle the residue be increase from the consideration that in many instance it can be obtain only by legal process for more precise detail on this subject i refer to a report from the first comptroller of the treasury the sum which be appropriate at the last session for the repair of the cumberland road have be apply with good effect to that object a final report have not be receive from the agent who be appoint to superintend it as soon as it be receive it shall be communicate to congress many patriotic and enlighten citizen who have make the subject an object of particular investigation have suggest an improvement of still great importance they be of the opinion that the water of the chesapeake and ohio may be connect together by one continued canal and at an expense far short of the value and importance of the object to be obtain if this could be accomplish it be impossible to calculate the beneficial consequence which would result from it a great portion of the produce of the very fertile country through which it would pass would find a market through that channel troop might be move with great facility in war with cannon and every kind of munition and in either direction connect the atlantic with the western country in a line pass through the seat of the national government it would contribute essentially to strengthen the bond of union itself believe as i do that congress possess the right to appropriate money for such a national object the jurisdiction remain to the states through which the canal would pass i submit it to your consideration whether it may not be advisable to authorize by an adequate appropriation the employment of a suitable number of the officer of the corps of engineers to examine the unexplored ground during the next season and to report their opinion thereon it will likewise be proper to extend their examination to the several route through which the water of the ohio may be connect by canal with those of lake erie as the cumberland road will require annual repair and congress have not think it expedient to recommend to the states an amendment to the constitution for the purpose of vest in the united states a power to adopt and execute a system of internal improvement it be also submit to your consideration whether it may not be expedient to authorize the executive to enter into an arrangement with the several states through which the road pass to establish toll each within its limit for the purpose of defray the expense of future repair and of provide also by suitable penalty for its protection against future injury the act of congress of 1822 05 07 appropriate the sum of $ 22,700 for the purpose of erect two pier as a shelter for vessel from ice near cape henlopen delaware bay to effect the object of the act the officer of the board of engineers with commodore bainbridge be direct to prepare plan and estimate of pier sufficient to answer the purpose intend by the act it appear by their report which accompany the document from the war department that the appropriation be not adequate to the purpose intend and as the pier would be of great service both to the navigation of the delaware bay and the protection of vessel on the adjacent part of the coast i submit for the consideration of congress whether additional and sufficient appropriation should not be make the board of engineers be also direct to examine and survey the entrance of the harbor of the port of presquille in pa in order to make an estimate of the expense of remove the obstruction to the entrance with a plan of the good mode of effecting the same under the appropriation for that purpose by act of congress pass 3rd of march last the report of the board accompany the paper from the war department and be submit for the consideration of congress a strong hope have be long entertain found on the heroic struggle of the greeks that they would succeed in their contest and resume their equal station among the nation of the earth it be believe that the whole civilized world take a deep interest in their welfare although no power have declare in their favor yet none accord to our information have take part against they their cause and their name have protect they from danger which might ere this have overwhelm any other people the ordinary calculation of interest and of acquisition with a view to aggrandizement which mingle so much in the transaction of nation seem to have have no effect in regard to they from the fact which have come to our knowledge there be good cause to believe that their enemy have lose forever all dominion over they that greece will become again an independent nation that she may obtain that rank be the object of our most ardent wish it be state at the commencement of the last session that a great effort be then make in spain and portugal to improve the condition of the people of those country and that it appear to be conduct with extraordinary moderation it need scarcely be remark that the result have be so far very different from what be then anticipate of event in that quarter of the globe with which we have so much intercourse and from which we derive our origin we have always be anxious and interested spectator the citizen of the united states cherish sentiment the most friendly in favor of the liberty and happiness of their fellow man on that side of the atlantic in the war of the european power in matter relate to themselves we have never take any part nor do it comport with our policy so to do it be only when our right be invade or seriously menace that we resent injury or make preparation for our defense with the movement in this hemisphere we be of necessity more immediately connect and by cause which must be obvious to all enlightened and impartial observer the political system of the allied power be essentially different in this respect from that of america this difference proceed from that which exist in their respective government and to the defense of our own which have be achieve by the loss of so much blood and treasure and mature by the wisdom of their most enlighten citizen and under which we have enjoy unexampled felicity this whole nation be devote we owe it therefore to candor and to the amicable relation exist between the united states and those power to declare that we should consider any attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety with the exist colony or dependency of any european power we have not interfere and shall not interfere but with the government who have declare their independence and maintain it and whose independence we have on great consideration and on just principle acknowledge we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppress they or control in any other manner their destiny by any european power in any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the united states in the war between those new government and spain we declare our neutrality at the time of their recognition and to this we have adhere and shall continue to adhere provide no change shall occur which in the judgment of the competent authority of this government shall make a corresponding change on the part of the united states indispensable to their security the late event in spain and portugal shew that europe be still unsettled of this important fact no strong proof can be adduce than that the allied power should have think it proper on any principle satisfactory to themselves to have interpose by force in the internal concern of spain to what extent such interposition may be carry on the same principle be a question in which all independent power whose government differ from theirs be interested even those most remote and surely none more so than the united states our policy in regard to europe which be adopt at an early stage of the war which have so long agitated that quarter of the globe nevertheless remain the same which be not to interfere in the internal concern of any of its power to consider the government de facto as the legitimate government for we to cultivate friendly relation with it and to preserve those relation by a frank firm and manly policy meet in all instance the just claim of every power submit to injury from none but in regard to those continent circumstance be eminently and conspicuously different it be impossible that the allied power should extend their political system to any portion of either continent without endanger our peace and happiness nor can anyone believe that our southern brother if leave to themselves would adopt it of their own accord it be equally impossible therefore that we should behold such interposition in any form with indifference if we look to the comparative strength and resource of spain and those new government and their distance from each other it must be obvious that she can never subdue they it be still the true policy of the united states to leave the party to themselves in the hope that other power will pursue the same course if we compare the present condition of our union with its actual state at the close of our revolution the history of the world furnish no example of a progress in improvement in all the important circumstance which constitute the happiness of a nation which bear any resemblance to it at the first epoch our population do not exceed 3,000,000 by the last census it amount to about 10,000,000 and what be more extraordinary it be almost altogether native for the immigration from other country have be inconsiderable at the first epoch half the territory within our acknowledge limit be uninhabited and a wilderness since then new territory have be acquire of vast extent comprise within it many river particularly the mississippi the navigation of which to the ocean be of the high importance to the original state over this territory our population have expand in every direction and new states have be establish almost equal in number to those which form the first bond of our union this expansion of our population and accession of new states to our union have have the happy effect on all its high interest that it have eminently augment our resource and add to our strength and respectability as a power be admit by all but it be not in these important circumstance only that this happy effect be feel it be manifest that by enlarge the basis of our system and increase the number of states the system itself have be greatly strengthen in both its branch consolidation and disunion have thereby be render equally impracticable each government confide in its own strength have less to apprehend from the other and in consequence each enjoy a great freedom of action be render more efficient for all the purpose for which it be institute it be unnecessary to treat here of the vast improvement make in the system itself by the adoption of this constitution and of its happy effect in elevate the character and in protect the right of the nation as well as individual to what then do we owe these blessing it be know to all that we derive they from the excellence of our institution ought we not then to adopt every measure which may be necessary to perpetuate they
fellow citizen of the senate and house of representatives the view which i have now to present to you of our affair foreign and domestic realize the most sanguine anticipation which have be entertain of the public prosperity if we look to the whole our growth as a nation continue to be rapid beyond example if to the state which compose it the same gratifying spectacle be exhibit our expansion over the vast territory within our limit have be great without indicate any decline in those section from which the emigration have be most conspicuous we have daily gain strength by a native population in every quarter&mdash;a population devote to our happy system of government and cherish the bond of union with internal affection experience have already shew that the difference of climate and of industry proceed from that cause inseparable from such vast domain and which under other system might have a repulsive tendency can not fail to produce with we under wise regulation the opposite effect what one portion want the other may supply and this will be most sensibly feel by the part most distant from each other form thereby a domestic market and an active intercourse between the extreme and throughout every portion of our union thus by a happy distribution of power between the national and state government government which rest exclusively on the sovereignty of the people and be fully adequate to the great purpose for which they be respectively institute cause which might otherwise lead to dismemberment operate powerfully to draw we close together in every other circumstance a correct view of the actual state of our union must be equally gratifying to our constituent our relation with foreign power be of a friendly character although certain interesting difference remain unsettled with some   our revenue under the mild system of impost and tonnage continue to be adequate to all the purpose of the government   our agriculture commerce manufacture and navigation flourish   our fortification be advance in the degree authorize by exist appropriation to maturity and due progress be make in the augmentation of the navy to the limit prescribe for it by law   for these blessing we owe to almighty god from whom we derive they and with profound reverence our most grateful and unceasing acknowledgment   in advert to our relation with foreign power which be always an object of the high importance i have to remark that of the subject which have be bring into discussion with they during the present administration some have be satisfactorily terminate other have be suspend to be resume hereafter under circumstance more favorable to success and other be still in negotiation with the hope that they may be adjust with mutual accommodation to the interest and to the satisfaction of the respective party it have be the invariable object of this government to cherish the most friendly relation with every power and on principle and condition which might make they permanent a systematic effort have be make to place our commerce with each power on a footing of perfect reciprocity to settle with each in a spirit of candor and liberality all exist difference and to anticipate and remove so far as it might be practicable all cause of future variance it having be stipulate by the seventh article of the convention of navigation and commerce which be conclude on 1822 06 24 between the united states and france that the say convention should continue in force for two year from the first of october of that year and for an indefinite term afterwards unless one of the party should declare its intention to renounce it in which event it should cease to operate at the end of six month from such declaration and no such intention having be announce the convention having be find advantageous to both party it have since remain and still remain in force at the time when that convention be conclude many interesting subject be leave unsettled and particularly our claim to indemnity for spoliation which be commit on our commerce in the late war for these interest and claim it be in the contemplation of the party to make provision at a subsequent day by a more comprehensive and definitive treaty the object have be duly attend to since by the executive but as yet it have not be accomplish it be hope that a favorable opportunity will present itself for open a negotiation which may embrace and arrange all exist difference and every other concern in which they have a common interest upon the accession of the present king of france an event which have occur since the close of the last session of congress with great britain our commercial intercourse rest on the same footing that it do at the last session by the convention of 1815 the commerce between the united states and the british dominion in europe and the east indies be arrange on a principle of reciprocity that convention be confirm and continue in force with slight exception by a subsequent treaty for the term of 10 year from 1818 10 20 the date of the latter the trade with the british colony in the west indies have not as yet be arrange by treaty or otherwise to our satisfaction an approach to that result have be make by legislative act whereby many serious impediment which have be raise by the party in defense of their respective claim be remove an earnest desire exist and have be manifest on the part of this government to place the commerce with the colony likewise on a footing of reciprocal advantage and it be hope that the british government see the justice of the proposal and its importance to the colony will ere long accede to it the commissioner who be appoint for the adjustment of the boundary between the territory of the united states and those of great britain specify in the fifth article of the treaty of ghent having disagree in their decision and both government having agree to establish that boundary by amicable negotiation between they it be hope that it may be satisfactorily adjust in that mode the boundary specify by the sixth article have be establish by the decision of the commissioner from the progress make in that provide for by the seventh accord to a report recently receive there be good cause to presume that it will be settle in the course of the ensue year it be a cause of serious regret that no arrangement have yet be finally conclude between the two government to secure by joint cooperation the suppression of the slave trade it be the object of the british government in the early stage of the negotiation to adopt a plan for the suppression which should include the concession of the mutual right of search by the ship of war of each party of the vessel of the other for suspect offender this be object to by this government on the principle that as the right of search be a right of war of a belligerent toward a neutral power it might have an ill effect to extend it by treaty to an offense which have be make comparatively mild to a time of peace anxious however for the suppression of this trade it be think advisable in compliance with a resolution of the house of representatives found on an act of congress to propose to the british government an expedient which should be free from that objection and more effectual for the object by make it piratical in that mode the enormity of the crime would place the offender out of the protection of their government and involve no question of search or other question between the party touch their respective right it be believe also that it would completely suppress the trade in the vessel of both party and by their respective citizen and subject in those of other power with whom it be hope that the odium which would thereby be attach to it would produce a corresponding arrangement and by mean thereof its entire extirpation forever a convention to this effect be conclude and sign in london on 1824 03 13 by plenipotentiary duly authorize by both government to the ratification of which certain obstacle have arise which be not yet entirely remove the difference between the party still remain have be reduce to a point not of sufficient magnitude as be presume to be permit to defeat an object so near to the heart of both nation and so desirable to the friend of humanity throughout the world as objection however to the principle recommend by the house of representatives or at least to the consequence inseparable from it and which be understand to apply to the law have be raise which may deserve a reconsideration of the whole subject i have think it proper to suspend the conclusion of a new convention until the definitive sentiment of congress may be ascertain the document relate to the negotiation be with that intent submit to your consideration our commerce with sweden have be place on a footing of perfect reciprocity by treaty and with russia the netherlands prussia the free hanseatic city the dukedom of oldenburg and sardinia by internal regulation on each side found on mutual agreement between the respective government the principle upon which the commercial policy of the united states be found be to be trace to an early period they be essentially connect with those upon which their independence be declare and owe their origin to the enlightened man who take the lead in our affair at that important epoch they be develop in their first treaty of commerce with france of 1778 02 06 and by a formal commission which be institute immediately after the conclusion of their revolutionary struggle for the purpose of negotiate treaty of commerce with every european power the first treaty of the united states with prussia which be negotiate by that commission afford a signal illustration of those principle the act of congress of 1815 03 03 adopt immediately after the return of a general peace be a new overture to foreign nation to establish our commercial relation with they on the basis of free and equal reciprocity that principle have pervade all the act of congress and all the negotiation of the executive on the subject a convention for the settlement of important question in relation to the north west coast of this continent and its adjoining sea be conclude and sign at st. petersburg on the 5th day of april last by the minister plenipotentiary of the united states and plenipotentiary of the imperial government of russia it will immediately be lay before the senate for the exercise of the constitutional authority of that body with reference to its ratification it be proper to add that the manner in which this negotiation be invite and conduct on the part of the emperor have be very satisfactory the great and extraordinary change which have happen in the government of spain and portugal within the last two year without seriously affect the friendly relation which under all of they have be maintain with those power by the united states have be obstacle to the adjustment of the particular subject of discussion which have arise with each a resolution of the senate adopt at their last session call for information as to the effect produce upon our relation with spain by the recognition on the part of the united states of the independent south american government the paper contain that information be now communicate to congress a charge d'affaire have be receive from the independent government of brazil that country heretofore a colonial possession of portugal have some year since be proclaim by the sovereign of portugal himself an independent kingdom since his return to lisbon a revolution in brazil have establish a new government there with an imperial title at the head of which be place a prince in whom the regency have be vest by the king at the time of his departure there be reason to expect that by amicable negotiation the independence of brazil will ere long be recognize by portugal herself with the remain power of europe with those on the coast of barbary and with all the new south american state our relation be of a friendly character we have minister plenipotentiary reside with the republics of colombia and chile and have receive minister of the same rank from columbia guatemala buenos aires and mexico our commercial relation with all those state be mutually beneficial and increase with the republic of colombia a treaty of commerce have be form of which a copy be receive and the original daily expect a negotiation for a like treaty would have be commence with buenos aires have it not be prevent by the indisposition and lamented decease of mr. rodney our minister there and to whose memory the most respectful attention have be shew by the government of that republic an advantageous alteration in our treaty with tunis have be obtain by our consular agent reside there the official document of which when receive will be lay before the senate the attention of the government have be draw with great solicitude to other subject and particularly to that relate to a state of maritime war involve the relative right of neutral and belligerent in such war most of the difficulty which we have experience and of the loss which we have sustain since the establishment of our independence have proceed from the unsettled state of those right and the extent to which the belligerent claim have be carry against the neutral party it be impossible to look back on the occurrence of the late war in europe and to behold the disregard which be pay to our right as a neutral power and the waste which be make of our commerce by the party to those war by various act of their respective government and under the pretext by each that the other have set the example without great mortification and a fix purpose never to submit to the like in future an attempt to remove those cause of possible variance by friendly negotiation and on just principle which should be applicable to all party could it be presume be view by none other than as a proof of an earnest desire to preserve those relation with every power in the late war between france and spain a crisis occur in which it seem probable that all controvertible principle involve in such war might be bring into discussion and settle to the satisfaction of all party proposition have this object in view have be make to the government of great britain france russia and of other power which have be receive in a friendly manner by all but as yet no treaty have be form with either for its accomplishment the policy will it be presume be persevere in and in the hope that it may be successful it will always be recollect that with one of the party to those war and from whom we receive those injury we seek redress by war from the other by whose then reign government our vessel be seize in port as well as at sea and their cargo confiscate indemnity have be expect but have not yet be render it be under the influence of the latter that our vessel be likewise seize by the government of spain holland denmark sweden and naples and from whom indemnity have be claim and be still expect with the exception of spain by whom it have be render with both party we have abundant cause of war but we have no alternative but to resist that which be most powerful at sea and press we near at home with this all difference be settle by a treaty found on condition fair and honorable to both and which have be so far execute with perfect good faith it have be earnestly hope that the other would of its own accord and from a sentiment of justice and conciliation make to our citizen the indemnity to which they be entitle and thereby remove from our relation any just cause of discontent on our side it be estimate that the receipt into the treasury during the current year exclusive of loan will exceed $ 18.5 million which with the sum remain in the treasury at the end of the last year amount to $ 9,463,922.81 will after discharge the current disbursement of the year the interest on the public debt and upward of $ 11,633,011.52 of the principal leave a balance of more than $ 3 million in the treasury on the first day of january next a large amount of the debt contract during the late war bear an interest of 6 percent become redeemable in the course of the ensue year than could be discharge by the ordinary revenue the act of the 26th of may authorize a loan of $ 5 million at 4.5 percent to meet the same by this arrangement an annual saving will accrue to the public of $ 75,000.under the act of the 24th of may last a loan of $ 5 million be authorize in order to meet the award under the florida treaty which be negotiate at par with the bank of the united states at 4.5 percent the limit of interest fix by the act by this provision the claim of our citizen who have sustain so great a loss by spoliation and from whom indemnity have be so long withhold be promptly pay for these advance the public will be amply repay at no distant day by the sale of the land in florida of the great advantage result from the acquisition of the territory in other respect too high an estimate can not be form it be estimate that the receipt into the treasury during the year 1825 will be sufficient to meet the disbursement of the year include the sum of $ 10 million which be annually appropriate by the act of constitute the sink fund to the payment of the principal and interest of the public debt the whole amount of the public debt on the first of january next may be estimate at $ 86 million inclusive of $ 2.5 million of the loan authorize by the act of the 26th of may last in this estimate be include a stock of $ 7 million issue for the purchase of that amount of the capital stock of the bank of the united states and which as the stock of the bank still hold by the government will at least be fully equal to its reimbursement ought not to be consider as constitute a part of the public debt estimating then the whole amount of the public debt at $ 79 million and regard the annual receipt and expenditure of the government a well found hope may be entertain that should no unexpected event occur the whole of the public debt may be discharge in the course of 10 year and the government be leave at liberty thereafter to apply such portion of the revenue as may not be necessary for current expense to such other object as may be most conducive to the public security and welfare that the sum applicable to these object will be very considerable may be fairly conclude when it be recollect that a large amount of the public revenue have be apply since the late war   to the construction of the public building in this city   to the erection of fortification along the coast and of arsenal in different part of the union   to the augmentation of the navy   to the extinguishment of the indian title to large tract of fertile territory   to the acquisition of florida   to pension to revolutionary officer and soldier and to invalid of the late war on many of these object the expense will annually be diminish and cease at no distant period on most of they on the 1917 01 01 the public debt amount to $ 123,491,965.16 and notwithstanding the large sum which have be apply to these object it have be reduce since that period $ 37,446,961.78 the last portion of the public debt will be redeemable on 1835 01 01 and while there be the good reason to believe that the resource of the government will be continually adequate to such portion of it as may become due in the interval it be recommend to congress to seize every opportunity which may present itself to reduce the rate of interest on every part thereof the high state of the public credit and the great abundance of money be at this time very favorable to such a result it must be very gratifying to our fellow citizen to witness this flourish state of the public finance when it be recollect that no burthen whatever have be impose upon they the military establishment in all its branch in the performance of the various duty assign to each justify the favorable view which be present of the efficiency of its organization at the last session all the appropriation have be regularly apply to the object intend by congress and so far as the disbursement have be make the account have be render and settle without loss to the public the condition of the army itself as relate to the officer and man in science and discipline be highly respectable the military academy on which the army essentially rest and to which it be much indebted for this state of improvement have attain in comparison with any other institution of a like kind a high degree of perfection experience however have shew that the dispersed condition of the corps of artillery be unfavorable to the discipline of that important branch of the military establishment to remedy this inconvenience eleven company have be assemble at the fortification erect at old point comfort as a school for artillery instruction with intention as they shall be perfect in the various duty of that service to order they to other post and to supply their place with other company for instruction in like manner in this mode a complete knowledge of the science and duty of this arm will be extend throughout the whole corps of artillery but to carry this object fully into effect will require the aid of congress to obtain which the subject be now submit to your consideration of the progress which have be make in the construction of fortification for the permanent defense of our maritime frontier accord to the plan decide on and to the extent of the exist appropriation the report of the secretary of war which be herewith communicate will give a detailed account their final completion can not fail to give great additional security to that frontier and to diminish proportionably the expense of defend it in the event of war the provision in several act of congress of the last session for the improvement of the navigation of the mississippi and the ohio of the harbor of presqu'isle on lake erie and the repair of the plymouth beach be in a course of regular execution and there be reason to believe that the appropriation in each instance will be adequate to the object to carry these improvement fully into effect the superintendence of they have be assign to officer of the corps of engineers under the act of 30th april last authorize the president to cause a survey to be make with the necessary plan and estimate of such road and canal as he might deem of national importance in a commercial or military point of view or for the transportation of the mail a board have be institute consist of two distinguished officer of the corps of engineers and a distinguished civil engineer with assistant who have be actively employ in carry into effect the object of the act they have carefully examine the route between the potomac and the ohio river between the latter and lake erie between the alleghany and the susquehannah and the route between the delaware and the raritan barnstable and buzzards bay and between boston harbor and narraganset bay such portion of the corps of topographical engineers as could be spare from the survey of the coast have be employ in survey the very important route between the potomac and the ohio considerable progress have be make in it but the survey can not be complete until the next season it be gratify to add from the view already take that there be good cause to believe that this great national object may be fully accomplish it be contemplate to commence early in the next season the execution of the other branch of the act&mdash;that which relate to roads&mdash;and with the survey of a route from this city through the southern state to new orleans the importance of which can not be too highly estimate all the officer of both the corp of engineer who could be spare from other service have be employ in explore and survey the route for canal to digest a plan for both object for the great purpose specify will require a thorough knowledge of every part of our union and of the relation of each part to the other and of all to the seat of the general government for such a digest it will be necessary that the information be full minute and precise with a view to these important object i submit to the consideration of the congress the propriety of enlarge both the corps of engineers&mdash;the military and topographical it need scarcely be remark that the more extensively these corp be engage in the improvement of their country in the execution of the power of congress and in aid of the state in such improvement as lie beyond that limit when such aid be desire the happy the effect will be in many view of which the subject be perceptible by profit of their science the work will always be well execute and by give to the officer such employment our union will derive all the advantage in peace as well as in war from their talent and service which they can afford in this mode also the military will be incorporate with the civil and unfounded and injurious distinction and prejudice of every kind be do away to the corps themselves this service can not fail to be equally useful since by the knowledge they would thus acquire they would be eminently well qualified in the event of war for the great purpose for which they be institute our relation with the indian tribe within our limit have not be materially change during the year the hostile disposition evince by certain tribe on the missouri during the last year still continue and have extend in some degree to those on the upper mississippi and the upper lakes several party of our citizen have be plunder and murder by those tribe in order to establish relation of friendship with they congress at the last session make an appropriation for treaty with they and for the employment of a suitable military escort to accompany and attend the commissioner at the place appoint for the negotiation this object have not be effect the season be too far advanced when the appropriation be make and the distance too great to permit it but measure have be take and all the preparation will be complete to accomplish it at an early period in the next season believe that the hostility of the tribe particularly on the upper mississippi and the lakes be in no small degree owe to the war which be carry on between the tribe reside in that quarter measure have be take to bring about a general peace among they which if successful will not only tend to the security of our citizen but be of great advantage to the indians themselves with the exception of the tribe refer to our relation with all the other be on the same friendly footing and it afford i great satisfaction to add that they be make steady advance in civilization and the improvement of their condition many of the tribe have already make great progress in the art of civilized life this desirable result have be bring about by the humane and persevere policy of the government and particularly by mean of the appropriation for the civilization of the indians there have be establish under the provision of this act 32 school contain 916 scholar who be well instruct in several branch of literature and likewise in agriculture and the ordinary art of life under the appropriation to authorize treaty with the creeks and quaupaw indians commissioner have be appoint and negotiation be now pende but the result be not yet know for more full information respect the principle which have be adopt for carry into effect the act of congress authorize survey with plan and estimate for canal and road and on every other branch of duty incident to the department of war i refer you to the report of the secretary the squadron in the mediterranean have be maintain in the extent which be propose in the report of the secretary of the navy of the last year and have afford to our commerce the necessary protection in that sea apprehending however that the unfriendly relation which have exist between algiers and some of the power of europe might be extend to we it have be think expedient to augment the force there and in consequence the north carolina a ship of the line have be prepare and will sail in a few day to join it the force employ in the gulf of mexico and in the neighboring sea for the suppression of piracy have likewise be preserve essentially in the state in which it be during the last year a persevering effort have be make for the accomplishment of that object and much protection have thereby be afford to our commerce but still the practice be far from be suppress from every view which have be take of the subject it be think that it will be necessary rather to augment than to diminish our force in that quarter there be reason to believe that the piracy now complain of be commit by band of robber who inhabit the land and who by preserve good intelligence with the town and seize favorable opportunity rush forth and fall on unprotected merchant vessel of which they make an easy prey the pillage thus take they carry to their lurking place and dispose of afterwards at price tend to seduce the neighboring population this combination be understand to be of great extent and be the more to be deprecate because the crime of piracy be often attend with the murder of the crew these robber know if any survive their lurking place would be expose and they be catch and punish that this atrocious practice should be carry to such extent be cause of equal surprise and regret it be presume that it must be attribute to the relaxed and feeble state of the local government since it be not doubt from the high character of the governor of cuba who be well known and much respect here that if he have the power he would promptly suppress it whether those robber should be pursue on the land the local authority be make responsible for these atrocity or any other measure be resort to to suppress they be submit to the consideration of congress in execution of the law for the suppression of the slave trade a vessel have be occasionally send from that squadron to the coast of africa with order to return thence by the usual track of the slave ship and to seize any of our vessel which might be engage in that trade none have be find and it be believe that none be thus employ it be well know however that the trade still exist under other flag the health of our squadron while at thompsons island have be much well during the present than it be the last season some improvement have be make and other be contemplate there which it be believe will have a very salutary effect on the pacific our commerce have much increase and on that coast as well as on that sea the united states have many important interest which require attention and protection it be think that all the consideration which suggest the expediency of place a squadron on that sea operate with augmented force for maintain it there at least in equal extent for detailed information respect the state of our maritime force on each sea the improvement necessary to be make on either in the organization of the naval establishment generally and of the law for its well government i refer you to the report of the secretary of the navy which be herewith communicate the revenue of the post office department have receive a considerable augmentation in the present year the current receipt will exceed the expenditure although the transportation of the mail within the year have be much increase a report of the postmaster general which be transmit will furnish in detail the necessary information respect the administration and present state of this department in conformity with a resolution of congress of the last session an invitation be give to general lafayette to visit the united states with an assurance that a ship of war should attend at any port of france which he might designate to receive and convey he across the atlantic whenever it might be convenient for he to sail he decline the offer of the public ship from motive of delicacy but assure i that he have long intend and would certainly visit our union in the course of the present year in august last he arrive at new york where he be receive with the warmth of affection and gratitude to which his very important and disinterested service and sacrifice in our revolutionary struggle so eminently entitle he a correspond sentiment have since be manifest in his favor throughout every portion of our union and affectionate invitation have be give he to extend his visit to they to these he have yield all the accommodation in his power at every designate point of rendezvous the whole population of the neighboring country have be assemble to greet he among whom it have excite in a peculiar manner the sensibility of all to behold the survive member of our revolutionary contest civil and military who have share with he in the toil and danger of the war many of they in a decrepit state a more interesting spectacle it be believe be never witness because none could be found on purer principle none proceed from high or more disinterested motive that the feeling of those who have fight and bleed with he in a common cause should have be much excited be natural there be however circumstance attend these interview which pervade the whole community and touch the breast of every age even the young among we there be not an individual present who have not some relative who have not partake in those scene nor an infant who have not hear the relation of they but the circumstance which be most sensibly feel and which his presence bring forcibly to the recollection of all be the great cause in which we be engage and the blessing which we have derive from our success in it the struggle be for independence and liberty public and personal and in this we succeed the meeting with one who have bear so distinguish a part in that great struggle and from such lofty and disinterested motive could not fail to affect profoundly every individual and of every age it be natural that we should all take a deep interest in his future welfare as we do his high claim on our union be feel and the sentiment universal that they should be meet in a generous spirit under these impression i invite your attention to the subject with a view that regard his very important service loss and sacrifice a provision may be make and tender to he which shall correspond with the sentiment and be worthy the character of the american people in turn our attention to the condition of the civilized world in which the united states have always take a deep interest it be gratify to see how large a portion of it be bless with peace the only war which now exist within that limit be those between turkey and greece in europe and between spain and the new government our neighbor in this hemisphere in both these war the cause of independence of liberty and humanity continue to prevail the success of greece when the relative population of the contend party be consider command our admiration and applause and that it have have a similar effect with the neighbor power be obvious the feeling of the whole civilized world be excited in a high degree in their favor may we not hope that these sentiment win on the heart of their respective government may lead to a more decisive result that they may produce an accord among they to replace greece on the ground which she formerly hold and to which her heroic exertion at this day so eminently entitle her?with respect to the contest to which our neighbor be a party it be evident that spain as a power be scarcely feel in it these new state have completely achieve their independence before it be acknowledge by the united states and they have since maintain it with little foreign pressure the disturbance which have appear in certain portion of that vast territory have proceed from internal cause which have their origin in their former government and have not yet be thoroughly remove it be manifest that these cause be daily lose their effect and that these new state be settle down under government elective and representative in every branch similar to our own in this course we ardently wish they to persevere under a firm conviction that it will promote their happiness in this their career however we have not interfere believe that every people have a right to institute for themselves the government which in their judgment may suit they well our example be before they of the good effect of which be our neighbor they be competent judge and to their judgment we leave it in the expectation that other power will pursue the same policy the deep interest which we take in their independence which we have acknowledge and in their enjoyment of all the right incident thereto especially in the very important one of institute their own government have be declare and be know to the world separate as we be from europe by the great atlantic ocean we can have no concern in the war of the european government nor in the cause which produce they the balance of power between they into whichever scale it may turn in its various vibration can not affect we it be the interest of the united states to preserve the most friendly relation with every power and on condition fair equal and applicable to all but in regard to our neighbor our situation be different it be impossible for the european government to interfere in their concern especially in those allude to which be vital without affect we indeed the motive which might induce such interference in the present state of the war between the party if a war it may be call would appear to be equally applicable to we it be gratify to know that some of the power with whom we enjoy a very friendly intercourse and to whom these view have be communicate have appear to acquiesce in they the augmentation of our population with the expansion of our union and increase number of state have produce effect in certain branch of our system which merit the attention of congress some of our arrangement and particularly the judiciary establishment be make with a view to the original 13 state only since then the united states have acquire a vast extent of territory eleven new state have be admit into the union and territory have be lay off for three other which will likewise be admit at no distant day an organization of the supreme court which assign the judge any portion of the duty which belong to the inferior require their passage over so vast a space under any distribution of the state that may now be make if not impracticable in the execution must render it impossible for they to discharge the duty of either branch with advantage to the union the duty of the supreme court would be of great importance if its decision be confine to the ordinary limit of other tribunal but when it be consider that this court decide and in the last resort on all the great question which arise under our constitution involve those between the united states individually between the state and the united states and between the latter and foreign power too high an estimate of their importance can not be form the great interest of the nation seem to require that the judge of the supreme court should be exempt from every other duty than those which be incident to that high trust the organization of the inferior court would of course be adapt to circumstance it be presume that such an one might be form as would secure an able and faithful discharge of their duty and without any material augmentation of expense the condition of the aborigine within our limit and especially those who be within the limit of any of the state merit likewise particular attention experience have show that unless the tribe be civilized they can never be incorporate into our system in any form whatever it have likewise show that in the regular augmentation of our population with the extension of our settlement their situation will become deplorable if their extinction be not menace some well digest plan which will rescue they from such calamity be due to their right to the right of humanity and to the honor of the nation their civilization be indispensable to their safety and this can be accomplish only by degree the process must commence with the infant state through whom some effect may be work on the parental difficulty of the most serious character present themselves to the attainment of this very desirable result on the territory on which they now reside to remove they from it by force even with a view to their own security and happiness would be revolt to humanity and utterly unjustifiable between the limit of our present state and territory and the rocky mountains and mexico there be a vast territory to which they might be invite with inducement which might be successful it be think if that territory should be divide into district by previous agreement with the tribe now reside there and civil government be establish in each with school for every branch of instruction in literature and the art of civilized life that all the tribe now within our limit might gradually be draw there the execution of this plan would necessarily be attend with expense and that not inconsiderable but it be doubted whether any other can be devise which would be less liable to that objection or more likely to succeed in look to the interest which the united states have on the pacific ocean and on the western coast of this continent the propriety of establish a military post at the mouth of the columbia river or at some other point in that quarter within our acknowledge limit be submit to the consideration of congress our commerce and fishery on that sea and along the coast have much increase and be increase it be think that a military post to which our ship of war might resort would afford protection to every interest and have a tendency to conciliate the tribe to the northwest with whom our trade be extensive it be think also that by the establishment of such a post the intercourse between our western state and territory and the pacific and our trade with the tribe reside in the interior on each side of the rocky mountains would be essentially promote to carry this object into effect the appropriation of an adequate sum to authorize the employment of a frigate with an officer of the corps of engineers to explore the mouth of the columbia river and the coast contiguous thereto to enable the executive to make such establishment at the most suitable point be recommend to congress it be think that attention be also due to the improvement of this city the communication between the public building and in various other part and the ground around those building require it it be presume also that the completion of the canal from the tiber to the eastern branch would have a very salutary effect great exertion have be make and expense incur by the citizen in improvement of various kind but those which be suggest belong exclusively to the government or be of a nature to require expenditure beyond their resource the public lot which be still for sale would it be not doubt be more than adequate for these purpose from the view above present it be manifest that the situation of the united states be in the high degree prosperous and happy there be no object which as a people we can desire which we do not possess or which be not within our reach bless with government the happy which the world ever know with no distinct order in society or divided interest in any portion of the vast territory over which their dominion extend we have every motive to cle together which can animate a virtuous and enlightened people the great object be to preserve these blessing and to hand they down to the late posterity our experience ought to satisfy we that our progress under the most correct and provident policy will not be exempt from danger our institution form an important epoch in the history of the civilized world on their preservation and in their utmost purity everything will depend extend as our interest do to every part of the inhabited globe and to every sea to which our citizen be carry by their industry and enterprise to which they be invite by the want of other and have a right to go we must either protect they in the enjoyment of their right or abandon they in certain event to waste and desolation our attitude be highly interesting as relate to other power and particularly to our southern neighbor we have duty to perform wrt all to which we must be faithful to every kind of danger we should pay the most vigilant and uncease attention remove the cause where it may be practicable and be prepared to meet it when inevitable against foreign danger the policy of the government seem to be already settle the event of the late war admonish we to make our maritime frontier impregnable by a well digest chain of fortification and to give efficient protection to our commerce by augment our navy to a certain extent which have be steadily pursue and which it be incumbent upon we to complete as soon as circumstance will permit in the event of war it be on the maritime frontier that we shall be assail it be in that quarter therefore that we should be prepare to meet the attack it be there that our whole force will be call into action to prevent the destruction of our town and the desolation and pillage of the interior to give full effect to this policy great improvement will be indispensable access to those work by every practicable communication should be make easy and in every direction the intercourse between every part of our union should also be promote and facilitate by the exercise of those power which may comport with a faithful regard to the great principle of our constitution with respect to internal cause those great principle point out with equal certainty the policy to be pursue rest on the people as our government do state and national with well define power it be of the high importance that they severally keep within the limit prescribe to they fulfil that sacred duty it be of equal importance that the movement between they be harmonious and in case of any disagreement should any such occur a calm appeal be make to the people and that their voice be hear and promptly obey both government be institute for the common good we can not fail to prosper while those who make they be attentive to the conduct of their representative and control their measure in the pursuit of these great object let a generous spirit and national view and feeling be indulge and let every part recollect that by cherish that spirit and improve the condition of the other in what relate to their welfare the general interest will not only be promote but the local advantage be reciprocate by all i can not conclude this communication the last of the kind which i shall have to make without recollect with great sensibility and heart feel gratitude the many instance of the public confidence and the generous support which i have receive from my fellow citizen in the various trust with which i have be honor having commence my service in early youth and continue it since with few and short interval i have witness the great difficulty to which our union have be surmount from the present prosperous and happy state i derive a gratification which i can not express that these blessing may be preserve and perpetuate will be the object of my fervent and uncease prayer to the supreme ruler of the universe
