military force of the union by land and sea a coordinate department of the judiciary have expound the constitution and the law settle in harmonious coincidence with the legislative will numerous weighty question of construction which the imperfection of human language have render unavoidable the year of jubilee since the first formation of our union have just elapse that of the declaration of our independence be at hand the consummation of both be effect by this constitution since that period a population of four million have multiply to twelve a territory bound by the mississippi have be

the invention of our artist liberty and law have march hand in hand all the purpose of human association have be accomplish as effectively as under any other government on the globe and at a cost little exceed in a whole generation the expenditure of other nation in a single year such be the unexaggerated picture of our condition under a constitution found upon the republican principle of equal right to admit that this picture have its shade be but to say that it be still the condition of man upon earth from evil physical moral and political it be not our claim to be exempt we have suffer sometimes by the visitation of heaven through disease often by the wrong and injustice of other nation even to the extremity of war and lastly by dissension among ourselves dissension perhaps inseparable from the enjoyment of freedom but which have more than once appear to threaten the dissolution of the union and with it the overthrow of all the enjoyment of our present lot and all our earthly hope of the future the cause of these dissension have be various found upon difference of speculation in the theory of republican government upon conflicting view of policy in our relation with foreign nation upon jealousy of partial and sectional interest aggravate by prejudice and prepossession which stranger to each other be ever apt to entertain it be a source of gratification and of encouragement to i to observe that the great result of this experiment upon the theory of human right have at the close of that generation by which it be form be crown with success equal to the most sanguine expectation of its founder union justice tranquillity the common defense the general welfare and the blessing of liberty all have be promote by the government under which we have live stand at this point of time look back to that generation which have go by and forward to that which be advance we may at once indulge in grateful exultation and in cheer hope from the experience of the past we derive instructive lesson for the future of the two great political party which have divide the opinion and feeling of our country the candid and the just will now admit that both have contribute splendid talent spotless integrity ardent patriotism and disintereste sacrifice to the formation and administration of this government and that both have require a liberal indulgence for a portion of human infirmity and error the revolutionary war of europe commence precisely at the moment when the government of the united states first go into operation under this constitution excite a collision of sentiment and of sympathy which kindle all the passion and imbittere the conflict of party till the nation be involve in war and the union be shake to its center this time of trial embrace a period of five and twenty year during which the policy of the union in its relation with europe constitute the principal basis of our political division and the most arduous part of the action of our federal government with the catastrophe in which the war of the french revolution terminate and our own subsequent peace with great britain this baneful weed of party strife be uproot from that time no difference of principle connect either with the theory of government or with our intercourse with foreign nation have exist or be call forth in force sufficient to sustain a continue combination of party or to give more than wholesome animation to public sentiment or legislative debate our political creed be without a dissent voice that can be hear that the will of the people be the source and the happiness of the people the end of all legitimate government upon earth that the good security for the beneficence and the good guaranty against the abuse of power consist in the freedom the purity and the frequency of popular election that the general government of the union and the separate government of the states be all sovereignty of limited power fellow servant of the same master uncontrolle within their respective sphere uncontrollable by encroachment upon each other that the firm security of peace be the preparation during peace of the defense of war that a rigorous economy and accountability of public expenditure should guard against the aggravation and alleviate when possible the burden of taxation that the military should be keep in strict subordination to the civil power that the freedom of the press and of religious opinion should be inviolate that the policy of our country be peace and the ark of our salvation union be article of faith upon which we be all now agree if there have be those who doubt whether a confederate representative democracy be a government competent to the wise and orderly management of the common concern of a mighty nation those doubt have be dispel if there have be project of partial confederacy to be erect upon the ruin of the union they have be scatter to the wind if there have be dangerous attachment to one foreign nation and antipathy against another they have be extinguish ten year of peace at home and abroad have assuage the animosity of political contention and blend into harmony the most discordant element of public opinion there still remain one effort of magnanimity one sacrifice of prejudice and passion to be make by the individual throughout the nation who have heretofore follow the standard of political party it be that of discard every remnant of rancor against each other of embrace as countryman and friend and of yield to talent and virtue alone that confidence which in time of contention for principle be bestow only upon those who bear the badge of party communion the collision of party spirit which originate in speculative opinion or in different view of administrative policy be in their nature transitory those which be found on geographical division adverse interest of soil climate and mode of domestic life be more permanent and therefore perhaps more dangerous it be this which give inestimable value to the character of our government at once federal and national it hold out to we a perpetual admonition to preserve alike and with equal anxiety the right of each individual state in its own government and the right of the whole nation in that of the union whatsoever be of domestic concernment unconnected with the other member of the union or with foreign land belong exclusively to the administration of the state government whatsoever directly involve the right and interest of the federative fraternity or of foreign power be of the resort of this general government the duty of both be obvious in the general principle though sometimes perplex with difficulty in the detail to respect the right of the state government be the inviolable duty of that of the union the government of every state will feel its own obligation to respect and preserve the right of the whole the prejudice everywhere too commonly entertain against distant stranger be wear away and the jealousy of jarring interest be allay by the composition and function of the great national council annually assemble from all quarter of the union at this place here the

magnificence and splendor of their public work be among the imperishable glory of the ancient republic the road and aqueduct of rome have be the admiration of all after age and have survive thousand

i commit with humble but fearless confidence my own fate and the future destiny of my country
to the senate of the united states
 in the message to both houses of congress at the commencement of the session it be mention that the government of the republics of colombia of mexico and of central america have severally invite the government of the united states to be represent at the congress of american nation to be assemble at panama to deliberate upon object of peculiar concernment to this hemisphere and that this invitation have be accept
 although this measure be deem to be within the constitutional competency of the executive i have not think proper to take any step in it before ascertain that my opinion of its expediency will concur with that of both branch of the legislature first by the decision of the senate upon the nomination to be lay before they and secondly by the sanction of both houses to the appropriation without which it can not be carry into effect
 a report from the secretary of state and copy of the correspondence with the south american government on this subject since the invitation give by they be herewith transmit to the senate they will disclose the object of importance which be expect to form a subject of discussion at this meeting in which interest of high importance to this union be involve it will be see that the united states neither intend nor be expect to take part in any deliberation of a belligerent character that the motive of their attendance be neither to contract alliance nor to engage in any undertaking or project import hostility to any other nation
 but the southern american nation in the infancy of their independence often find themselves in position with reference to other country with the principle applicable to which derivable from the state of independence itself they have not be familiarize by experience the result of this have be that sometimes in their intercourse with the united states they have manifest disposition to reserve a right of grant special favor and privilege to the spanish nation as the price of their recognition at other they have actually establish duty and imposition operate unfavorably to the united states to the advantage of other european power and sometimes they have appear to consider that they might interchange among themselves mutual concession of exclusive favor to which neither european power nor the united states should be admit in most of these case their regulation unfavorable to we have yield to friendly expostulation and remonstrance but it be believe to be of infinite moment that the principle of a liberal commercial intercourse should be exhibit to they and urge with disinterested and friendly persuasion upon they when all assemble for the avow purpose of consult together upon the establishment of such principle as may have an important bearing upon their future welfare
 the consentaneous adoption of principle of maritime neutrality and favorable to the navigation of peace and commerce in time of war will also form a subject of consideration to this congress the doctrine that free ship make free good and the restriction of reason upon the extent of blockade may be establish by general agreement with far more ease and perhaps with less danger by the general engagement to adhere to they concert at such a meeting than by partial treaty or convention with each of the nation separately an agreement between all the party represent at the meeting that each will guard by its own mean against the establishment of any future european colony within its border may be find advisable this be more than two year since announce by my predecessor to the world as a principle result from the emancipation of both the american continent it may be so developed to the new southern nation that they will all feel it as an essential appendage to their independence
 there be yet another subject upon which without enter into any treaty the moral influence of the united states may perhaps be exert with beneficial consequence at such a meeting the advancement of religious liberty some of the southern nation be even yet so far under the dominion of prejudice that they have incorporate with their political constitution an exclusive church without toleration of any other than the dominant sect the abandonment of this last badge of religious bigotry and oppression may be press more effectually by the united exertion of those who concur in the principle of freedom of conscience upon those who be yet to be convince of their justice and wisdom than by the solitary effort of a minister to any one of the separate government
 the indirect influence which the united states may exercise upon any project or purpose originate in the war in which the southern republic be still engage which might seriously affect the interest of this union and the good office by which the united states may ultimately contribute to bring that war to a speedy termination though among the motive which have convince i of the propriety of comply with this invitation be so far contingent and eventual that it would be improper to dwell upon they more at large
 in fine a decisive inducement with i for accede to the measure be to show by this token of respect to the southern republics the interest that we take in their welfare and our disposition to comply with their wish having be the first to recognize their independence and sympathize with they so far as be compatible with our neutral duty in all their struggle and suffering to acquire it we have lay the foundation of our future intercourse with they in the broad principle of reciprocity and the most cordial feeling of fraternal friendship to extend those principle to all our commercial relation with they and to hand down that friendship to future age be congenial to the high policy of the union as it will be to that of all those nation and their posterity in the confidence that these sentiment will meet the approbation of the senate i nominate richard c. anderson of kentucky and john sergeant of pennsylvania to be envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the assembly of american nation at panama and william b. rochester of new york to be secretary to the mission

fellow citizen of the senate and of the house of representatives in take a general survey of the concern of our beloved country with reference to subject interesting to the common welfare the first sentiment which impress itself upon the mind be of gratitude to the omnipotent disposer of all good for the continuance of the signal blessing of his providence and especially for that health which to an unusual extent have prevail within our border and for that abundance which in the vicissitude of the season have be scatter with profusion over our land nor ought we less to ascribe to he the glory that we be permit to enjoy the bounty of his hand in peace and tranquillity&mdash;in peace with all the other nation of the earth in tranquillity among our self there have indeed rarely be a period in the history of civilized man in which the general condition of the christian nation have be mark so extensively by peace and prosperity europe with a few partial and unhappy exception have enjoy 10 year of peace during which all her government what ever the theory of their constitution may have be be successively teach to feel that the end of their institution be the happiness of the people and that the exercise of power among man can be justify only by the blessing it confer upon those over whom it be extend during the same period our intercourse with all those nation have be pacific and friendly it so continue since the close of your last session no material variation have occur in our relation with any one of they in the commercial and navigation system of great britain important change of municipal regulation have recently be sanction by act of parliament the effect of which upon the interest of other nation and particularly upon ours have not yet be fully develop in the recent renewal of the diplomatic mission on both side between the two government assurance have be give and receive of the continuance and increase of the mutual confidence and cordiality by which the adjustment of many point of difference have already be effect and which afford the sure pledge for the ultimate satisfactory adjustment of those which still remain open or may hereafter arise the policy of the united states in their commercial intercourse with other nation have always be of the most liberal character in the mutual exchange of their respective production they have abstain altogether from prohibition they have interdict themselves the power of lay taxis upon export and when ever they have favor their own shipping by special preference or exclusive privilege in their own port it have be only with a view to countervail similar favor and exclusion grant by the nation with whom we have be engage in traffic to their own people or shipping and to the disadvantage of our immediately after the close of the last war a proposal be fairly make by the act of congress of 1815 03 03 to all the maritime nation to lay aside the system of retaliate restriction and exclusion and to place the shipping of both party to the common trade on a footing of equality in respect to the duty of tonnage and impost this offer be partially and successively accept by great britain sweden the netherlands the hanseatic city prussia sardinia the duke of oldenburg and russia it be also adopt under certain modification in our late commercial convention with france and by the act of congress of 1824 01 08 it have receive a new confirmation with all the nation who have accede to it and have be offer again to all those who be or may here after be willing to abide in reciprocity by it but all these regulation whether establish by treaty or by municipal enactment be still subject to one important restriction the removal of discriminating duty of tonnage and of impost be limit to article of the growth produce or manufacture of the country to which the vessel belong or to such article as be most usually first ship from her port it will deserve the serious consideration of congress whether even this remnant of restriction may not be safely abandon and whether the general tender of equal competition make in the act of 1824 01 08 may not be extend to include all article of merchandise not prohibit of what country so ever they may be the produce or manufacture proposition of this effect have already be make to we by more than one european government and it be probable that if once establish by legislation or compact with any distinguished maritime state it would recommend itself by the experience of its advantage to the general accession of all the convention of commerce and navigation between the united states and france conclude on 1822 06 24 be in the understanding and intent of both party as appear upon its face only a temporary arrangement of the point of difference between they of the most immediate and press urgency it be limit in the first instance to two year from 1822 10 01 but with a proviso that it should far continue in force til the conclusion of a general and definitive treaty of commerce unless terminate by a notice six month in advance of either of the party to the other its operation so far as it extend have be mutually advantageous and it still continue in force by common consent but it leave unadjuste several object of great interest to the citizen and subject of both country and particularly a mass of claim to considerable amount of citizen of the united states upon the government of france of indemnity for property take or destroy under circumstance of the most aggravated and outrageous character in the long period during which continual and earnest appeal have be make to the equity and magnanimity of france in behalf of these claim their justice have not be as it could not be deny it be hope that the accession of a new sovereign to the throne would have afford a favorable opportunity for present they to the consideration of his government they have be present and urge hither to without effect the repeated and earnest representation of our minister at the court of france remain as yet even without an answer be the demand of nation upon the justice of each other susceptible of adjudication by the sentence of an impartial tribunal those to which i now refer would long since have be settle and adequate indemnity would have be obtain there be large amount of similar claim upon the netherlands naples and denmark for those upon spain prior to 1819 indemnity be after many year of patient forbearance obtain and those upon sweden have be lately compromise by a private settlement in which the claimant themselves have acquiesce the government of denmark and of naples have be recently remind of those yet exist against they nor will any of they be forget while a hope may be indulge of obtain justice by the mean within the constitutional power of the executive and without resort to those mean of self redress which as well as the time circumstance and occasion which may require they be within the exclusive competency of the legislature it be with great satisfaction that i be enable to bear witness to the liberal spirit with which the republic of colombia have make satisfaction for well establish claim of a similar character and among the document now communicate to congress will be distinguish a treaty of commerce and navigation with that republic the ratification of which have be exchange since the last recess of the legislature the negotiation of similar treaty with all of the independent south american state have be contemplate and may yet be accomplish the basis of they all as propose by the united states have be lay in two principles&mdash;the one of entire and unqualified reciprocity the other the mutual obligation of the party to place each other permanently upon the footing of the most favored nation these principle be indeed indispensable to the effectual emancipation of the american hemisphere from the thralldom of colonizing monopoly and exclusion an event rapidly realize in the progress of human affair and which the resistance still oppose in certain part of europe to the acknowledgment of the southern american republic as independent state will it be believe contribute more effectually to accomplish the time have be and that not remote when some of those state might in their anxious desire to obtain a nominal recognition have accept of a nominal independence clog with burdensome condition and exclusive commercial privilege grant to the nation from which they have separate to the disadvantage of all other they be all now aware that such concession to any european nation would be incompatible with that independence which they have declare and maintainedamong the measure which have be suggest to they by the new relation with one another result from the recent change in their condition be that of assemble at the isthmus of panama a congress at which each of they should be represent to deliberate upon object important to the welfare of all the republic of colombia of mexico and of central america have already depute plenipotentiary to such a meeting and they have invite the united states to be also represent there by their minister the invitation have be accept and minister on the part of the united states will be commission to attend at those deliberation and to take part in they so far as may be compatible with that neutrality from which it be neither our intention nor the desire of the other american state that we should depart the commissioner under the seventh article of the treaty of ghent have so nearly complete their arduous labor that by the report recently receive from the agent on the part of the united states there be reason to expect that the commission will be close at their next session appoint for may 22 of the ensue year the other commission appoint to ascertain the indemnity due for slave carry away from the united states after the close of the late war have meet with some difficulty which have delay their progress in the inquiry a reference have be make to the british government on the subject which it may be hope will tend to hasten the decision of the commissioner or serve as a substitute for it among the power specifically grant to congress by the constitution be those of establish uniform law on the subject of bankruptcy throughout the united states and of provide for organize arming and discipline the militia and for govern such part of they as may be employ in the service of the united states the magnitude and complexity of the interest affect by legislation upon these subject may account for the fact that long and often as both of they have occupy the attention and animate the debate of congress no system have yet be devise for fulfil to the satisfaction of the community the duty prescribe by these grant of power to conciliate the claim of the individual citizen to the enjoyment of personal liberty with the effective obligation of private contract be the difficult problem to be solve by a law of bankruptcy these be object of the deep interest to society affect all that be precious in the existence of multitude of person many of they in the class essentially dependent and helpless of the age require nurture and of the sex entitle to protection from the free agency of the parent and the husband the organization of the militia be yet more indispensable to the liberty of the country it be only by an effective militia that we can at once enjoy the repose of peace and bid defiance to foreign aggression it be by the militia that we be constitute an armed nation stand in perpetual panoply of defense in the presence of all the other nation of the earth to this end it would be necessary if possible so to shape its organization as to give it a more united and active energy there be law establish an uniform militia throughout the united states and for arm and equip its whole body but it be a body of dislocated member without the vigor of unity and have little of uniformity but the name to infuse into this most important institution the power of which it be susceptible and to make it available for the defense of the union at the short notice and at the small expense possible of time of life and of treasure be among the benefit to be expect from the persevere deliberation of congress among the unequivocal indication of our national prosperity be the flourish state of our finance the revenue of the present year from all their principal source will exceed the anticipation of the last the balance in the treasury on the first of january last be a little short of $ 2,000,000 exclusive of $ 2,500,000 be the moiety of the loan of $ 5,000,000 authorize by the act of 1824 05 26 the receipt into the treasury from the 1st of january to the 30th of september exclusive of the other moiety of the same loan be estimate at $ 16,500,000 and it be expect that those of the current quarter will exceed $ 5,000,000 form an aggregate of receipt of nearly $ 22,000,000 independent of the loan the expenditure of the year will not exceed that sum more than $ 2,000,000 by those expenditure nearly $ 8,000,000 of the principal of the public debt that have be discharge more than $ 1,500,000 have be devote to the debt of gratitude to the warrior of the revolution a nearly equal sum to the construction of fortification and the acquisition of ordnance and other permanent preparation of national defense $ 500,000 to the gradual increase of the navy an equal sum for purchase of territory from the indians and payment of annuity to they and upward of $ 1,000,000 for object of internal improvement authorize by special act of the last congress if we add to these $ 4,000,000 for payment of interest upon the public debt there remain a sum of $ 7,000,000 which have defray the whole expense of the administration of government in its legislative executive and judiciary department include the support of the military and naval establishment and all the occasional contingency of a government coextensive with the union the amount of duty secure on merchandise import since the commencement of the year be about $ 25,500,000 and that which will accrue during the current quarter be estimate at $ 5,500,000 from these $ 31,000,000 deduct the drawback estimate at less than $ 7,000,000 a sum exceed $ 24,000,000 will constitute the revenue of the year and will exceed the whole expenditure of the year the entire amount of the public debt remain due on the first of january next will be short of $ 81,000,000.by an act of congress of the 3rd of march last a loan of $ 12,000,000 be authorize at 4.5 percent or an exchange of stock to that amount of 4.5 percent for a stock of 6 percent to create a fund for extinguish an equal amount of the public debt bear an interest of 6 percent redeemable in 1826 an account of the measure take to give effect to this act will be lay before you by the secretary of the treasury as the object which it have in view have be but partially accomplish it will be for the consideration of congress whether the power with which it clothe the executive should not be renew at an early day of the present session and under what modification the act of congress of the 3rd of march last direct the secretary of the treasury to subscribe in the name and for the use of the united states for 1,500 share of the capital stock of the chesapeake and delaware canal company have be execute by the actual subscription for the amount specify and such other measure have be adopt by that officer under the act as the fulfillment of its intention require the late account receive of this important undertaking authorize the belief that it be in successful progress the payment into the treasury from the proceed of the sale of the public land during the present year be estimate at $ 1,000,000 the actual receipt of the first two quarter have fall very little short of that sum it be not expect that the second half of the year will be equally productive but the income of the year from that source may now be safely estimate at $ 1,500,000 the act of congress of 1824 05 18 to provide for the extinguishment of the debt due to the united states by the purchaser of public land be limited in its operation of relief to the purchaser to the 10th of april last its effect at the end of the quarter during which it expire be to reduce that debt from $ 10,000,000 to $ 7,000,000 by the operation of similar prior law of relief from and since that of 1821 03 02 the debt have be reduce from upward of $ 22,000,000 to $ 10,000,000.it be exceedingly desirable that it should be extinguish altogether and to facilitate that consummation i recommend to congress the revival for one year more of the act of 1824 05 18 with such provisional modification as may be necessary to guard the public interest against fraudulent practice in the resale of the relinquished land the purchaser of public land be among the most useful of our fellow citizen and since the system of sale for cash alone have be introduce great indulgence have be justly extend to those who have previously purchase upon credit the debt which have be contract under the credit sale have become unwieldy and its extinction be alike advantageous to the purchaser and to the public under the system of sale mature as it have be by experience and adapt to the exigency of the time the land will continue as they have become an abundant source of revenue and when the pledge of they to the public creditor shall have be redeem by the entire discharge of the national debt the swell tide of wealth with which they replenish the common treasury may be make to reflow in unfailing stream of improvement from the atlantic to the pacific ocean the condition of the various branch of the public service resort from the department of war and their administration during the current year will be exhibit in the report of the secretary of war and the accompany document herewith communicate the organization and discipline of the army be effective and satisfactory to counteract the prevalence of desertion among the troop it have be suggest to withhold from the man a small portion of their monthly pay until the period of their discharge and some expedient appear to be necessary to preserve and maintain among the officer so much of the art of horsemanship as could scarcely fail to be find want on the possible sudden eruption of a war which should take we unprovide with a single corps of cavalry the military academy at west point under the restriction of a severe but paternal superintendence recommend itself more and more to the patronage of the nation and the number of meritorious officer which it form and introduce to the public service furnish the mean of multiply the undertaking of the public improvement to which their acquirement at that institution be peculiarly adapt the school of artillery practice establish at fortress monroe hampton virginia be well suited to the same purpose and may need the aid of further legislative provision to the same end the report of the various officer at the head of the administrative branch of the military service connect with the quarter clothing subsistence health and pay of the army exhibit the assiduous vigilance of those officer in the performance of their respective duty and the faithful accountability which have pervade every part of the system our relation with the numerous tribe of aboriginal native of this country scatter over its extensive surface and so dependent even for their existence upon our power have be during the present year highly interesting an act of congress of 1824 05 25 make an appropriation to defray the expense of make treaty of trade and friendship with the indian tribe beyond the mississippi an act of 1825 03 03 authorize treaty to be make with the indians for their

sauks foxes etc for the purpose of establish boundary and promote peace between say tribe the first and last object of these act have be accomplish and the second be yet in a process of execution the treaty which since the last session of congress have be conclude with the several tribe will be lay before the senate for their consideration conformably to the constitution they comprise large and valuable acquisition of territory and they secure an adjustment of boundary and give pledge of permanent peace between several tribe which have be long wage bloody war against each other on the 12th of february last a treaty be sign at the indian springs between commissioner appoint on the part of the united states and certain chief and individual of the creek nation of indians which be receive at the seat of government only a very few day before the close of the last session of congress and of the late administration the advice and consent of the senate be give to it on the 3rd of march too late for it to receive the ratification of the then president of the united states it be ratify on the 7th of march under the unsuspecting impression that it have be negotiate in good faith and in the confidence inspire by the recommendation of the senate the subsequent transaction in relation to this treaty will form the subject of a separate communication the appropriation make by congress for public work as well in the construction of fortification as for purpose of internal improvement so far as they have be expend have be faithfuly apply their progress have be delay by the want of suitable officer for superintend they an increase of both the corps of engineer military and topographical be recommend by my predecessor at the last session of congress the reason upon which that recommendation be found subsist in all their force and have acquire additional urgency since that time the military academy at west point will furnish from the cadet there officer well qualified for carry this measure into effect the board of engineers for internal improvement appoint for carry into execution the act of congress of 1824 04 30 to procure the necessary survey plan and estimate on the subject of road and canal have be actively engage in that service from the close of the last session of congress they have complete the survey necessary for ascertain the practicability of a canal from the chesapeake bay to the ohio river and be prepare a full report on that subject which when complete will be lay before you the same observation be to be make with regard to the two other object of national importance upon which the board have be occupy namely the accomplishment of a national road from this city to new orleans and the practicability of unite the water of lake memphramagog with connecticut river and the improvement of the navigation of that river the survey have be make and be nearly complete the report may be expect at an early period during the present session of congress the act of congress of the last session relative to the surveying marking or lay out road in the territories of florida arkansas and michigan from missouri to mexico and for the continuation of the cumberland road be some of they fully execute and other in the process of execution those for complete or commencing fortification have be delay only so far as the corps of engineers have be inadequate to furnish officer for the necessary superintendence of the work under the act confirm the statute of virginia and maryland incorporate the chesapeake and ohio canal company three commissioner on the part of the united states have be appoint for opening book and receive subscription in concert with a like number of commissioner appoint on the part of each of those state a meeting of the commissioner have be post pone to await the definitive report of the board of engineer the light house and monument for the safety of our commerce and mariner the work for the security of plymouth beach and for the preservation of the island in boston harbor have receive the attention require by the law relate to those object respectively the continuation of the cumberland road the most important of they all after surmount no inconsiderable difficulty in fix upon the direction of the road have commence under the most promising of auspex with the improvement of recent invention in the mode of construction and with advantage of a great reduction in the comparative cost of the work the operation of the law relate to the revolutionary pensioner may deserve the renew consideration of congress the act of 1818 03 18 while it make provision for many meritorious and indigent citizen who have serve in the war of independence open a door to numerous abuse and imposition to remedy this the act of 1820 05 01 exact proof of absolute indigence which many really in want be unable and all susceptible of that delicacy which be ally to many virtue must be deeply reluctant to give the result have be that some among the least deserving have be retain and some in whom the requisite both of worth and want be combine have be stricken from the list as the number of these venerable relic of an age go by diminish as the decay of body mind and estate of those that survive must in the common course of nature increase should not a more liberal portion of indulgence be deal out to they may not the want in most instance be infer from the demand when the service can be prove and may not the last day of human infirmity be spare the mortification of purchase a pittance of relief only by the exposure of its own necessity i submit to congress the expediency of provide for individual case of this description by special enactment or of revise the act of 1820 05 01 with a view to mitigate the rigor of its exclusion in favor of person to whom charity now bestow can scarcely discharge the debt of justice the portion of the naval force of the union in actual service have be chiefly employ on three stations&mdash;the mediterranean the coast of south america border on the pacific ocean and the west indies an occasional cruiser have be send to range along the african shore most polluted by the traffic of slave one armed vessel have be station on the coast of our eastern boundary to cruise along the fishing ground in hudsons bay and on the coast of labrador and the first service of a new frigate have be perform in restore to his native soil and domestic enjoyment the veteran hero whose youthful blood and treasure have freely flow in the cause of our country 's independence and whose whole life have be a series of service and sacrifice to the improvement of his fellow man the visit of general lafayette alike honorable to himself and to our country close as it have commence with the most affect testimonial of devoted attachment on his part and of unbounded gratitude of this people to he in return it will form here after a pleasing incident in the annal of our union give to real history the intense interest of romance and signally mark the unpurchasable tribute of a great nation 's social affection to the disinterested champion of the liberty of humankind the constant maintenance of a small squadron in the mediterranean be a necessary substitute for the humiliating alternative of pay tribute for the security of our commerce in that sea and for a precarious peace at the mercy of every caprice of four barbary state by whom it be liable to be violate an additional motive for keep a respectable force station there at this time be find in the maritime war rage between the greeks and the turks and in which the neutral navigation of this union be always in danger of outrage and depredation a few instance have occur of such depredation upon our merchant vessel by privateer or pirate wear the grecian flag but without real authority from the greek or any other government the heroic struggle of the greeks themselves in which our warm sympathy as free man and christians have be engage have continue to be maintain with vicissitude of success adverse and favorable similar motive have render expedient the keeping of a like force on the coast of peru and chile on the pacific the irregular and convulsive character of the war upon the shore have be extend to the conflict upon the ocean an active warfare have be keep up for year with alternate success though generally to the advantage of the american patriot but their naval force have not always be under the control of their own government blockade unjustifiable upon any acknowledge principle of international law have be proclaim by officer in command and though disavow by the supreme authority the protection of our own commerce against they have be make cause of complaint and erroneous imputation against some of the most gallant officer of our navy complaint equally groundless have be make by the commander of the spanish royal force in those sea but the most effective protection to our commerce have be the flag and the firmness of our own commanding officer the cessation of the war by the complete triumph of the patriot cause have remove it be hope all cause of dissension with one party and all vestige of force of the other but an unsettled coast of many degree of latitude form a part of our own territory and a flourish commerce and fishery extend to the island of the pacific and to china still require that the protect power of the union should be display under its flag as well upon the ocean as upon the land the object of the west india squadron have be to carry into execution the law for the suppression of the african slave trade for the protection of our commerce against vessel of piratical character though bear commission from either of the belligerent party for its protection against open and unequivocal pirate these object during the present year have be accomplish more effectually than at any former period the african slave trade have long be exclude from the use of our flag and if some few citizen of our country have continue to set the law of the union as well as those of nature and humanity at defiance by persevere in that abominable traffic it have be only by shelter themselves under the banner of other nation less earnest for the total extinction of the trade of our the active persevere and unremitted energy of captain warrington and of the officer and man under his command on that try and perilous service have be crown with signal success and be entitle to the approbation of their country but experience have show that not even a temporary suspension or relaxation from assiduity can be indulge on that station without reproduce piracy and murder in all their horror nor be it probably that for year to come our immensely valuable commerce in those sea can navigate in security without the steady continuance of an armed force devote to its protection it be indeed a vain and dangerous illusion to believe that in the present or probable condition of human society a commerce so extensive and so rich as ours could exist and be pursue in safety without the continual support of a military marine&mdash;the only arm by which the power of this confederacy can be estimate or feel by foreign nation and the only stand military force which can never be dangerous to our own liberty at home a permanent naval peace establishment therefore adapt to our present condition and adaptable to that gigantic growth with which the nation be advance in its career be among the subject which have already occupy the foresight of the last congress and which will deserve your serious deliberation our navy commence at an early period of our present political organization upon a scale commensurate with the incipient energy the scanty resource and the comparative indigence of our infancy be even then find adequate to cope with all the power of barbary save the first and with one of the principle maritime power of europe at a period of further advancement but with little accession of strength it not only sustain with honor the most unequal of conflict but cover itself and our country with unfading glory but it be only since the close of the late war that by the number and force of the ship of which it be compose it could deserve the name of a navy yet it retain nearly the same organization as when it consist only of five frigate the rule and regulation by which it be govern earnestly call for revision and the want of a naval school of instruction correspond with the military academy at west point for the formation of scientific and accomplished officer be feel with daily increase aggravation the act of congress of 1824 05 26 authorize an examination and survey of the harbor of charleston in south carolina of st. marys in georgia and of the coast of florida and for other purpose have be execute so far as the appropriation would admit those of the 3rd of march last authorize the establishment of a navy yard and depot on the coast of florida in the gulf of mexico and authorize the building of 10 sloop of war and for other purpose be in the course of execution for the particular of which and other object connect with this department i refer to the report of the secretary of the navy herewith communicate a report from the postmaster general be also submit exhibit the present flourishing condition of that department for the first time for many year the receipt for the year end on the first of july last exceed the expenditure during the same period to the amount of more than $ 45,000 other fact equally creditable to the administration of this department be that in two year from 1823 07 01 an improvement of more than $ 185,000 in its pecuniary affair have be realize that in the same interval the increase of the transportation of the mail have exceed 1,500,000 mile annually and that 1,040 new post office have be establish it hence appear that under judicious management the income from this establishment may be rely on as fully adequate to defray its expense and that by the discontinuance of post road altogether unproductive other of more useful character may be open til the circulation of the mail shall keep pace with the spread of our population and the comfort of friendly correspondence the exchange of internal traffic and the light of the periodical press shall be distribute to the remotest corner of the union at a charge scarcely perceptible to any individual and without the cost of a dollar to the public treasury upon this first occasion of address the legislature of the union with which i have be honor in present to their view the execution so far as it have be effect of the measure sanction by they for promote the internal improvement of our country i can not close the communication without recommend to their calm and persevere consideration the general principle in a more enlarged extent the great object of the institution of civil government be the improvement of the condition of those who be party to the social compact and no government in what ever form constitute can accomplish the lawful end of its institution but in proportion as it improve the condition of those over whom it be establish road and canal by multiply and facilitate the communication and intercourse between distant region and multitude of man be among the most important mean of improvement but moral political intellectual improvement be duty assign by the author of our existence to social no less than to individual man for the fulfillment of those duty government be invest with power and to the attainment of the end&mdash;the progressive improvement of the condition of the governed&mdash;the exercise of delegate power be a duty as sacred and indispensable as the usurpation of power not grant be criminal and odious among the first perhaps the very first instrument for the improvement of the condition of man be knowledge and to the acquisition of much of the knowledge adapt to the want the comfort and enjoyment of human life public institution and seminary of learn be essential so convinced of this be the first of my predecessor in this office now first in the memory as live he be first in the heart of our countryman that once and again in his address to the congresses with whom he cooperate in the public service he earnestly recommend the establishment of seminary of learn to prepare for all the emergency of peace and war&mdash;a national university and a military academy with respect to the latter have he live to the present day in turn his eye to the institution at west point he would have enjoy the gratification of his most earnest wish but in survey the city which have be honor with his name he would have see the spot of earth which he have destine and bequeath to the use and benefit of his country as the site for a university still bare and barren in assume her station among the civilized nation of the earth it would seem that our country have contract the engagement to contribute her share of mind of labor and of expense to the improvement of those part of knowledge which lie beyond the reach of individual acquisition and particularly to geographical and astronomical science look back to the history only of the half century since the declaration of our independence and observe the generous emulation with which the government of france great britain and russia have devote the genius the intelligence the treasure of their respective nation to the common improvement of the specie in these branch of science be it not incumbent upon we to inquire whether we be not bind by obligation of a high and honorable character to contribute our portion of energy and exertion to the common stock the voyage of discovery prosecute in the course of that time at the expense of those nation have not only redound to their glory but to the improvement of human knowledge we have be partaker of that improvement and owe for it a sacred debt not only of gratitude but of equal or proportional exertion in the same common cause of the cost of these undertaking if the mere expenditure of outfit equipment and completion of the expedition be to be consider the only charge it would be unworthy of a great and generous nation to take a second thought one hundred expedition of circumnavigation like those of cook and la prouse would not burden the exchequer of the nation fit they out so much as the way and mean of defray a single campaign in war but if we take into account the life of those benefactor of man kind of which their service in the cause of their specie be the purchase how shall the cost of those heroic enterprise be estimate and what compensation can be make to they or to their country for they be it not by bear they in affectionate remembrance be it not still more by imitate their example&mdash;by enable country man of our own to pursue the same career and to hazard their life in the same cause?in invite the attention of congress to the subject of internal improvement upon a view thus enlarge it be not my desire to recommend the equipment of an expedition for circumnavigate the globe for purpose of scientific research and inquiry we have object of useful investigation nearer home and to which our care may be more beneficially apply the interior of our own territory have yet be very imperfectly explore our coast along many degree of latitude upon the shore of the pacific ocean though much frequent by our spirited commercial navigator have be barely visit by our public ship the river of the west first fully discover and navigate by a countryman of our own still bear the name of the ship in which he ascend its water and claim the protection of our armed national flag at its mouth with the establishment of a military post there or at some other point of that coast recommend by my predecessor and already mature in the deliberation of the last congress i would suggest the expediency of connect the equipment of a public ship for the exploration of the whole north west coast of this continent the establishment of an uniform standard of weight and measure be one of the specific object contemplate in the formation of our constitution and to fix that standard be on of the power delegate by express term in that instrument to congress the government of great britain and france have scarcely cease to be occupy with inquiry and speculation on the same subject since the existence of our constitution and with they it have expand into profound laborious and expensive research into the figure of the earth and the comparative length of the pendulum vibrate second in various latitude from the equator to the pole these research have result in the composition and publication of several work highly interesting to the cause of science the experiment be yet in the process of performance some of they have recently be make on our own shore within the wall of one of our own college and partly by one of our own fellow citizen it would be honorable to our country if the sequel of the same experiment should be countenance by the patronage of our government as they have hitherto be by those of france and britain connect with the establishment of an university or separate from it might be undertake the erection of an astronomical observatory with provision for the support of an astronomer to be in constant attendance of observation upon the phenomena of the heaven and for the periodical publication of his observance it be with no feeling of pride as an american that the remark may be make that on the comparatively small territorial surface of europe there be exist upward of 130 of these lighthouse of the sky while throughout the whole american hemisphere there be not one if we reflect a moment upon the discovery which in the last four century have be make in the physical constitution of the universe by the mean of these building and of observer station in they shall we doubt of their usefulness to every nation and while scarcely a year pass over our head without bring some new astronomical discovery to light which we must fain receive at second hand from europe be we not cut ourselves off from the mean of return light for light while we have neither observatory nor observer upon our half of the globe and the earth revolve in perpetual darkness to our unsearching eyes?when on 1791 10 25 the first president of the united states announce to congress the result of the first enumeration of the inhabitant of this union he inform they that the return give the pleasing assurance that the population of the united states border on 4,000,000 person at the distance of 30 year from that time the last enumeration five year since complete present a population border on 10,000,000 perhaps of all the evidence of a prosperous and happy condition of human society the rapidity of the increase of population be the most unequivocal but the demonstration of our prosperity rest not alone upon this indication our commerce our wealth and the extent of our territory have increase in corresponding proportion and the number of independent community associate in our federal union have since that time nearly double the legislative representation of the state and people in the two houses of congress have grow with the growth of their constituent body the house which then consist of 65 member now number upward of 200 the senate which consist of 26 member have now 48 but the executive and still more the judiciary department be yet in a great measure confine to their primitive organization and be now not adequate to the urgent want of a still grow community the naval armament which at an early period force themselves upon the necessity of the union soon lead to the establishment of a department of the navy but the departments of foreign affairs and of the interior which early after the formation of the government have be unite in one continue so united to this time to the unquestionable detriment of the public service the multiplication of our relation with the nation and government of the old world have keep pace with that of our population and commerce while within the last 10 year a new family of nation in our own hemisphere have arise among the inhabitant of the earth with whom our intercourse commercial and political would of itself furnish occupation to an active and industrious department the constitution of the judiciary experimental and imperfect as it be even in the infancy of our exist government be yet more inadequate to the administration of national justice at our present maturity nine year have elapse since a predecessor in this office now not the last the citizen who perhaps of all other throughout the union contribute most to the formation and establishment of our constitution in his valedictory address to congress immediately precede his retirement from public life urgently recommend the revision of the judiciary and the establishment of an additional executive department the exigency of the public service and its unavoidable deficiency as now in exercise have add yearly cumulative weight to the consideration present by he as persuasive to the measure and in recommend it to your deliberation i be happy to have the influence of this high authority in aid of the undoubting conviction of my own experience the law relate to the administration of the patent office be deserve of much consideration and perhaps susceptible of some improvement the grant of power to regulate the action of congress upon this subject have specify both the end to be obtain and the mean by which it be to be effect to promote the progress of science and useful art by secure for limited time to author and inventor the exclusive right to their respective writing and discovery if an honest pride might be indulge in the reflection that on the record of that office be already find invention the usefulness of which have scarcely be transcend in the annal of human ingenuity would not its exultation be allay by the inquiry whether the law have effectively insure to the inventor the reward destine to they by the constitution&mdash;even a limited term of exclusive right to their discoveries?on 1799 12 24 it be resolve by congress that a marble monument should be erect by the united states in the capitol at the city of washington that the family of general washington should be request to permit his body to be deposit under it and that the monument be so design as to commemorate the great event of his military and political life in remind congress of this resolution and that the monument contemplate by it remain yet without execution i shall indulge only the remark that the work at the capitol be approach to completion that the consent of the family desire by the resolution be request and obtain that a monument have be recently erect in this city over the remain of another distinguished patriot of the revolution and that a spot have be reserve within the wall where you be deliberate for the benefit of this and future age in which the mortal remain may be deposit of he whose spirit hover over you and listen with delight to every act of the representative of his nation which can tend to exalt and adorn his and their country the constitution under which you be assemble be a charter of limited power after full and solemn deliberation upon all or any of the object which urge by an irresistible sense of my own duty i have recommend to your attention should you come to the conclusion that however desirable in themselves the enactment of law for effecting they would transcend the power commit to you by that venerable instrument which we be all bind to support let no consideration induce you to assume the exercise of power not grant to you by the people but if the power to exercise exclusive legislation in all case what so ever over the district of columbia if the power to lay and collect taxis duty impost and excise to pay the debt and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united states if the power to regulate commerce with foreign nation and among the several states and with the indian tribe to fix the standard of weight and measure to establish post office and post road to declare war to raise and support army to provide and maintain a navy to dispose of and make all needful rule and regulation respect the territory or other property belong to the united states and to make all law which shall be necessary and proper for carry these power into execution&mdash;if these power and other enumerate in the constitution may be effectually bring into action by law promote the improvement of agriculture commerce and manufacture the cultivation and encouragement of the mechanic and of the elegant art the advancement of literature and the progress of the science ornamental and profound to refrain from exercise they for the benefit of the people themselves would be to hide in the earth the talent commit to our charge&mdash;would be treachery to the most sacred of trust the spirit of improvement be abroad upon the earth it stimulate the heart and sharpen the faculty not of our fellow citizen alone but of the nation of europe and of their ruler while dwell with pleasing satisfaction upon the superior excellence of our political institution let we not be unmindful that liberty be power that the nation bless with the large portion of liberty must in proportion to its number be the most powerful nation upon earth and that the tenure of power by man be in the moral purpose of his creator upon condition that it shall be exercise to end of beneficence to improve the condition of himself and his fellow man while foreign nation less bless with that freedom which be power than ourselves be advance with gigantic stride in the career of public improvement be we to slumber in indolence or fold up our arm and proclaim to the world that we be palsy by the will of our constituent would it not be to cast away the bounty of providence and doom ourselves to perpetual inferiority in the course of the year now draw to its close we have behold under the auspex and at the expense of one state of this union a new university unfold its portal to the son of science and hold up the torch of human improvement to eye that seek the light we have see under the persevering and enlightened enterprise of another state the water of our western lake mingle with those of the ocean if undertaking like these have be accomplish in the compass of a few year by the authority of single member of our confederation can we the representative authority of the whole union fall behind our fellow servant in the exercise of the trust commit to we for the benefit of our common sovereign by the accomplishment of work important to the whole and to which neither the authority nor the resource of any one state can be adequate?finally fellow citizen i shall await with cheer hope and faithful cooperation the result of your deliberation assure that without encroach upon the power reserve to the authority of the respective state or to the people you will with a due sense of your obligation to your country and of the high responsibility weigh upon yourself give efficacy to the mean commit to you for the common good and may he who search the heart of the child of man prosper your exertion to secure the blessing of peace and promote the high welfare of your country
fellow citizen of the senate and of the house of representatives the assemblage of the representative of our union in both houses of the congress at this time occur under circumstance call for the renew homage of our grateful acknowledgment to the giver of all good with the exception incidental to the most felicitous condition of human existence we continue to be highly favor in all the element which contribute to individual comfort and to national prosperity in the survey of our extensive country we have generally to observe abode of health and region of plenty in our civil and political relation we have peace without and tranquillity within our border we be as a people increase with unabated rapidity in population wealth and national resource and whatever difference of opinion exist among we with regard to the mode and the mean by which we shall turn the beneficence of heaven to the improvement of our own condition there be yet a spirit animate we all which will not suffer the bounty of providence to be shower upon we in vain but will receive they with grateful heart and apply they with unwearied hand to the advancement of the general good of the subject recommend to congress at their last session some be then definitively act upon other leave unfinished but partly mature will recur to your attention without need a renewal of notice from i the purpose of this communication will be to present to your view the general aspect of our public affair at this moment and the measure which have be take to carry into effect the intention of the legislature as signify by the law then and heretofore enact in our intercourse with the other nation of the earth we have still the happiness of enjoy peace and a general good understanding qualified however in several important instance by collision of interest and by unsatisfied claim of justice to the settlement of which the constitutional interposition of the legislative authority may become ultimately indispensable by the decease of the emperor alexander of russia which occur contemporaneously with the commencement of the last session of congress the united states have be deprive of a long try steady and faithful friend bear to the inheritance of absolute power and train in the school of adversity from which no power on earth however absolute be exempt that monarch from his youth have be teach to feel the force and value of public opinion and to be sensible that the interest of his own government would well be promote by a frank and friendly intercourse with this republic as those of his people would be advance by a liberal intercourse with our country a candid and confidential interchange of sentiment between he and the government of the u.s. upon the affair of southern america take place at a period not long precede his demise and contribute to fix that course of policy which leave to the other government of europe no alternative but that of soon or later recognize the independence of our southern neighbor of which the example have by the united states already be set the ordinary diplomatic communication between his successor the emperor nicholas and the united states have suffer some interruption by the illness departure and subsequent decease of his minister reside here who enjoy as he merit the entire confidence of his new sovereign as he have eminently respond to that of his predecessor but we have have the most satisfactory assurance that the sentiment of the reign emperor toward the united states be altogether conformable to those which have so long and constantly animate his imperial brother and we have reason to hope that they will serve to cement that harmony and good understanding between the two nation which found in congenial interest can not but result in the advancement of the welfare and prosperity of both our relation of commerce and navigation with france be by the operation of the convention of 1822 06 24 with that nation in a state of gradual and progressive improvement convince by all our experience no less than by the principle of fair and liberal reciprocity which the united states have constantly tender to all the nation of the earth as the rule of commercial intercourse which they would universally prefer that fair and equal competition be most conducive to the interest of both party the united states in the negotiation of that convention earnestly contend for a mutual renunciation of discriminating duty and charge in the port of the two country unable to obtain the immediate recognition of this principle in its full extent after reduce the duty of discrimination so far as be find attainable it be agree that at the expiration of two year from 1822 10 01 when the convention be to go into effect unless a notice of six month on either side should be give to the other that the convention itself must terminate those duty should be reduce one fourth and that this reducation should be yearly repeat until all discrimination should cease while the convention itself should continue in force by the effect of this stipulation three fourth of the discriminating duty which have be levy by each party upon the vessel of the other in its port have already be remove and on the first of next october should the convention be still in force the remain one fourth will be discontinue french vessel laden with french produce will be receive in our port on the same term as our own and our in return will enjoy the same advantage in the port of france by these approximation to an equality of duty and of charge not only have the commerce between the two country prosper but friendly disposition have be on both side encourage and promote they will continue to be cherish and cultivate on the part of the united states it would have be gratify to have have it in my power to add that the claim upon the justice of the french government involve the property and the comfortable subsistence of many of our fellow citizen and which have be so long and so earnestly urge be in a more promising train of adjustment than at your last meeting but their condition remain unaltered with the government of the netherlands the mutual abandonment of discriminating duty have be regulate by legislative act on both side the act of congress of 1818 04 20 abolish all discriminating duty of impost and tonnage upon the vessel and produce of the netherlands in the port of the united states upon the assurance give by the government of the netherlands that all such duty operate against the shipping and commerce of the united states in that kingdom have be abolish these reciprocal regulation have continue in force several year when the discriminating principle be resume by the netherlands in a new and indirect form by a bounty of 10 percent in the shape of a return of duty to their national vessel and in which those of the united states be not permit to participate by the act of congress of 1824 01 07 all discriminate duty in the united states be again suspend so far as relate to the vessel and produce of the netherlands so long as the reciprocal exemption should be extend to the vessel and produce of the united states in the netherlands but the same act provide that in the event of a restoration of discriminating duty to operate against the shipping and commerce of the united states in any of the foreign country refer to therein the suspension of discriminating duty in favor of the navigation of such foreign country should cease and all the provision of the act impose discriminate foreign tonnage and impost duty in the united states should revive and be in full force with regard to that nation in the correspondence with the government of the netherlands upon this subject they have contend that the favor show to their own shipping by this bounty upon their tonnage be not to be consider a discriminating duty but it can not be deny that it produce all the same effect have the mutual abolition be stipulate by treaty such a bounty upon the national vessel could scarcely have be grant consistent with good faith yet as the act of congress of 1824 01 07 have not expressly authorize the executive authority to determine what shall be consider as a revival of discriminating duty by a foreign government to the disadvantage of the united states and as the retaliatory measure on our part however just and necessary may tend rather to that conflict of legislation which we deprecate than to that concert to which we invite all commercial nation as most conducive to their interest and our own i have think it more consistent with the spirit of our institution to refer to the subject again to the paramount authority of the legislature to decide what measure the emergency may require than abruptly by proclamation to carry into effect the minatory provision of the act of 1824.during the last session of congress treaty of amity navigation and commerce be negotiate and sign at this place with the government of denmark in europe and with the federation of central america in this hemisphere these treaty then receive the constitutional sanction of the senate by the advice and consent to their ratification they be accordingly ratify on the part of the u.s. and during the recess of congress have be also ratify by the other respective contracting party the ratification have be exchange and they have be publish by proclamation copy of which be herewith communicate to congress these treaty have establish between the contracting party the principle of equality and reciprocity in their broad and most liberal extent each party admit the vessel of the other into its port laden with cargo the produce or manufacture of any quarter of the globe upon the payment of the same duty of tonnage and impost that be chargeable upon their own they have far stipulate that the party shall hereafter grant no favor of navigation or commerce to any other nation which shall not upon the same term be grant to each other and that neither party will impose upon article of merchandise the produce or manufacture of the other any other or high duty than upon the like article be the produce or manufacture of any other country to these principle there be in the convention with denmark an exception with regard to the colony of that kingdom in the arctic sea but none with regard to her colony in the west indies in the course of the last summer the term to which our last commercial treaty with sweden be limited have expire a continuation of it be in the contemplation of the swedish government and be believe to be desirable on the part of the united states it have be propose by the king of sweden that pende the negotiation of renewal the expire treaty should be mutually consider as still in force a measure which will require the sanction of congress to be carry into effect on our part and which i therefore recommend to your consideration with prussia spain portugal and in general all the european power between whom and the united states relation of friendly intercourse have exist their condition have not materially varied since the last session of congress i regret not to be able to say the same of our commercial intercourse with the colonial possession of great britain in america negotiation of the high importance to our common interest have be for several year in discussion between the two government and on the part of the united states have be invariably pursue in the spirit of candor and conciliation interest of great magnitude and delicacy have be adjust by the convention of 1815 and 1818 while that of 1822 mediate by the late emperor alexander have promise a satisfactory compromise of claim which the government of the u.s. in justice to the right of a numerous class of their citizen be bind to sustain but with regard to the commercial intercourse between the united states and the british colony in america it have be hitherto find impracticable to bring the party to an understanding satisfactory to both the relative geographical position and the respective product of nature cultivate by human industry have constitute the element of a commercial intercourse between the united states and british america insular and continental important to the inhabitant of both country but it have be interdict by great britain upon a principle heretofore practice upon by the colonize nation of europe of hold the trade of their colony each in exclusive monopoly to herself after the termination of the late war this interdiction have be revive and the british government decline include this portion of our intercourse with her possession in the negotiation of the convention of 1815 the trade be then carry on exclusively in british vessel til the act of congress concern navigation of 1818 and the supplemental act of 1820 meet the interdict by a corresponding measure on the part of the united states these measure not of retaliation but of necessary self defense be soon succeed by an act of parliament open certain colonial port to the vessel of the united states come directly from they and to the importation from they of certain article of our produce burden with heavy duty and exclude some of the most valuable article of our export the united states open their port to british vessel from the colony upon term as exactly correspond with those of the act of parliament as in the relative position of the party could be make and a negotiation be commence by mutual consent with the hope on our part that a reciprocal spirit of accommodation and a common sentiment of the importance of the trade to the interest of the inhabitant of the two country between whom it must be carry on would ultimately bring the party to a compromise with which both might be satisfy with this view the government of the united states have determine to sacrifice something of that entire reciprocity which in all commercial arrangement with foreign power they be entitle to demand and to acquiesce in some inequality disadvantageous to ourselves rather than to forego the benefit of a final and permanent adjustment of this interest to the satisfaction of great britain herself the negotiation repeatedly suspend by accidental circumstance be however by mutual agreement and express assent consider as pende and to be speedily resume in the mean time another act of parliament so doubtful and ambiguous in its import as to have be misunderstood by the officer in the colony who be to carry it into execution open again certain colonial port upon new condition and term with a threat to close they against any nation which may not accept those term as prescribe by the british government this act pass 1825&ndash;07 not communicate to the government of the u.s. not understand by the british officer of the custom in the colony where it be to be enforce be never the less submit to the consideration of congress at their last session with the knowledge that a negotiation upon the subject have long be in progress and pledge give of its resumption at an early day it be deem expedient to await the result of that negotiation rather than to subscribe implicitly to term the import of which be not clear and which the british authority themselves in this hemisphere be not prepared to explain immediately after the close of the last session of congress one of our most distinguished citizen be dispatch as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to great britain furnish with instruction which we could not doubt would lead to a conclusion of this long controvert interest upon term acceptable to great britain upon his arrival and before he have deliver his letter of credence he be bet by an order of the british council exclude from and after the first of december now current the vessel of the united states from all the colonial british port except those immediately border on our territory in answer to his expostulation upon a measure thus unexpected he be inform that accord to the ancient maxim of policy of european nation have colony their trade be an exclusive possession of the mother country that all participation in it by other nation be a boon or favor not form a subject of negotiation but to be regulate by the legislative act of the power own the colony that the british government therefore decline negotiate concern it and that as the u.s. do not forthwith accept purely and simply the term offer by the act of parliament of 1825&ndash;07 great britain would not now admit the vessel of the united states even upon the term on which she have open they to the navigation of other nation we have be accustom to consider the trade which we have enjoy with the british colony rather as an interchange of mutual benefit than as a mere favor receive that under every circumstance we have give an ample equivalent we have see every other nation hold colony negotiate with other nation and grant they freely admission to the colony by treaty and so far be the other colonizing nation of europe now from refuse to negotiate for trade with their colony that we ourselves have secure access to the colony of more than one of they by treaty the refusal however of great britain to negotiate leave to the united states no other alternative than that of regulate or interdict altogether the trade on their part accord as either measure may effect the interest of our own country and with that exclusive object i would recommend the whole subject to your calm and candid deliberation it be hope that our unavaile exertion to accomplish a cordial good understanding on this interest will not have an unpropitious effect upon the other great topic of discussion between the two government our northeastern and northwestern boundary be still unadjusted the commissioner under the seventh article of the treaty of ghent have nearly come to the close of their labor nor can we renounce the expectation enfeeble as it be that they may agree upon their report to the satisfaction or acquiescence of both party the commission for liquidate the claim for indemnity for slave carry away after the close of the war have be sit with doubtful prospect of success proposition of compromise have however pass between the two government the result of which we flatter ourselves may yet prove unsatisfactory our own disposition and purpose toward great britain be all friendly and conciliatory nor can we abandon but with strong reluctance the belief that they will ultimately meet a return not of favor which we neither as nor desire but of equal reciprocity and good will with the american government of this hemisphere we continue to maintain an intercourse altogether friendly and between their nation and our that commercial interchange of which mutual benefit be the source of mutual comfort and harmony the result be in a continual state of improvement the war between spain and they since the total expulsion of the spanish military force from their continental territory have be little more than nominal and their internal tranquillity though occasionally menace by the agitation which civil war never fail to leave behind they have not be affect by any serious calamity the congress of minister from several of those nation which assemble at panama after a short session there adjourn to meet again at a more favorable season in the neighborhood of mexico the decease of one of our minister on his way to the isthmus and the impediment of the season which delay the departure of the other deprive united states of the advantage of be represent at the first meeting of the congress there be however no reason to believe that any transaction of the congress be of a nature to affect injuriously the interest of the united states or to require the interposition of our minister have they be present their absence have indeed deprive united states of the opportunity of possess precise and authentic information of the treaty which be conclude at panama and the whole result have confirm i in the conviction of the expediency to the united states of be represent at the congress the survive member of the mission appoint during your last session have accordingly proceed to his destination and a successor to his distinguished and lamented associate will be nominate to the senate a treaty of amity navigation and commerce have in the course of the last summer be conclude by our minister plenipotentiary at mexico with the united state of that confederacy which will also be lay before the senate for their advice with regard to its ratification in advert to the present condition of our fiscal concern and to the prospect of our revenue the first remark that call our attention be that they be less exuberantly prosperous than they be at the corresponding period of the last year the severe shock so extensively sustain by the commercial and manufacturing interest in great britain have not be without a perceptible recoil upon ourselves a reduce importation from abroad be necessarily succeed by a reduce return to the treasury at home the net revenue of the present year will not equal that of the last and the receipt of that which be to come will fall short of those in the current year the diminution however be in part attributable to the flourishing condition of some of our domestic manufacture and so far be compensate by an equivalent more profitable to the nation it be also highly gratifying to perceive that the deficiency in the revenue while it scarcely exceed the anticipation of the last year 's estimate from the treasury have not interrupt the application of more than $ 11 million during the present year to the discharge of the principal and interest of the debt nor the reduction of upward of $ 7,000,000 of the capital of the debt itself the balance in the treasury on the first of january last be $ 5,201,650.43 the receipt from that time to the 30th of september last be $ 19,585,932.50 the receipt of the current quarter estimate at $ 6,000,000 yield with the sum already receive a revenue of about $ 25,500,000 for the year the expenditure for the first three quarter of the year have amount to $ 18,714,226.66 the expenditure of the current quarter be expect include the $ 2,000,000 of the principal of the debt to be pay to balance the receipt so that the expense of the year amount to upward of $ 1,000,000 less than its income will leave a proportionally increase balance in the treasury on 1827 01 01 over that of the first of january last instead of $ 5,200,000 there will be $ 6,400,000.the amount of duty secure on merchandise import from the commence of the year til september 30 be estimate at $ 21,250,000 and the amount that will probably accrue during the present quarter be estimate at $ 4,250,000 make for the whole year $ 25,500,000 from which the draw back be deduct will leave a clear revenue from the custom receivable in the year 1827 of about $ 20,400,000 which with the sum to be receive from the proceed of public land the bank dividend and other incidental receipt will form an aggregate of about $ 23,000,000 a sum fall short of the whole expense of the present year little more than the portion of those expenditure apply to the discharge of the public debt beyond the annual appropriation of $ 10,000,000 by the act of 1817 03 03 at the passage of that act the public debt amount to $ 123,500,000 on the first of january next it will be short of $ 74,000,000 in the lapse of these 10 year $ 50,000,000 of public debt with the annual charge of upward of $ 3,000,000 of interest upon they have be extinguish at the passage of tat act of the annual appropriation of $ 10,000,000 $ 7,000,000 be absorb in the payment of interest and not more than $ 3,000,000 go to reduce the capital of the debt of the same $ 10,000,000 at this time scarcely $ 4,000,000 be applicable to the interest and upward of $ 6,000,000 be effective in melt down the capital yet our experience have prove that a revenue consist so largely of impost and tonnage ebb and flow to an extraordinary extent with all the fluctuation incident to the general commerce of the world it be within our recollection that even in the compass of the same last 10 year the receipt of the treasury be not adequate to the expenditure of the year and that in two successive year it be find necessary to resort to loan to meet the engagement of the nation the return tide of the succeed year replenish the public coffer until they have again begin to feel the vicissitude of a decline to produce these alternation of fullness and exhaustion the relative operation of abundant or unfruitful season the regulation of foreign government political revolution the prosperous or decay condition of manufacture commercial speculation and many other cause not always to be trace variously combine we have find the alternate swell and diminution embrace period of from two to three year the last period of depression to united states be from 1819 to 1822 the corresponding revival be from 1823 to the commencement of the present year still we have no cause to apprehend a depression comparable to that of the former period or even to anticipate a deficiency which will intrench upon the ability to apply the annual $ 10 million to the reduction of the debt it be well for we however to be admonish of the necessity of abide by the maxim of the most vigilant economy and of resort to all honorable and useful expedient for pursue with steady and inflexible perseverance the total discharge of the debt besides the $ 7,000,000 of the loan of 1813 which will have be discharge in the course of the present year there be $ 9,000,000 which by the term of the contract would have be and be now redeemable $ 13,000,000 more of the loan of 1814 will become redeemable from and after the expiration of the present month and $ 9,000,000 other from and after the close of the ensue year they constitute a mass of $ 31,000,000 all bear an interest of 6 percent more than $ 20,000,000 of which will be immediately redeemable and the rest within little more than a year leave of this amount $ 15,000,000 to continue at the interest of 6 percent but to be pay off as far as shall be find practicable in the year 1827 and 1828 there be scarcely a doubt that the remain $ 16,000,000 might within a few month be discharge by a loan at not exceed 5 percent redeemable in the year 1829 and 1830 by this operation a sum of nearly $ 500,000 may be save to the nation and the discharge of the whole $ 31,000,000 within the four year may be greatly facilitate if not wholly accomplish by an act of congress of 1835 03 03 a loan for the purpose now refer to or a subscription to stock be authorize at an interest not exceed 4.5 percent but at that time so large a portion of the float capital of the country be absorb in commercial speculation and so little be leave for investment in the stock that the measure be but partially successful at the last session of congress the condition of the fund be still unpropitious to the measure but the change so soon afterwards occur that have the authority exist to redeem the $ 9 million now redeemable by an exchange of stock or a loan at 5 percent it be morally certain that it might have be effect and with it a yearly saving of $ 90,000.with regard to the collection of the revenue of impost certain occurrence have within the last year be disclose in one or two of our principal port which engage the attention of congress at their last session and may hereafter require further consideration until within a very few year the execution of the law for raise the revenue like that of all our other law have be insure more by the moral sense of the community than by the rigor of a jealous precaution or by penal sanction confide in the exemplary punctuality and unsullied integrity of our import merchant a gradual relaxation from the provision of the collection law a close adherence to which have cause inconvenience and expense to they have long become habitual and indulgence have be extend universally because they have never be abuse it may be worthy of your serious consideration whether some further legislative provision may not be necessary to come in aid of this state of unguarded security from the report herewith communicate of the secretaries of war and of the navy with the subsidiary document annex to they will be discover the present condition and administration of our military establishment on the land and on the sea the organization of the army having undergo no change since its reduction to the present peace establishment in 1821 it remain only to observe that it be yet find adequate to all the purpose for which a permanent armed force in time of peace can be need or useful it may be proper to add that from a difference of opinion between the late president of the united states and the senate with regard to the construction of the act of congress of 1821 03 02 to reduce and fix the military peace establishment of the u.s. it remain hitherto so far without execution that no colonel have be appoint to command one of the regiment of artillery a supplementary or explanatory act of the legislature appear to be the only expedient practicable for remove the difficulty of this appointment in a period of profound peace the conduct of the mere military establishment form but a very inconsiderable portion of the duty devolve upon the administration of the department of war it will be see by the return from the subordinate department of the army that every branch of the service be mark with order regularity and discipline that from the command general through all the gradation of superintendence the officer feel themselves to have be citizen before they be soldier and that the glory of a republican army must consist in the spirit of freedom by which it be animate and of patriotism by which it be impel it may be confidently state that the moral character of the army be in a state of continual improvement and that all the arrangement for the disposal of its part have a constant reference to that end but to the war department be attribute other duty have indeed relation to a future possible condition of war but be purely defensive and in their tendency contribute rather to the security and permanency of peace&mdash;the erection of the fortification provide for by congress and adapt to secure our shore from hostile invasion the distribution of the fund of public gratitude and justice to the pensioner of the revolutionary war the maintenance of our relation of peace and protection with the indian tribe and the internal improvement and survey for the location of road and canal which during the last three session of congress have engage so much of their attention and may engross so large a share of their future benefaction to our country by the act of 1824 04 30 suggest and approve by my predecessor the sum of $ 30,000 be appropriate for the purpose of cause to be make the necessary survey plan and estimate of the route of such road and canal as the president of the united states might deem of national importance in a commercial or military point of view or necessary for the transportation of the public mail the survey plan and estimate for each when complete will be lay before congress in execution of this act a board of engineer be immediately institute and have be since most assiduously and constantly occupy in carry it into effect the first object to which their labor be direct by order of the late president be the examination of the country between the tide water of the potomac the ohio and lake erie to ascertain the practicability of a communication between they to designate the most suitable route for the same and to form plan and estimate in detail of the expense of execution on 1825 02 03 they make their first report which be immediately communicate to congress and in which they declare that having maturely consider the circumstance observe by they personally and carefully study the result of such of the preliminary survey as be then complete they be decidedly of opinion that the communication be practicable at the last session of congress before the board of engineer be enable to make up their second report contain a general plan and preparatory estimate for the work the committee of the house of representatives upon roads and canals close the session with a report express the hope that the plan and estimate of the board of engineer might at this time be prepare and that the subject be refer to the early and favorable consideration of congress at their present session that expect report of the board of engineer be prepare and will forthwith be lay before you under the resolution of congress authorize the secretary of war to have prepare a complete system of cavalry tactic and a system of exercise and instruction of field artillery for the use of the militia of the u.s. to be report to congress at the present session a board of distinguished officer of the army and of the militia have be convene whose report will be submit to you with that of the secretary of war the occasion be think favorable for consult the same board aid by the result of a correspondence with the governor of the several state and territory and other citizen of intelligence and experience upon the acknowledge defective condition of our militia system and of the improvement of which it be susceptible the report of the board upon this subject be also submit for your consideration in the estimate of appropriation for the ensue year upward of $ 5 million will be submit for the expenditure to be pay from the department of war less than two fifth of this will be applicable to the maintenance and support of the army $ 1,500,000 in the form of pension go as a scarcely adequate tribute to the service and sacrifice of a former age and a more than equal sum invest in fortification or for the preparation of internal improvement provide for the quiet the comfort and happy existence of the age to come the appropriation to indemnify those unfortunate remnant of another race unable alike to share in the enjoyment and to exist in the presence of civilization though swell in recent year to a magnitude burdensome to the treasury be generally not without their equivalent in profitable value or serve to discharge the union from engagement more burdensome than debt in like manner the estimate of appropriation for the navy department will present an aggregate sum of upward of $ 3 million about half of these however cover the current expenditure of the navy in actual service and half constitute a fund of national property the pledge of our future glory and defense it be scarcely one short year after the close of the late war and when the burden of its expense and charge be weigh heavy upon the country that congress by the act of 1816 04 29 appropriate $ 1 million annually for eight year to the gradual increase of the navy at a subsequent period this annual appropriation be reduce to $ 0,500,000 for six year of which the present year be the last a yet more recent appropriation the last two year for build 10 sloop of war have nearly restore the original appropriation of 1816 of $ 1 million for every year the result be before united states all we have 12 line of battle ship 20 frigate and sloop of war in proportion which with a few month preparation may present a line of float fortification along the whole range of our coast ready to meet any invader who might attempt to set foot upon our shore combine with a system of fortification upon the shore themselves commence about the same time under the auspex of my immediate predecessor and hitherto systematically pursue it have place in our possession the most effective sinew of war and have leave we at once an example and a lesson from which our own duty may be infer the gradual increase of the navy be the principle of which the act of 1816 04 29 be the first development it be the introduction of a system to act upon the character and history of our country for an indefinite series of age it be a declaration of that congress to their constituent and to posterity that it be the destiny and the duty of these confederate state to become in regular process of time and by no petty advance a great naval power that which they propose to accomplish in eight year be rather to be consider as the measure of their mean that the limitation of their design they look forward for a term of year sufficient for the accomplishment of a definite portion of their purpose and they leave to their successor to fill up the canvas of which they have trace the large and prophetic outline the ship of the line and frigate which they have in contemplation will be shortly complete the time which they have allot for the accomplishment of the work have more than elapse it remain for your consideration how their successor may contribute their portion of toil and of treasure for the benefit of the succeed age in the gradual increase of our navy there be perhaps no part of the exercise of the constitutional power of the federal government which have give more general satisfaction to the people of the union than this the system have not be thus vigorously introduce and hitherto sustain to be now depart from or abandon in continue to provide for the gradual increase of the navy it may not be necessary or expedient to add for the present any more to the number of our ship but should you deem it advisable to continue the yearly appropriation of $ 0.5 million to the same object it may be profitably expend in a provide a supply of timber to be season and other material for future use in the construction of dock or in lay the foundation of a school for naval education as to the wisdom of congress either of those measure may appear to claim the preference of the small portion of this navy engage in actual service during the peace squadron have continue to be maintain in the pacific ocean in the west india sea and in the mediterranean to which have be add a small armament to cruise on the eastern coast of south america in all they have afford protection to our commerce have contribute to make our country advantageously know to foreign nation have honorably employ multitude of our sea man in the service of their country and have inure number of youth of the rise generation to life of manly hardihood and of nautical experience and skill the piracy with which the west india sea be for several year infest have be totally suppress but in the mediterranean they have increase in a manner afflictive to other nation and but for the continued presence of our squadron would probably have be distress to our own the war which have unfortunately break out between the republic of buenos aires and the brazilian government have give rise to very great irregularity among the naval officer of the latter by whom principle in relation to blockade and to neutral navigation have be bring forward to which we can not subscribe and which our own commander have find it necessary to resist from the friendly disposition toward the united states constantly manifest by the emperor of brazil and the very useful and friendly commercial intercourse between the united states and his dominion we have reason to believe that the just reparation demand for the injury sustain by several of our citizen from some of his officer will not be withhold abstract from the recent dispatch of the commander of our several squadron be communicate with the report of the secretary of the navy to congress a report from the postmaster general be likewise communicate present in a highly satisfactory manner the result of a vigorous efficient and economical administration of that department the revenue of the office even of the year include the latter half of 1824 and the first half of 1825 have exceed its expenditure by a sum of more than $ 45,000 that of the succeed year have be still more productive the increase of the receipt in the year precede the first of july last over that of the year before exceed $ 136,000 and the excess of the receipt over the expenditure of the year have swell from $ 45,000 to yearly $ 80,000.dure the same period contract for additional transportation of the mail in stage for about 260,000 mile have be make and for 70,000 mile annually on horse back 714 new post office have be establish within the year and the increase of revenue within the last three year as well as the augmentation of the transportation by mail be more than equal to the whole amount of receipt and of mail conveyance at the commencement of the present century when the seat of the general government be remove to this place when we reflect that the object effect by the transportation of the mail be among the choice comfort and enjoyment of social life it be pleasing to observe that the dissemination of they to every corner of our country have outstrip in their increase even the rapid march of our population by the treaty with france and spain respectively cede louisiana and the floridas to the united states provision be make for the security of land title derive from the government of those nation some progress have be make under the authority of various act of congress in the ascertainment and establishment of those title but claim to a very large extent remain unadjusted the public faith no less than the just right of individual and the interest of the community itself appear to require further provision for the speedy settlement of those claim which i therefore recommend to the care and attention of the legislature in conformity with the provision of the act of 1825 05 20 to provide for erect a penitentiary in the district of columbia and for other purpose three commissioner be appoint to select a site for the erection of a penitentiary for the district and also a site in the county of alexandria for a county jail both of which object have be effect the building of the penitentiary have be commence and be in such a degree of forwardness as to promise that it will be complete before the meeting of the next congress this consideration point to the expediency of mature at the present session a system for the regulation and government of the penitentiary and of define a system for the regulation and government of the penitentiary and of define the class of offense which shall be punishable by confinement in this edifice in close this communication i trust that it will not be deem inappropriate to the occasion and purpose upon which we be here assemble to indulge a momentary retrospect combine in a single glance the period of our origin as a national confederation with that of our present existence at the precise interval of half a century from each other since your last meeting at this place the 50th anniversary of the day when our independence be declare have be celebrate throughout our land and on that day while every heart be bound with joy and every voice be tune to gratulation amid the blessing of freedom and independence which the sire of a former age have hand down to their child two of the principal actor in that solemn scene&mdash;the hand that pen the ever memorable declaration and the voice that sustain it in debate&mdash;were by one summon at the distance of 700 mile from each other call before the judge of all to account for their deed do upon earth they depart cheer by the benediction of their country to whom they leave the inheritance of their fame and the memory of their bright example if we turn our thought to the condition of their country in the contrast of the first and last day of that half century how resplendent and sublime be the transition from gloom to glory then glance through the same lapse of time in the condition of the individual we see the first day mark with the fullness and vigor of youth in the pledge of their life their fortune and their sacred honor to the cause of freedom and of mankind and on the last extend on the bed of death with but sense and sensibility leave to breathe a last aspiration to heaven of blessing upon their country may we not humbly hope that to they too it be a pledge of transition from gloom to glory and that while their mortal vestment be sink into the clod of the valley their emancipate spirit be ascend to the bosom of their god
to the senate and house of representatives of the united states

 i submit to the consideration of congress a letter from the agent of the united states with the creek indians who invoke the protection of the government of the united states in defense of the right and territory secure to that nation by the treaty conclude at washington and ratify on the part of the united states on the 22d of april last

 the complaint set forth in this letter that surveyor from georgia have be employ in survey land within the indian territory as secure by that treaty be authenticate by the information inofficially receive from other quarter and there be reason to believe that one or more of the surveyor have be arrest in their progress by the indians their forbearance and reliance upon the good faith of the united states will it be hope avert scene of violence and blood which there be otherwise too much cause to apprehend will result from these proceeding

 by the fifth section of the act of congress of the 30th of march 1802 to regulate trade and intercourse with the indian tribe and to preserve peace on the frontier it be provide that if any citizen of or other person resident in the united states shall make a settlement on any land belong or secure or grant by treaty with the united states to any indian tribe or shall survey or attempt to survey such land or designate any of the boundary by mark tree or otherwise such offender shall forfeit a sum not exceed $ 1,000 and suffer imprisonment not exceed twelve month

 by the sixteenth and seventeenth section of the same statute two distinct process be prescribe by either or both of which the above enactment may be carry into execution by the first it be declare to be lawful for the military force of the united states to apprehend every person find in the indian country over and beyond the boundary line between the united states and the indian tribe in violation of any of the provision or regulation of the act and immediately to convey they in the near convenient and safe route to the civil authority of the united states in some of the three next adjoining state or district to be proceed against in due course of law

 by the second it be direct that if any person charge with the violation of any of the provision or regulation of the act shall be find within any of the united states or either of their territorial district such offender may be there apprehend and bring to trial in the same manner as if such crime or offense have be commit within such state or district and that it shall be the duty of the military force of the united states when call upon by the civil magistrate or any proper officer or other person duly authorize for that purpose and have a lawful warrant to aid and assist such magistrate officer or other person so authorize in arrest such offender and commit he to safe custody for trial accord to law

 the first of these process be adapt to the arrest of the trespasser upon indian territory on the spot and in the act of commit the offense but as it apply the action of the government of the united states to place where the civil process of the law have no authorized course it be commit entirely to the function of the military force to arrest the person of the offender and after bring he within the reach of the jurisdiction of the court there to deliver he into custody for trial the second make the violator of the law amenable only after his offense have be consummate and when he have return within the civil jurisdiction of the union this process in the first instance be merely of a civil character but may in like manner be enforce by call in if necessary the aid of the military force

 entertain no doubt that in the present case the resort to either of these mode of process or to both be within the discretion of the executive authority and penetrate with the duty of maintain the right of the indians as secure both by the treaty and the law i conclude after full deliberation to have recourse on this occasion in the first instance only to the civil process instruction have accordingly be give by the secretary of war to the attorney and marshal of the united states in the district of georgia to commence prosecution against the surveyor complain of as having violate the law while order have at the same time be forward to the agent of the united states at once to assure the indians that their right found upon the treaty and the law be recognize by this government and will be faithfully protect and earnestly to exhort they by the forbearance of every act of hostility on their part to preserve unimpaired that right to protection secure to they by the sacred pledge of the good faith of this nation copy of these instruction and order be herewith transmit to congress

 in abstain at this stage of the proceeding from the application of any military force i have be govern by consideration which will i trust meet the concurrence of the legislature among they one of paramount importance have be that these survey have be attempt and partly effect under color of legal authority from the state of georgia that the surveyor be therefore not to be view in the light of individual and solitary transgressor but as the agent of a sovereign state act in obedience to authority which they believe to be bind upon they intimation have be give that should they meet with interruption they would at all hazard be sustain by the military force of the state in which event if the military force of the union should have be employ to enforce its violate law a conflict must have ensue which would itself have inflict a wound upon the union and have present the aspect of one of these confederate states at war with the rest anxious above all to avert this state of thing yet at the same time impress with the deep conviction of my own duty to take care that the law shall be execute and the faith of the nation preserve i have use of the mean intrust to the executive for that purpose only those which without resort to military force may vindicate the sanctity of the law by the ordinary agency of the judicial tribunal

 it ought not however to be disguise that the act of the legislature of georgia under the construction give to it by the governor of that state and the survey make or attempt by his authority beyond the boundary secure by the treaty of washington of april last to the creek indians be in direct violation of the supreme law of this land set forth in a treaty which have receive all the sanction provide by the constitution which we have be swear to support and maintain

 happily distribute as the sovereign power of the people of this union have be between their general and state governments their history have already too often present collision between these divide authority with regard to the extent of their respective power no instance however have hitherto occur in which this collision have be urge into a conflict of actual force no other case be know to have happen in which the application of military force by the government of the union have be prescribe for the enforcement of a law the violation of which have within any single state be prescribe by a legislative act of the state in the present instance it be my duty to say that if the legislative and executive authority of the state of georgia should persevere in act of encroachment upon the territory secure by a solemn treaty to the indians and the law of the union remain unaltered a superadded obligation even high than that of human authority will compel the executive of the united states to enforce the law and fulfill the duty of the nation by all the force commit for that purpose to his charge that the arm of military force will be resort to only in the event of the failure of all other expedient provide by the law a pledge have be give by the forbearance to employ it at this time it be submit to the wisdom of congress to determine whether any further act of legislation may be necessary or expedient to meet the emergency which these transaction may produce

in their most effective channel the stream which contribute to the public weal be the purpose for which government be institute object of deep importance to the welfare of the union be constantly recur to demand the attention of the federal legislature and they call with accumulate interest at the first meeting of the two houses after their periodical renovation to present to their consideration from time to time subject in which the interest of the nation be most deeply involve and for the regulation of which the legislative will be alone competent be a duty prescribe by the constitution to the performance of which the first meeting of the new congress be a period eminently appropriate and which it be now my purpose to discharge our relation of friendship with the other nation of the earth political and commercial have be preserve unimpaired and the opportunity to improve they have be cultivate with anxious and unremitting attention a negotiation upon subject of high and delicate interest with the government of great britain have terminate in the adjustment of some of the question at issue upon satisfactory term and the postponement of other for future discussion

congress of 1827 03 02 for the distribution of the indemnity of the person entitle to receive it be now in session and approach the consummation of their labor this final disposal of one of the most painful topic of collision between the united states and great britain not only afford an occasion of gratulation to ourselves but have have the happy effect in promote a friendly disposition and in soften asperity upon other object of discussion nor ought it to pass without the tribute of a frank and cordial acknowledgment of the magnanimity with which an honorable nation by the reparation of their own wrong achieve a triumph more glorious than any field of blood can ever bestow the convention of 1815 07 03 and of 1818 10 20 will expire by their own limitation on 1828 10 20 these have regulate the direct commercial intercourse between the united states and great britain upon term of the most perfect reciprocity and they effect a temporary compromise of the respective right and claim to territory westward of the rocky mountains these arrangement have be continue for an indefinite period of time after the expiration of the above mention convention leave each party the liberty of terminate they by give twelve month notice to the other the radical principle of all commercial intercourse between independent nation be the mutual interest of both party it be the vital spirit of trade itself nor can it be reconcile to the nature of man or to the primary law of human society that any traffic should long be willingly pursue of which all the advantage be on one side and all the burden on the other treaty of commerce have be find by experience to be among the most effective instrument for promote peace and harmony between nation whose interest exclusively consider on either side be bring into frequent collision by competition in frame such treaty it be the duty of each party not simply to urge with unyielde pertinacity that which suit its own interest but to concede liberally to that which be adapt to the interest of the other to accomplish this little more be generally require than a simple observance of the rule of reciprocity and be it possible for the states- man of 1 nation by stratagem and management to obtain from the weakness or ignorance of another an over reach treaty such a compact would prove an incentive to war rather than a bond of peace our convention with great britain be found upon the principle of reciprocity the commercial intercourse between the two country be great in magnitude and amount than between any two other nation on the globe it be for all purpose of benefit or advantage to both as precious and in all probability far more extensive than if the party be still constituent part of one and the same nation treaty between such state regulate the intercourse of peace between they and adjust interest of such transcendent importance to both which have be find in a long experience of year mutually advantageous should not be lightly cancel or discontinue two convention for continue in force those above mention have be conclude between the plenipotentiary of the two government on 1827 08 06 and will be forthwith lay before the senate for the exercise of their constitutional authority concern they in the execution of the treaty of peace of 1782 11 and 1783 09 between the united states and great britain and which terminate the war of our independence a line of boundary be draw as the demarcation of territory between the two country extend over nearly 20 degree of latitude and range over sea lake and mountain then very imperfectly explore and scarcely open to the geographical knowledge of the age in the progress of discovery and settlement by both party since that time several question of boundary between their respective territory have arise which have be find of exceedingly difficult adjustment at the close of the last war with great britain four of these question press themselves upon the consideration of the negotiator of the treaty of ghent but without the mean of conclude a definitive arrangement concern they they be refer to three separate commission consist of two commissioner one appoint by each party to examine and decide upon their respective claim in the event of a disagreement between the commissioner one appoint by each party to examine and decide upon their respective claim in the event of a disagreement between the commissioner it be provide that they should make report to their several government and that the report should finally be refer to the decision of a sovereign the common friend of both of these commission two have already terminate their session and investigation one by entire and the other by partial agreement the commissioner of the 5th article of the treaty of ghent have finally disagree and make their conflicting report to their own government but from these report a great difficulty have occur in make up a question to be decide by the arbitrator this purpose have however be effect by a 4th convention conclude at london by the plenipotentiary of the two government on 1827 09 29 it will be submit together with the other to the consideration of the senate while these question have be pending incident have occur of conflict pretension and of dangerous character upon the territory itself in dispute between the two nation by a common understanding between the government it be agree that no exercise of exclusive jurisdiction by either party while the negotiation be pende should change the state of the question of right to be definitively settle such collision have never the less recently take place by occurrence the precise character of which have not yet be ascertain a communication from the governor of the state of maine with accompany document and a correspondence between the secretary of state and the minister of great britain on this subject be now communicate measure have be take to ascertain the state of the fact more correctly by the employment of a special agent to visit the spot where the allege outrage have occur the result of those inquiry when receive will be transmit to congress while so many of the subject of high interest to the friendly relation between the two country have be so far adjust it be a matter of regret that their view respect the commercial intercourse between the united states and the british colonial possession have not equally approximate to a friendly agreement at the commencement of the last session of congress they be inform of the sudden and unexpected exclusion by the british government of access in vessel of the united states to all their colonial port except those immediately border upon our own territory in the amicable discussion which have succeed the adoption of this measure which as it affect harshly the interest of the united states become subject of expostulation on our part the principle upon which its justification have be place have be of a diversified character it have be at once ascribe to a mere recurrence to the old long establish principle of colonial monopoly and at the same time to a feeling of resentment because the offer of an act of parliament open the colonial port upon certain condition have not be grasp at with sufficient eagerness by an instantaneous conformity to they at a subsequent period it have be intimate that the new exclusion be in resentment because a prior act of parliament of 1822 open certain colonial port under heavy and burdensome restriction to vessel of the united states have not be reciprocate by an admission of british vessel from the colony and their cargo without any restriction or discrimination what ever but be the motive for the interdiction what it may the british government have manifest no disposition either by negotiation or by correspond legislative enactment to recede from it and we have be give distinctly to understand that neither of the bill which be under the consideration of congress at their last session would have be deem sufficient in their concession to have be reward by any relaxation from the british interdict it be one of the inconvenience inseparably connect with the attempt to adjust by reciprocal legislation interest of this nature that neither party can know what would be satisfactory to the other and that after enact a statute for the avowed and sincere purpose of conciliation it will generally be find utterly inadequate to the expectation of the other party and will terminate in mutual disappointment the session of congress having terminate without any act upon the subject a proclamation be issue on 1827 03 17 conformably to the provision of the 6th section of the act of 1823 03 01 declare the fact that the trade and intercourse authorize by the british act of parliament of 1822 06 24 between the united states and the british enumerate colonial port have be by the subsequent act of parliament of 1825 07 05 and the order of council of 1826 07 27 prohibit the effect of this proclamation by the term of the act under which it be issue have be that each and every provision of the act concern navigation of 1818 04 18 and of the act supplementary thereto of 1820 05 15 revive and be in full force such then be the present condition of the trade that useful as it be to both party it can with a single momentary exception be carry on directly by the vessel of neither that exception itself be find in a proclamation of the governor of the island of st. christopher and of the virgin islands invite for 3 month from 1827 08 28 the importation of the article of the produce of the united states which constitute their export portion of this trade in the vessel of all nation that period having already expire the state of mutual interdiction have again take place the british government have not only decline negotiation upon this subject but by the principle they have assume with reference to it have preclude even the mean of negotiation it become not the self respect of the united states either to solicit gratuitous favor or to accept as the grant of a favor that for which an ample equivalent be exact it remain to be determine by the respective government whether the trade shall be open by act of reciprocal legislation it be in the mean time satisfactory to know that apart from the inconvenience result from a disturbance of the usual channel of trade no loss have be sustain by the commerce the navigation or the revenue of the united states and none of magnitude be to be apprehend from this exist state of mutual interdict with the other maritime and commercial nation of europe our intercourse continue with little variation since the cessation by the convention of 1822 06 24 of all discriminating duty upon the vessel of the united states and of france in either country our trade with that nation have increase and be increase a disposition on the part of france have be manifest to renew that negotiation and in accede to the proposal we have express the wish that it might be extend to other subject upon which a good understanding between the party would be beneficial to the interest of both the origin of the political relation between the united states and france be coeval with the first year of our independence the memory of it be interweave with that of our arduous struggle for national existence weaken as it have occasionally be since that time it can by we never be forget and we should hail with exultation the moment which should indicate a recollection equally friendly in spirit on the part of france a fresh effort have recently be make by the minister of the united states reside at paris to obtain a consideration of the just claim of citizen of the united states to the reparation of wrong long since commit many of they frankly acknowledge and all of they entitle upon every principle of justice to a candid examination the proposal last make to the french government have be to refer the subject which have form an obstacle to this consideration to the determination of a sovereign the common friend of both to this offer no definitive answer have yet be receive but the gallant and honorable spirit which have at all time be the pride and glory of france will not ultimately permit the demand of innocent sufferer to be extinguish in the mere consciousness of the power to reject they a new treaty of amity navigation and commerce have be conclude with the kingdom of sweden which will be submit to the senate for their advice with regard to its ratification at a more recent date a minister plenipotentiary from the hanseatic republics of hamburg lubeck and bremen have be receive charge with a special mission for the negotiation of a treaty of amity and commerce between that ancient and renowned league and the united states this negotiation have accordingly be commence and be now in progress the result of which will if successful be also submit to the senate for their consideration since the accession of the emperor nicholas to the imperial throne of all the russias the friendly disposition toward the united states so constantly manifest by his predecessor have continue unabated and have be recently testify by the appointment of a minister plenipotentiary to reside at this place from the interest take by this sovereign in behalf of the suffer greeks and from the spirit with which other of the great european power be cooperate with he the friend of freedom and of humanity may indulge the hope that they will obtain relief from that most unequal of conflict which they have so long and so gallantly sustain that they will enjoy the blessing of self government which by their suffering in the cause of liberty they have richly earn and that their independence will be secure by those liberal institution of which their country furnish the early example in the history of man kind and which have consecrate to immortal remembrance the very soil for which they be now again profusely pour forth their blood the sympathy which the people and government of the united states have so warmly indulge with their cause have be acknowledge by their government in a letter of thank which i have receive from their illustrious president a translation of which be now communicate to congress the representative of that nation to whom this tribute of gratitude be intend to be pay and to whom it be justly due in the american hemisphere the cause of freedom and independence have continue to prevail and if signalize by none of those splendid triumph which have crown with glory some of the precede year it have only be from the banishment of all external force against which the struggle have be maintain the shout of victory have be supersede by the expulsion of the enemy over whom it could have be achieve our friendly wish and cordial good will which have constantly follow the southern nation of america in all the vicissitude of their war of independence be succeed by a solicitude equally ardent and cordial that by the wisdom and purity of their institution they may secure to themselves the choice blessing of social order and the good reward of virtuous liberty disclaim alike all right and all intention of interfere in those concern which it be the prerogative of their independence to regulate as to they shall seem fit we hail with joy every indication of their prosperity of their harmony of their persevering and inflexible homage to those principle of freedom and of equal right which be alone suit to the genius and temper of the american nation it have be therefore with some concern that we have observe indication of intestine division in some of the republics of the south and appearance of less union with one another than we believe to be the interest of all among the result of this state of thing have be that the treaty conclude at panama do not appear to have be ratify by the contracting party and that the meeting of the congress at tacubaya have be indefinitely postpone in accept the invitation to be represent at this congress while a manifestation be intend on the part of the united states of the most friendly disposition toward the southern republics by whom it have be propose it be hope that it would furnish an opportunity for bring all the nation of this hemisphere to the common acknowledgment and adoption of the principle in the regulation of their internal relation which would have secure a last peace and harmony between they and have promote the cause of mutual benevolence throughout the globe but as obstacle appear to have arise to the reassembling of the congress one of the 2 minister commission on the part of the united states have return to the bosom of his country while the minister charge with the ordinary mission to mexico remain authorize to attend the conference of the congress when ever they may be resume a hope be for a short time entertain that a treaty of peace actually sign between the government of buenos ayres and of brazil would supersede all further occasion for those collision between belligerent pretension and neutral right which be so commonly the result of maritime war and which have unfortunately disturb the harmony of the relation between the united states and the brazilian government at their last session congress be inform that some of the naval officer of that empire have advance and practice upon principle in relation to blockade and to neutral navigation which we could not sanction and which our commander find it necessary to resist it appear that they have not be sustain by the government of brazil itself some of the vessel capture under the assumed authority of these erroneous principle have be restore and we trust that our just expectation will be realize that adequate indemnity will be make to all the citizen of the united states who have suffer by the unwarranted capture which the brazilian tribunal themselves have pronounce unlawful in the diplomatic discussion at rio de janeiro of these wrong sustain by citizen of the united states and of other which seem as if emanate immediately from that government itself the charge d'affaires of the united states under an impression that his representation in behalf of the right and interest of his country man be totally disregarded and useless deem it his duty without wait for instruction to terminate his official function to demand his pass- port and return to the united states this movement dictate by an honest zeal for the honor and interest of his country motive which operate exclusively on the mind of the officer who resort to it have not be disapprove by i the brazilian government however complain of it as a measure for which no adequate intentional cause have be give by they and upon an explicit assurance through their charge d'affaire reside here that a successor to the late representative of the united states near that government the appointment of whom they desire should be receive and treat with the respect due to his character and that indemnity should be promptly make for all injury inflict on citizen of the united states or their property contrary to the law of nation a temporary commission as charge d'affaire to that country have be issue which it be hope will entirely restore the ordinary diplomatic intercourse between the 2 government and the friendly relation between their respective nation turn from the momentous concern of our union in its intercourse with foreign nation to those of the deep interest in the administration of our internal affair we find the revenue of the present year correspond as nearly as might be expect with the anticipation of the last and present an aspect still more favorable in the promise of the next the balance in the treasury on 1827 01 01 be $ 6,358,686.18 the receipt from that day to 1827 09 30 as near as the return of they yet receive can show amount to $ 16,886,581.32 the receipt of the present quarter estimate at $ 4,515,000 add to the above form an aggregate of $ 21,400,000 of receipt the expenditure of the year may perhaps amount to $ 22,300,000 present a small excess over the receipt but of these $ 22,000,000 upward of $ 6,000,000 have be apply to the discharge of the principal of the public debt the whole amount of which approach $ 74,000,000 on 1827 01 01 will on 1828 01 01 fall short of $ 67,500,000 the balance in the treasury on 1828 01 01 it be expect will exceed $ 5,450,000 a sum exceed that of 1825 01 01 though fall short of that exhibit on 1827 01 01 it be foresee that the revenue of the present year 1827 would not equal that of the last which have itself be less than that of the next precede year but the hope have be realize which be entertain that these deficiency would in no wise interrupt the steady operation of the discharge of the public debt by the annual $ 10,000,000 devote to that object by the act of 1817 03 03 the amount of duty secure on merchandise import from the commencement of the year until 1827 09 30 be $ 21,226,000 and the probably amount of that which will be secure during the remainder of the year be $ 5,774,000 form a sum total of $ 27,000,000 with the allowance for draw back and contingent deficiency which may occur though not specifically foresee we may safely estimate the receipt of the ensue year at $ 22,300,000 a revenue for the next equal to the expenditure of the present year the deep solicitude feel by our citizen of all class throughout the union for the total discharge of the public debt will apologize for the earnestness with which i deem it my duty to urge this topic upon the consideration of congress of recommend to they again the observance of the strict economy in the application of the public fund the depression upon the receipt of the revenue which have commence with the year 1826 continue with increase severity during the two first quarter of the present year the return tide begin to flow with the third quarter and so far as we can judge from experience may be expect to continue through the course of the ensue year in the mean time an alleviation from the burden of the public debt will in the three year have be effect to the amount of nearly $ 16,000,000 and the charge of annual interest will have be reduce upward of $ 1,000,000 but among the maxim of political economy which the steward of the public money should never suffer without urgent necessity to be transcend be that of keep the expenditure of the year within the limit of its receipt the appropriation of the two last year include the yearly $ 10,000,000 of the sink fund have each equal the promise revenue of the ensue year while we foresee with confidence that the public coffer will be replenish from the receipt as fast as they will be drain by the expenditure equal in amount to those of the current year it should not be forget that they could ill suffer the exhaustion of large disbursement the condition of the army and of all the branch of the public service under the superintendence of the secretary of war will be see by the report from that officer and the document with which it be accompany during the last summer a detachment of the army have be usefully and successfully call to perform their appropriate duty at the moment when the commissioner appoint for carry into execution certain provision of the treaty of 1825 08 19 with various tribe of the northwestern indians be about to arrive at the appoint place of meet the unprovoked murder of several citizen and other act of unequivocal hostility commit by a party of the winnebago tribe one of those associate in the treaty follow by indication of a menacing character among other tribe of the same region render necessary an immediate display of the defensive and protective force of the union in that quarter it be accordingly exhibit by the immediate and concerted movement of the governor of the state of illinois and of the territory of michigan and competent levy of militia under their authority with a corps of 700 man of united states troop under the command of general atkinson who at the call of governor cass immediately repair to the scene of danger from their station at st. louis their presence dispel the alarm of our fellow citizen on those disorder and overawe the hostile purpose of the indians the perpetrator of the murder be surrender to the authority and operation of our law and every appearance of purposed hostility from those indian tribe have subside although the present organization of the army and the administration of its various branch of service be upon the whole satisfactory they be yet susceptible of much improvement in particular some of which have be heretofore submit to the consideration of congress and other be now first present in the report of the secretary of war the expediency of provide for additional number of officer in the two corp of engineer will in some degree depend upon the number and extent of the object of national importance upon which congress may think it proper that survey should be make conformably to the act of 1824 04 30 of the survey which before the last session of congress have be make under the

in the progress of preparation and most of they may be complete before the close of this session all the officer of both corp of engineer with several other person duly qualified have be constantly employ upon these service from the passage of the act of 1824 04 30 to this time be no other advantage to accrue to the country from their labor than the fund of topographical knowledge which they have collect and communicate that alone would have be a profit to the union more than adequate to all the expenditure which have be devote to the object but the appropriation for the repair and continuation of the cumberland road for the construction of various other road for the removal of obstruction from the river and harbor for the erection of light house beacon pier and buoy and for the completion of canal undertake by individual association but need the assistance of mean and resource more comprehensive than individual enterprise can command may be consider rather as treasure lay up

condition of that department as highly satisfactory for the present and still more promising for the future its receipt for the year end 1827 07 01 amount to $ 1,473,551 and exceed its expenditure by upward of $ 100,000 it can not be an over sanguine estimate to predict that in less than 10 year of which half have elapse the receipt will have be more than double in the mean time a reduce expenditure upon establish route have keep pace with increase facility of public accommodation and additional service have be obtain at reduce rate of compensation within the last year the transportation of the mail in stage have be greatly augmented the number of post office have be increase to 7,000 and it may be anticipate that while the facility of intercourse between fellow citizen in person or by correspondence will soon be carry to the door of every villager in the union a yearly surplus of revenue will accrue which may be apply as the wisdom of congress under the exercise of their constitutional power may devise for the further establishment and improvement of the public road or by add still far to the facility in the transportation of the mail of the indication of the prosperous condition of our country none can be more pleasing than those present by the multiplying relation of personal and intimate intercourse between the citizen of the union dwelling at the remotest distance from each other among the subject which have heretofore occupy the earnest solicitude and attention of congress be the management and disposal of that portion of the property of the nation which consist of the public land the acquisition of they make at the expense of the whole union not only in treasury but in blood mark a right of property in they equally extensive by the report and statement from the general land office now communicate it appear that under the present government of the united states a sum little short of $ 33,000,000 have be pay from the common treasury for that portion of this property which have be purchase from france and spain and for the extinction of the aboriginal title the amount of land acquire be near 260,000,000 acre of which on 1826 01 01 about 139,000,000 acre have be survey and little more than 19,000,000 acre have be sell the amount pay into the treasury by the purchaser of the public land sell be not yet equal to the sum pay for the whole but leave a small balance to be refund the proceed of the sale of the land have long be pledge to the creditor of the nation a pledge from which we have reason to hope that they will in a very few year be redeem the system upon which this great national interest have be manage be the result of long anxious and persevere deliberation mature and modify by the progress of our population and the lesson of experience it have be hitherto eminently successful more than 9/10 of the land still remain the common property of the union the appropriation and disposal of which be sacred trust in the hand of congress of the land sell a considerable part be convey under extend credit which in the vicissitude and fluctuation in the value of land and of their produce become oppressively burdensome to the purchaser it can never be the interest or the policy of the nation to wring from its own citizen the reasonable profit of their industry and enterprise by hold they to the rigorous import of disastrous engagement in 1821 03 a debt of $ 22,000,000 due by purchaser of the public land have accumulate which they be unable to pay an act of congress of 1821 03 02 come to their relief and have be succeed by other the late be the act of 1826 05 04 the indulgent provision of which expire on 1827 07 04 the effect of these law have be to reduce the debt from the purchaser to a remain balance of about $ 4,300,000 due more than 3/5 of which be for land within the state of alabama i recommend to congress the revival and continuance for a further term of the beneficent accommodation to the public debtor of that statute and submit to their consideration in the same spirit of equity the remission under proper discrimination of the forfeiture of partial payment on account of purchase of the public land so far as to allow of their application to other payment there be various other subject of deep interest to the whole union which have heretofore be recommend to the consideration of congress as well by my predecessor as under the impression of the duty devolve upon i by myself among these be the debt rather of justice than gratitude to the survive warrior of the revolutionary war the extension of the judicial administration of the federal government to those extensive since the organization of the present judiciary establishment now constitute at least 1/3 of its territory power and population the formation of a more effective and uniform system for the government of the militia and the amelioration in some form or modification of the diversified and often oppressive code relate to insolvency amidst the multiplicity of topic of great national concernment which may recommend themselves to the calm and patriotic deliberation of the legislature it may suffice to say that on these and all other measure which may receive their sanction my hearty cooperation will be give conformably to the duty enjoin upon i and under the sense of all the obligation prescribe by the constitution
fellow citizen of the senate and of the house of representatives if the enjoyment in profusion of the bounty of providence form a suitable subject of mutual gratulation and grateful acknowledgment we be admonish at this return of the season when the representative of the nation be assemble to deliberate upon their concern to offer up the tribute of fervent and grateful heart for the never fail mercy of he who ruleth over all he have again favor we with healthful season and abundant harvest he have sustain we in peace with foreign country and in tranquillity within our border he have preserve we in the quiet and undisturbed possession of civil and religious liberty he have crown the year with his goodness impose on we no other condition than of improve for our own happiness the blessing bestow by his hand and in the fruition of all his favor of devote his faculty with which we have be endow by he to his glory and to our own temporal and eternal welfare in the relation of our federal union with our brother of the human race the change which have occur since the close of your last session have generally tend to the preservation of peace and to the cultivation of harmony before your last separation a war have unhappily be kindle between the empire of russia one of those with which our intercourse have be no other than a constant exchange of good office and that of the ottoman porte a nation from which geographical distance religious opinion and maxim of government on their part little suited to the formation of those bond of mutual benevolence which result from the benefit of commerce have department we in a state perhaps too much prolonged of coldness and alienation the extensive fertile and populous dominion of the sultan belong rather to the asiatic than the european division of the human family they enter but partially into the system of europe nor have their war with russia and austria the european states upon which they border for more than a century past disturb the pacific relation of those states with the other great power of europe neither france nor prussia nor great britain have ever take part in they nor be it to be expect that they will at this time the declaration of war by russia have receive the approbation or acquiescence of her ally and we may indulge the hope that its progress and termination will be signalize by the moderation and forbearance no less than by the energy of the emperor nicholas and that it will afford the opportunity for such collateral agency in behalf of the suffer greeks as will secure to they ultimately the triumph of humanity and of freedom the state of our particular relation with france have scarcely vary in the course of the present year the commercial intercourse between the two country have continue to increase for the mutual benefit of both the claim of indemnity to number of our fellow citizen for depredation upon their property heretofore commit during the revolutionary government remain unadjusted and still form the subject of earnest representation and remonstrance recent advice from the minister of the united states at paris encourage the expectation that the appeal to the justice of the french government will ere long receive a favorable consideration the last friendly expedient have be resort to for the decision of the controversy with great britain relate to the northeastern boundary of the united states by an agreement with the british government carry into effect the provision of the fifth article of the treaty of ghent and the convention of 1827 09 29 his majesty the king of the netherlands have by common consent be select as the umpire between the party the proposal to he to accept the designation for the performance of this friendly office will be make at an early day and the united states rely upon the justice of their cause will cheerfully commit the arbitrament of it to a prince equally distinguished for the independence of his spirit his indefatigable assiduity to the duty of his station and his inflexible personal probity our commercial relation with great britain will deserve the serious consideration of congress and the exercise of a conciliatory and forbearing spirit in the policy of both government the state of they have be materially change by the act of congress pass at their last session in alteration of several act impose duty on import and by act of more recent date of the british parliament the effect of the interdiction of direct trade commence by great britain and reciprocate by the united states have be as be to be foresee only to substitute different channel for an exchange of commodity indispensable to the colony and profitable to a numerous class of our fellow citizen the export the revenue the navigation of the united states have suffer no diminution by our exclusion from direct access to the british colony the colony pay more dearly for the necessary of life which their government burden with the charge of double voyage freight insurance and commission and the profit of our export be somewhat impaired and more injuriously transfer from one portion of our citizen to another the resumption of this old and otherwise explode system of colonial exclusion have not secure to the shipping interest of great britain the relief which at the expense of the distant colony and of the united states it be expect to afford other measure have be resort to more pointedly bear upon the navigation of the united states and more pointedly bear upon the navigation of the united states and which unless modify by the construction give to the recent act of parliament will be manifestly incompatible with the positive stipulation of the commercial convention exist between the two country that convention however may be terminate with 12 month notice at the option of either party a treaty of amity navigation and commerce between the united states and his majesty the emperor of austria king of hungary and bohemia have be prepare for signature by the secretary of state and by the baron de lederer intrust with full power of the austrian government independently of the new and friendly relation which may be thus commence with one of the most eminent and powerful nation of the earth the occasion have be take in it as in other recent treaty conclude by the united states to extend those principle of liberal intercourse and of fair reciprocity which intertwine with the exchange of commerce the principle of justice and the feeling of mutual benevolence this system first proclaim to the world in the first commercial treaty ever conclude by the united states&mdash;that of 1778 02 06 with france&mdash;has be invariably the cherished policy of our union it be by treaty of commerce alone that it can be make ultimately to prevail as the establish system of all civilized nation with this principle our father extend the hand of friendship to every nation of the globe and to this policy our country have ever since adhere what ever of regulation in our law have ever be adopt unfavorable to the interest of any foreign nation have be essentially defensive and counteract to similar regulation of theirs operate against we immediately after the close of the war of independence commissioner be appoint by the congress of the confederation authorize to conclude treaty with every nation of europe dispose to adopt they before the war of the french revolution such treaty have be consummate with the united netherlands sweden and prussia during those war treaty with great britain and spain have be effect and those with prussia and france renew in all these some concession to the liberal principle of intercourse propose by the united states have be obtain but as in all the negotiation they come occasionally in collision with previous internal regulation or exclusive and exclude compact of monopoly with which the other party have be trammel the advance make in they toward the freedom of trade be partial and imperfect colonial establishment chartered company and ship building influence pervade and encumber the legislation of all the great commercial state and the united states in offer free trade and equal privilege to all be compel to acquiesce in many exception with each of the party to their treaty accommodate to their exist law and anterior agreement the colonial system by which this whole hemisphere be bind have fall into ruin totally abolish by revolution convert colony into independent nation throughout the two american continent except a portion of territory chiefly at the northern extremity of our own and confine to the remnant of dominion retain by great britain over the insular archipelago geographically the appendage of our part of the globe with all the rest we have free trade even with the insular colony of all the european nation except great britain her government also have manifest approach to the adoption of a free and liberal intercourse between her colony and other nation though by a sudden and scarcely explain revulsion the spirit of exclusion have be revive for operation upon the united states alone the conclusion of our last treaty of peace with great britain be shortly afterwards follow by a commercial convention place the direct intercourse between the two country upon a footing of more equal reciprocity than have ever before be admit the same principle have since be much far extend by treaty with france sweden denmark the hanseatic city prussia in europe and with the republics of colombia and of central america in this hemisphere the mutual abolition of discriminating duty and charge upon the navigation and commercial intercourse between the party be the general maxim which characterize they all there be reason to expect that it will at no distant period be adopt by other nation both of europe and america and to hope that by its universal prevalence one of the fruitful source of war of commercial competition will be extinguish among the nation upon whose government many of our fellow citizen have have long pende claim of indemnity for depredation upon their property during a period when the right of neutral commerce be disregard be that of denmark they be soon after the event occur the subject of a special mission from the united states at the close of which the assurance be give by his danish majesty that at a period of more tranquillity and of less distress they would be consider examine and decide upon in a spirit of determine purpose for the dispensation of justice i have much pleasure in inform congress that the fulfillment of this honorable promise be now in progress that a small portion of the claim have already be settle to the satisfaction of the claimant and that we have reason to hope that the remainder will shortly be place in a train of equitable adjustment this result have always be confidently expect from the character of personal integrity and of benevolence which the sovereign of the danish dominion have through every vicissitude of fortune maintain the general aspect of the affair of our neighboring american nation of the south have be rather of approach than of settled tranquillity internal disturbance have be more frequent among they than their common friend would have desire our intercourse with all have continue to be that of friendship and of mutual good will treaty of commerce and of boundary with the united mexican states have be negotiate but from various successive obstacle not yet bring to a final conclusion the civil war which unfortunately still prevail in the republic of central america have be unpropitious to the cultivation of our commercial relation with they and the dissension and revolutionary change in the republic of colombia and of peru have be see with cordial regret by we who would gladly contribute to the happiness of both it be with great satisfaction however that we have witness the recent conclusion of a peace between the government of buenos aires and of brazil and it be equally gratifying to observe that indemnity have be obtain for some of the injury which our fellow citizen have sustain in the latter of those country the rest be in a train of negotiation which we hope may terminate to mutual satisfaction and that it may be succeed by a treaty of commerce and navigation upon liberal principle propitious to a great and grow commerce already important to the interest of our country the condition and prospect of the revenue be more favorable than our most sanguine expectation have anticipate the balance in the treasury on 1828 01 01 exclusive of the money receive under the convention of 1826 11 13 with great britain be $ 5,861,972.83 the receipt into the treasury from 1828 01 01 to 1828 09 30 so far as they have be ascertain to form the basis of an estimate amount to $ 18,633,580.27 which with the receipt of the present quarter estimate at $ 5,461,283.40 form an aggregate of receipt during the year of $ 24,094,863.67 the expenditure of the year may probably amount to $ 25,637,111.63 and leave in the treasury on 1829 01 01 the sum of $ 5,125,638.14.the receipt of the present year have amount to near $ 2,000,000 more than be anticipate at the commencement of the last session of congress the amount of duty secure on importation from the first of january to the 30th of september be about $ 22,997,000 and that of the estimate accrue revenue be $ 5,000,000 form an aggregate for the year of near $ 28,000,000 this be $ 1,000,000 more than the estimate last december for the accruing revenue of the present year which with allowance for draw back and contingent deficiency be expect to produce an actual revenue of $ 22,300,000 have these only be realize the expenditure of the year would have be also proportionally reduce for of these $ 24,000,000 receive upward of $ 9,000,000 have be apply to the extinction of public debt bear an interest of 6 percent a year and of course reduce the burden of interest annually payable in future by the amount of more than $ 500,000 the payment on account of interest during the current year exceed $ 3,000,000 present an aggregate of more than $ 12,000,000 apply during the year to the discharge of the public debt the whole of which remain due on 1829 01 01 will amount only to $ 58,362,135.78.that the revenue of the ensue year will not fall short of that receive in the one now expire there be indication which can scarcely prove deceptive in our country an uniform experience of 40 year have show that what ever the tariff of duty upon article import from abroad have be the amount of importation have always bear an average value nearly approach to that of the export though occasionally differ in the balance some time be more and some time less it be indeed a general law of prosperous commerce that the real value of export should by a small and only a small balance exceed that of import that balance be a permanent addition to the wealth of the nation the extent of the prosperous commerce of the nation must be regulate by the amount of its export and an important addition to the value of these will draw after it a corresponding increase of importation it have happen in the vicissitude of the season that the harvest of all europe have in the late summer and autumn fall short of their usual average a relaxation of the interdict upon the importation of grain and flour from abroad have ensue a propitious market have be open to the granary of our country and a new prospect of reward present to the labor of the husband man which for several year have be deny this accession to the profit of agriculture in the middle and western portion of our union be accidental and temporary it may continue only for a single year it may be as have be often experience in the revolution of time but the first of several scanty harvest in succession we may consider it certain that for the approach year it have add an item of large amount to the value of our export and that it will produce a corresponding increase of importation it may therefore confidently be foresee that the revenue of 1829 will equal and probably exceed that of 1828 and will afford the mean of extinguish $ 10,000,000 more of the principal of the public debt this new element of prosperity to that part of our agricultural industry which be occupy in produce the first article of human subsistence be of the most cheering character to the feeling of patriotism proceed from a cause which humanity will view with concern the suffering of scarcity in distant land it yield a consolatory reflection that this scarcity be in no respect attributable to we that it come from the dispensation of he who ordain all in wisdom and goodness and who permit evil itself only as an instrument of good that far from contribute to this scarcity our agency will be apply only to the alleviation of its severity and that in pour forth from the abundance of our own garner the supply which will partially restore plenty to those who be in need we shall ourselves reduce our store and add to the price of our own bread so as in some degree to participate in the want which it will be the good fortune of our country to relieve the great interest of an agricultural commercial and manufacturing nation be so link in union together that no permanent cause of prosperity to one of they can operate without extend its influence to the other all these interest be alike under the protect power of the legislative authority and the duty of the representative body be to conciliate they in harmony together so far as the object of taxation be to raise a revenue for discharge the debt and defray the expense of the community its operation should be adapt as much as possible to suit the burden with equal hand upon all in proportion with their ability of bear it without oppression but the legislation of one nation be some time intentionally make to bear heavily upon the interest of another that legislation adapt as it be mean to be to the special interest of its own people will often press most unequally upon the several component interest of its neighbor thus the legislation of great britain when as have recently be avow adapt to the depression of a rival nation will naturally abound with regulation to interdict upon the production of the soil or industry of the other which come in competition with its own and will present encouragement perhaps even bounty to the raw material of the other state which it can not produce itself and which be essential for the use of its manufacture competitor in the market of the world with those of its commercial rival such be the state of commercial legislation of great britain as it bear upon our interest it exclude with interdict duty all importation except in time of approach famine of the great staple of production of our middle and western state it proscribe with equal rigor the bulkier lumber and live stock of the same portion and also of the northern and eastern part of our union it refuse even the rice of the south unless aggravate with a charge of duty upon the northern carrier who bring it to they but the cotton indispensable for their loom they will receive almost duty free to weave it into a fabric for our own wear to the destruction of our own manufacture which they be enable thus to under sell be the self protect energy of this nation so helpless that there exist in the political institution of our country no power to counteract the bias of this foreign legislation that the grower of grain must submit to this exclusion from the foreign market of their produce that the shipper must dismantle their ship the trade of the north stagnate at the wharf and the manufacturer starve at their loom while the whole people shall pay tribute to foreign industry to be clothe in a foreign garb that the congress of the union be impotent to restore the balance in favor of native industry destroy by the statute of another realm?more just and generous sentiment will i trust prevail if the tariff adopt at the last session of congress shall be find by experience to bear oppressively upon the interest of any one section of the union it ought to be and i can not doubt will be so modify as to alleviate its burden to the voice of just complaint from any portion of their constituent the representative of the state and of the people will never turn away their ear but so long as the duty of the foreign shall operate only as a bounty upon the domestic article while the planter and the merchant and the shepherd and the husbandman shall be find thrive in their occupation under the duty impose for the protection of domestic manufacture they will not repine at the prosperity share with themselves by their fellow citizen of other profession nor denounce as violation of the constitution the deliberate act of congress to shield from the wrong of foreign the native industry of the union while the tariff of the last session of congress be a subject of legislative deliberation it be foretell by some of its opposer that one of its necessary consequence would be to impair the revenue it be yet too soon to pronounce with confidence that this prediction be erroneous the obstruction of one avenue of trade not unfrequently open an issue to another the consequence of the tariff will be to increase the exportation and to diminish the importation of some specific article but by the general law of trade the increase of exportation of one article will be follow by an increase importation of other the duty upon which will supply the deficiency which the diminish importation would otherwise occasion the effect of taxation upon revenue can seldom be foresee with certainty it must abide the test of experience as yet no symptom of diminution be perceptible in the receipt of the treasury as yet little addition of cost have even be experience upon the article burden with heavy duty by the last tariff the domestic manufacturer supply the same or a kindre article at a diminished price and the consumer pay the same tribute to the labor of his own country man which he must otherwise have pay to foreign industry and toil the tariff of the last session be in its detail not acceptable to the great interest of any portion of the union not even to the interest which it be specially intend to subserve its object be to balance the burden upon native industry impose by the operation of foreign law but not to aggravate the burden of one section of the union by the relief afford to another to the great principle sanction by that act&mdash;one of those upon which the constitution itself be formed&mdash;i hope and trust the authority of the union will adhere but if any of the duty impose by the act only relieve the manufacturer by aggravate the burden of the planter let a careful revisal of its provision enlighten by the practical experience of its effect be direct to retain those which impart protection to native industry and remove or supply the place of those which only alleviate one great national interest by the depression of another the united states of america and the people of every state of which they be compose be each of they sovereign power the legislative authority of the whole be exercise by congress under authority grant they in the common constitution the legislative power of each state be exercise by assembly derive their authority from the constitution of the state each be sovereign within its own province the distribution of power between they presuppose that these authority will move in harmony with each other the member of the state and general government be all under oath to support both and allegiance be due to the one and to the other the case of a conflict between these two power have not be suppose nor have any provision be make for it in our institution as a virtuous nation of ancient time exist more than five century without a law for the punishment of parricide more than once however in the progress of our history have the people and the legislature of one or more state in moment of excitement be instigate to this conflict and the mean of effecting this impulse have be allegation that the act of congress to be resist be unconstitutional the people of no one state have ever delegate to their legislature the power of pronounce an act of congress unconstitutional but they have delegate to they power by the exercise of which the execution of the law of congress within the state may be resist if we suppose the case of such conflict legislation sustain by the correspond executive and judicial authority patriotism and philanthropy turn their eye from the condition in which the party would be place and from that of the people of both which must be its victim the report from the secretary of war and the various subordinate office of the resort of that department present an exposition of the public administration of affair connect with they through the course of the current year the present state of the army and the distribution of the force of which it be compose will be see from the report of the major general several alteration in the disposal of the troop have be find expedient in the course of the year and the discipline of the army though not entirely free from exception have be generally good the attention of congress be particularly invite to that part of the report of the secretary of war which concern the exist system of our relation with the indian tribe at the establishment of the federal government under the present constitution of the united states the principle be adopt of consider they as foreign and independent power and also as proprietor of land they be moreover consider as savage whom it be our policy and our duty to use our influence in convert to christianity and in bring within the pale of civilization as independent power we negotiate with they by treaty as proprietor we purchase of they all the land which we could prevail upon they to sell as brother of the human race rude and ignorant we endeavor to bring they to the knowledge of religion and letter the ultimate design be to incorporate in our own institution that portion of they which could be convert to the state of civilization in the practice of european state before our revolution they have be consider as child to be govern as tenant at discretion to be dispossess as occasion might require as hunter to be indemnify by trifle concession for removal from the ground from which their game be extirpate in change the system it would seem as if a full contemplation of the consequence of the change have not be take we have be far more successful in the acquisition of their land than in impart to they the principle or inspire they with the spirit of civilization but in appropriating to ourselves their hunting ground we have bring upon ourselves the obligation of provide they with subsistence and when we have have the rare good fortune of teach they the art of civilization and the doctrine of christianity we have unexpectedly find they form in the midst of ourselves community claim to be independent of our and rival of sovereignty within the territory of the member of our union this state of thing require that a remedy should be provided&mdash;a remedy which while it shall do justice to those unfortunate child of nature may secure to the member of our confederation their right of sovereignty and of soil as the outline of a project to that effect the view present in the report of the secretary of war be recommend to the consideration of congress the report from the engineer department present a comprehensive view of the progress which have be make in the great system promotive of the public interest commence and organize under authority of congress and the effect of which have already contribute to the security as they will hereafter largely contribute to the honor and dignity of the nation the first of these great system be that of fortification commence immediately after the close of our last war under the salutary experience which the event of that war have impress upon our country man of its necessity introduce under the auspex of my immediate predecessor it have be continue with the persevering and liberal encouragement of the legislature and combine with corresponding exertion for the gradual increase and improvement of the navy prepare for our extensive country a condition of defense adapt to any critical emergency which the vary course of event may bring forth our advance in these concert system have for the last 10 year be steady and progressive and in a few year more will be so complete as to leave no cause for apprehension that our sea coast will ever again offer a theater of hostile invasion the next of these cardinal measure of policy be the preliminary to great and lasting work of public improvement in

population of the union have about thrice double the rate of increase of these office be nearly 40 and of the revenue and of travel mile from 20 to 25 for one the increase of revenue within the last five year have be nearly equal to the whole revenue of the department in 1812.the expenditure of the department during the year which end on 1828 07 01 have exceed the receipt by a sum of about $ 25,000 the excess have be occasion by the increase of mail conveyance and facility to the extent of near 800,000 mile it have be supply by collection from the post master of the arrearage of precede year while the correct principle seem to be that the income levy by the department should defray all its expense it have never be the policy of this government to raise from this establishment any revenue to be apply to any other purpose the suggestion of the postmaster general that the insurance of the safe transmission of money by the mail might be assume by the department for a moderate and competent remuneration will deserve the consideration of congress a report from the commissioner of the public building in this city exhibit the expenditure upon they in the course of the current year it will be see that the humane and benevolent intention of congress in provide by the act of 1826 05 20 for the erection of a penitentiary in this district have be accomplish the authority of further legislation be now require for the removal to this tenement of the offender against the law sentence to atone by personal confinement for their crime and to provide a code for their employment and government while thus confine the commissioner appoint conformably to the act of 1827 03 02 to provide for the adjustment of claim of person entitle to indemnification under the first article of the

to the report from the commissioner of the general land office present the actual condition of that common property of the union the amount pay into the treasury from the proceed of land during the year 1827 and for the first half of 1828 fall little short of $ 2,000,000 the propriety of far extend the time for the extinguishment of the debt due to the united states by the purchaser of the public land limit by the act of 1828 03 21 to 1829 07 04 will claim the consideration of congress to whose vigilance and careful attention the regulation disposal and preservation of this great national inheritance have by the people of the united states been intrust among the important subject to which the attention of the present congress have already be invite and which may occupy their further and deliberate discussion will be the provision to be make for take the fifth census of enumeration of the inhabitant of the united states the constitution of the united states require that this enumeration should be make within every term of 10 year and the date from which the last enumeration commence be the first monday of august of the year 1820.the law under which the former enumeration be take be enact at the session of congress immediately precede the operation but considerable inconvenience be experience from the delay of legislation to so late a period that law like those of the precede enumeration direct that the census should be take by the marshal of the several district and territory of the union under instruction from the secretary of state the preparation and transmission to the marshal of those instruction require more time than be then allow between the passage of the law and the day when the enumeration be to commence the term of six month limit for the return of the marshal be also find even then too short and must be more so now when an additional population of at least 3,000,000 must be present upon the return as they be to be make at the short session of congress it would as well as from other consideration be more convenient to commence the enumeration from an early period of the year than the first of august the most favorable season would be the spring on a review of the former enumeration it will be find that the plan for take every census have contain many improvement upon that of its predecessor the last be still susceptible of much improvement the third census be the first at which any account be take of the manufacture of the country it be repeat at the last enumeration but the return in both case be necessarily very imperfect they must always be so rest of course only upon the communication voluntarily make by individual interested in some of the manufacturing establishment yet they contain much valuable information and may by some supplementary provision of the law be render more effective the column of age commence from infancy have hitherto be confine to a few period all under the number of 45 year important knowledge would be obtain by extend these column in interval of 10 year to the utmost boundary of human life the labor of take they would be a trifling addition to that already prescribe and the result would exhibit comparative table of longevity highly interesting to the country i deem it my duty far to observe that much of the imperfection in the return of the last and perhaps of precede enumeration proceed from the inadequateness of the compensation allow to the marshal and their assistant in take they in close this communication it only remain for i to assure the legislature of my continue earnest wish for the adoption of measure recommend by i heretofore and yet to be act on by they and of the cordial concurrence on my part in every constitutional provision which may receive their sanction during the session tend to the general welfare
fellow citizen about to undertake the arduous duty that i have be appoint to perform by the choice of a free people i avail myself of this customary and solemn occasion to express the gratitude which their confidence inspire and to acknowledge the accountability which my situation enjoin while the magnitude of their interest convince i that no thank can be adequate to the honor they have confer it admonish i that the good return i can make be the zealous dedication of my humble ability to their service and their good   as the instrument of the federal constitution it will devolve on i for a stated period to execute the law of the united states to superintend their foreign and their confederate relation to manage their revenue to command their force and by communication to the legislature to watch over and to promote their interest generally and the principle of action by which i shall endeavor to accomplish this circle of duty it be now proper for i briefly to explain in administer the law of congress i shall keep steadily in view the limitation as well as the extent of the executive power trust thereby to discharge the function of my office without transcend its authority with foreign nation it will be my study to preserve peace and to cultivate friendship on fair and honorable term and in the adjustment of any difference that may exist or arise to exhibit the forbearance become a powerful nation rather than the sensibility belong to a gallant people in such measure as i may be call on to pursue in regard to the right of the separate states i hope to be animate by a proper respect for those sovereign member of our union take care not to confound the power they have reserve to themselves with those they have grant to the confederacy the management of the public revenue that search operation in all government be among the most delicate and important trust in ours and it will of course demand no inconsiderable share of my official solicitude under every aspect in which it can be consider it would appear that advantage must result from the observance of a strict and faithful economy this i shall aim at the more anxiously both because it will facilitate the extinguishment of the national debt the unnecessary duration of which be incompatible with real independence and because it will counteract that tendency to public and private profligacy which a profuse expenditure of money by the government be but too apt to engender powerful auxiliary to the attainment of this desirable end be to be find in the regulation provide by the wisdom of congress for the specific appropriation of public money and the prompt accountability of public officer with regard to a proper selection of the subject of impost with a view to revenue it would seem to i that the spirit of equity caution and compromise in which the constitution be form require that the great interest of agriculture commerce and manufacture should be equally favor and that perhaps the only exception to this rule should consist in the peculiar encouragement of any product of either of they that may be find essential to our national independence internal improvement and the diffusion of knowledge so far as they can be promote by the constitutional act of the federal government be of high importance consider stand army as dangerous to free government in time of peace i shall not seek to enlarge our present establishment nor disregard that salutary lesson of political experience which teach that the military should be hold subordinate to the civil power the gradual increase of our navy whose flag have display in distant clime our skill in navigation and our fame in arm the preservation of our fort arsenal and dockyard and the introduction of progressive improvement in the discipline and science of both branch of our military service be so plainly prescribe by prudence that i should be excuse for omit their mention soon than for enlarge on their importance but the bulwark of our defense be the national militia which in the present state of our intelligence and population must render we invincible as long as our government be administer for the good of the people and be regulate by their will as long as it secure to we the right of person and of property liberty of conscience and of the press it will be worth defend and so long as it be worth defend a patriotic militia will cover it with an impenetrable aegis partial injury and occasional mortification we may be subject to but a million of armed freeman possess of the mean of war can never be conquer by a foreign foe to any just system therefore calculate to strengthen this natural safeguard of the country i shall cheerfully lend all the aid in my power it will be my sincere and constant desire to observe toward the indian tribe within our limit a just and liberal policy and to give that humane and considerate attention to their right and their want which be consistent with the habit of our government and the feeling of our people the recent demonstration of public sentiment inscribe on the list of executive duty in character too legible to be overlook the task of reform which will require particularly the correction of those abuse that have bring the patronage of the federal government into conflict with the freedom of election and the counteraction of those cause which have disturb the rightful course of appointment and have place or continue power in unfaithful or incompetent hand in the performance of a task thus generally delineated i shall endeavor to select man whose diligence and talent will insure in their respective station able and faithful cooperation depend for the advancement of the public service more on the integrity and zeal of the public officer than on their number a diffidence perhaps too just in my own qualification will teach i to look with reverence to the example of public virtue leave by my illustrious predecessor and with veneration to the light that flow from the mind that found and the mind that reform our system the same diffidence induce i to hope for instruction and aid from the coordinate branch of the government and for the indulgence and support of my fellow citizen generally and a firm reliance on the goodness of that power whose providence mercifully protect our national infancy and have since uphold our liberty in various vicissitude encourage i to offer up my ardent supplication that he will continue to make our beloved country the object of his divine care and gracious benediction

our country exhibit the most cheering evidence of general welfare and progressive improvement turn our eye to other nation our great desire be to see our brother of the human race secure in the blessing enjoy by ourselves and advance in knowledge in freedom and in social happiness our foreign relation although in their general character pacific and friendly present subject of difference between we and other power of deep interest as well to the country at large as to many of our citizen to effect an adjustment of these shall continue to be the object of my earnest endeavor and not with stand the difficulty of the task i do not allow myself to apprehend unfavorable result bless as our country be with every thing which constitute national strength she be fully adequate to the maintenance of all her interest in discharge the responsible trust confide to the executive in this respect it be my settle purpose to ask nothing that be not clearly right and to submit to nothing that be wrong and i flatter myself that support by the other branch of the government and by the intelligence and patriotism of the people we shall be able under the protection of providence to cause all our just right to be respect of the unsettled matter between the united states and other power the most prominent be those which have for year be the subject of negotiation with england france and spain the late period at which our minister to those government leave the united states render it impossible at this early day to inform you of what have be do on the subject with which they have be respectively charge rely upon the justice of our view in relation to the point commit to negotiation and the reciprocal good feeling which characterize our intercourse with those nation we have the good reason to hope for a satisfactory adjustment of exist difference with great britain alike distinguish in peace and war we may look forward to year of peaceful honorable and elevated competition every thing in the condition and history of the two nation be calculate to inspire sentiment of mutual respect and to carry conviction to the mind of both that it be their policy to preserve the most cordial relation such be my own view and it be not to be doubt that such be also the prevail sentiment of our constituent although neither time nor opportunity have be afford for a full development of the policy which the present cabinet of great britain design to pursue toward this country i indulge the hope that it will be of a just and pacific character and if this anticipation be realize we may look with confidence to a speedy and acceptable adjustment of our affair under the convention for regulate the reference to arbitration of the dispute point of boundary under the fifth article of the treaty of ghent the proceeding have hitherto be conduct in that spirit of candor and liberality which ought ever to characterize the act of sovereign state seek to adjust by the most unexceptionable mean important and delicate subject of contention the first sentiment of the party have be exchange and the final replication on our part be in a course of preparation this subject have receive the attention demand by its great and peculiar importance to a patriotic member of this confederacy the exposition of our right already make be such as from the high reputation of the commissioner by whom it have be prepare we have a right to expect our interest at the court of the sovereign who have evince his friendly disposition by assume the delicate task of arbitration have be commit to a citizen of the state of maine whose character talent and intimate acquaintance with the subject eminently qualify he for so responsible a trust with full confidence in the justice of our cause and in the probity intelligence and uncompromise independence of the illustrious arbitrator we can have nothing to apprehend from the result from france our ancient ally we have a right to expect that justice which become the sovereign of a powerful intelligent and magnanimous people the beneficial effect produce by the commercial convention of 1822 limit as be its provision be too obvious not to make a salutary impression upon the mind of those who be charge with the administration of her government should this result induce a disposition to embrace to their full extent the wholesome principle which constitute our commercial policy our minister to that court will be find instruct to cherish such a disposition and to aid in conduct it to useful practical conclusion the claim of our citizen for depredation upon their property long since commit under the authority and in many instance by the express direction of the then exist government of france remain unsatisfied and must therefore continue to furnish a subject of unpleasant discussion and possible collision between the two government i cherish however a lively hope found as well on the validity of those claim and the establish policy of all enlighten government as on the known integrity of the french monarch that the injurious delay of the past will find redress in the equity of the future our minister have be instruct to press these demand on the french government with all the earnestness which be call for by their importance and irrefutable justice and in a spirit that will evince the respect which be due to the feeling of those from whom the satisfaction be require our minister recently appoint to spain have be authorize to assist in remove evil alike injurious to both country either by conclude a commercial convention upon liberal and reciprocal term or by urge the acceptance in their full extent of the mutually beneficial provision of our navigation act he have also be instruct to make a further appeal to the justice of spain in behalf of our citizen for indemnity for spoliation upon our commerce commit under her authority&mdash;an appeal which the pacific and liberal course observe on our part and a due confidence in the honor of that government authorize we to expect will not be make in vain with other european power our intercourse be on the most friendly footing in russia place by her territorial limit extensive population and great power high in the rank of nation the united states have always find a steadfast friend although her recent invasion of turkey awaken a lively sympathy for those who be expose to the desolation of war we can not but anticipate that the result will prove favorable to the cause of civilization and to the progress of human happiness the treaty of peace between these power having be ratify we can not be insensible to the great benefit to be derive by the commerce of the united states from unlock the navigation of the black sea a free passage into which be secure to all merchant vessel bind to port of russia under a flag at peace with the porte this advantage enjoy upon condition by most of the power of europe have hitherto be withhold from we during the past summer an antecedent but unsuccessful attempt to obtain it be renew under circumstance which promise the most favorable result although these result have fortunately be thus in part attain further facility to the enjoyment of this new field for the enterprise of our citizen be in my opinion sufficiently desirable to insure to they our most zealous attention our trade with austria although of secondary importance have be gradually increase and be now so extended as to deserve the foster care of the government a negotiation commence and nearly complete with that power by the late administration have be consummate by a treaty of amity navigation and commerce which will be lay before the senate during the recess of congress our diplomatic relation with portugal have be resume the peculiar state of thing in that country cause a suspension of the recognition of the representative who present himself until an opportunity be have to obtain from our official organ there information regard the actual and as far as practicable prospective condition of the authority by which the representative in question be appoint this information be receive the application of the establish rule of our government in like case be no long withhold considerable advance have be make during the present year in the adjustment of claim of our citizen upon denmark for spoliation but all that we have a right to demand from that government in their behalf have not yet be concede from the liberal footing however upon which this subject have with the approbation of the claimant be place by the government together with the uniformly just and friendly disposition which have be evince by his danish majesty there be a reasonable ground to hope that this single subject of difference will speedily be remove our relation with the barbary powers continue as they have long be of the most favorable character the policy of keep an adequate force in the mediterranean as security for the continuance of this tranquillity will be persevere in as well as a similar one for the protection of our commerce and fishery in the pacific the southern republics of our own hemisphere have not yet realize all the advantage for which they have be so long struggle we trust however that the day be not distant when the restoration of peace and internal quiet under permanent system of government secure the liberty and promote the happiness of the citizen will crown with complete success their long and arduous effort in the cause of self government and enable we to salute they as friendly rival in all that be truly great and glorious the recent invasion of mexico and the effect thereby produce upon her domestic policy must have a control influence upon the great question of south american emancipation we have see the fell spirit of civil dissension rebuke and perhaps for ever stifle in that republic by the love of independence if it be true as appearance strongly indicate the spirit of independence be the master spirit and if a correspond sentiment prevail in the other states this devotion to liberty can not be without a proper effect upon the counsel of the mother country the adoption by spain of a pacific policy toward her former colonies&mdash;an event console to humanity and a blessing to the world in which she herself can not fail largely to participate&mdash;may be most reasonably expect the claim of our citizen upon the south american government generally be in a train of settlement while the principal part of those upon brazil have be adjust and a decree in council order bond to be issue by the minister of the treasury for their amount have receive the sanction of his imperial majesty this event together with the exchange of the ratification of the treaty negotiate and conclude in 1828 happily terminate all serious cause of difference with that power measure have be take to place our commercial relation with peru upon a well footing than that upon which they have hitherto rest and if meet by a proper disposition on the part of that government important benefit may be secure to both country deeply interested as we be in the prosperity of our sister republic and more particularly in that of our immediate neighbor it would be most gratifying to i be i permit to say that the treatment which we have receive at her hand have be as universally friendly as the early and constant solicitude manifest by the united states for her success give we a right to expect but it become my duty to inform you that prejudice long indulge by a portion of the inhabitant of mexico against the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the united states have have an unfortunate influence upon the affair of the two country and have diminish that usefulness to his own which be justly to be expect from his talent and zeal to this cause in a great degree be to be impute the failure of several measure equally interesting to both party but particularly that of the mexican government to ratify a treaty negotiate and conclude in its own capital and under its own eye under these circumstance it appear expedient to give to mr. poinsett the option either to return or not as in his judgment the interest of his country might require and instruction to that end be prepare but before they could be dispatch a communication be receive from the government of mexico through its charge d'affaire here request the recall of our minister this be promptly comply with and a representative of a rank correspond with that of the mexican diplomatic agent near this government be appoint our conduct toward that republic have be uniformly of the most friendly character and having thus remove the only alleged obstacle to harmonious intercourse i can not but hope that an advantageous change will occur in our affair in justice to mr. poinsett it be proper to say that my immediate compliance with the application for his recall and the appointment of a successor be not to be ascribe to any evidence that the imputation of an improper interference by he in the local politic of mexico be well found nor to a want of confidence in his talent or integrity and to add that the truth of the charge have never be affirm by the federal government of mexico in its communication with we i consider it one of the most urgent of my duty to bring to your attention the propriety of amend that part of the constitution which relate to the election of president and vice president our system of government be by its framer deem an experiment and they therefore consistently provide a mode of remedy its defect to the people belong the right of elect their chief magistrate it be never design that their choice should in any case be defeat either by the intervention of electoral college or by the agency confide under certain contingency to the house of representatives experience prove that in proportion as agent to execute the will of the people be multiply there be danger of their wish be frustrate some may be unfaithful all be liable to err so far therefore as the people can with convenience speak it be safe for they to express their own will the number of aspirant to the presidency and the diversity of the interest which may influence their claim leave little reason to expect a choice in the first instance and in that event the election must devolve on the house of representatives where it be obvious the will of the people may not be always ascertain or if ascertain may not be regard from the mode of voting by state the choice be to be make by 24 vote and it may often occur that one of these will be control by an individual representative honor and office be at the disposal of the successful candidate repeat balloting may make it apparent that a single individual hold the cast in his hand may he not be tempt to name his reward?but even without corruption suppose the probity of the representative to be proof against the powerful motive by which it may be assail the will of the people be still constantly liable to be misrepresent one may err from ignorance of the wish of his constituent another from a conviction that it be his duty to be govern by his own judgment of the fitness of the candidate finally although all be inflexibly honest all accurately inform of the wish of their constituent yet under the present mode of election a minority may often elect a president and when this happen it may reasonably be expect that effort will be make on the part of the majority to rectify this injurious operation of their institution but although no evil of this character should result from such a perversion of the first principle of our system&mdash;that the majority be to govern&mdash;it must be very certain that a president elect by a minority can not enjoy the confidence necessary to the successful discharge of his duty in this as in all other matter of public concern policy require that as few impediment as possible should exist to the free operation of the public will let we then endeavor so to amend our system that the office of chief magistrate may not be confer upon any citizen but in pursuance of a fair expression of the will of the majority i would therefore recommend such an amendment of the constitution as may remove all intermediate agency in the election of the president and vice president the mode may be so regulated as to preserve to each state its present relative weight in the election and a failure in the first attempt may be provide for by confine the second to a choice between the two high candidate in connection with such an amendment it would seem advisable to limit the service of the chief magistrate to a single term of either four or six year if however it should not be adopt it be worthy of consideration whether a provision disqualify for office the representatives in congress on whom such an election may have devolve would not be proper while member of congress can be constitutionally appoint to office of trust and profit it will be the practice even under the most conscientious adherence to duty to select they for such station as they be believe to be well qualified to fill than other citizen but the purity of our government would doubtless be promote by their exclusion from all appointment in the gift of the president in whose election they may have be officially concern the nature of the judicial office and the necessity of securing in the cabinet and in diplomatic station of the high rank the good talent and political experience should perhaps except these from the exclusion there be perhaps few man who can for any great length of time enjoy office and power without be more or less under the influence of feeling unfavorable to the faithful discharge of their public duty their integrity may be proof against improper consideration immediately address to themselves but they be apt to acquire a habit of look with indifference upon the public interest and of tolerate conduct from which an unpracticed man would revolt office be consider as a species of property and government rather as a means of promote individual interest than as an instrument create solely for the service of the people corruption in some and in other a perversion of correct feeling and principle divert government from its legitimate end and make it an engine for the support of the few at the expense of the many the duty of all public officer be or at least admit of be make so plain and simple that man of intelligence may readily qualify themselves for their performance and i can not but believe that more be lose by the long continuance of man in office than be generally to be gain by their experience i submit therefore to your consideration whether the efficiency of the government would not be promote and official industry and integrity well secure by a general extension of the law which limit appointment to four year in a country where office be create solely for the benefit of the people no one man have any more intrinsic right to official station than another office be not establish to give support to particular man at the public expense no individual wrong be therefore do by removal since neither appointment to nor continuance in office be a matter of right the incumbent become an officer with a view to public benefit and when these require his removal they be not to be sacrifice to private interest it be the people and they alone who have a right to complain when a bad officer be substitute for a good one he who be remove have the same mean of obtain a living that be enjoy by the million who never hold office the propose limitation would destroy the idea of property now so generally connect with official station and although individual distress may be some time produce it would by promote that rotation which constitute a lead principle in the republican creed give healthful action to the system no very considerable change have occur during the recess of congress in the condition of either our agriculture commerce or manufacture the operation of the tariff have not prove so injurious to the two former or as beneficial to the latter as be anticipate importation of foreign good have not be sensibly diminish while domestic competition under an illusive excitement have increase the production much beyond the demand for home consumption the consequence have be low price temporary embarrassment and partial loss that such of our manufacturing establishment as be base upon capital and be prudently manage will survive the shock and be ultimately profitable there be no good reason to doubt to regulate its conduct so as to promote equally the prosperity of these three cardinal interest be one of the most difficult task of government and it may be regret that the complicated restriction which now embarrass the intercourse of nation could not by common consent be abolish and commerce allow to flow in those channel to which individual enterprise always its sure guide might direct it but we must ever expect selfish legislation in other nation and be therefore compel to adapt our own to their regulation in the manner well calculate to avoid serious injury and to harmonize the conflict interest of our agriculture our commerce and our manufacture under these impression i invite your attention to the exist tariff believe that some of its provision require modification the general rule to be apply in graduate the duty upon article of foreign growth or manufacture be that which will place our own in fair competition with those of other country and the inducement to advance even a step beyond this point be control in regard to those article which be of primary necessity in time of war when we reflect upon the difficulty and delicacy of this operation it be important that it should never be attempt but with the utmost caution frequent legislation in regard to any branch of industry affect its value and by which its capital may be transfer to new channel must always be productive of hazardous speculation and loss in deliberate therefore on these interesting subject local feeling and prejudice should be merge in the patriotic determination to promote the great interest of the whole all attempt to connect they with the party conflict of the day be necessarily injurious and should be discountenance our action upon they should be under the control of high and purer motive legislation subject to such influence can never be just and will not long retain the sanction of a people whose active patriotism be not bound by sectional limit nor insensible to that spirit of concession and forbearance which give life to our political compact and still sustain it discard all calculation of political ascendancy the north the south the east and the west should unite in diminish any burthen of which either may justly complain the agricultural interest of our country be so essentially connect with every other and so superior in importance to they all that it be scarcely necessary to invite to it your particular attention it be principally as manufacture and commerce tend to increase the value of agricultural production and to extend their application to the want and comfort of society that they deserve the foster care of government look forward to the period not far distant when a sink fund will no long be require the duty on those article of importation which can not come in competition with our own production be the first that should engage the attention of congress in the modification of the tariff of these tea and coffee be the most important they enter largely into the consumption of the country and have become article of necessity to all class a reduction therefore of the exist duty will be feel as a common benefit but like all other legislation connect with commerce to be efficacious and not injurious it should be gradual and certain the public prosperity be evince in the increase revenue arise from the sale of the public land and in the steady maintenance of that produce by impost and tonnage not withstand the additional duty impose by the act of 1828 05 19 and the unusual importation in the early part of that year the balance in the treasury on 1829 01 01 be $ 5,972,435.81 the receipt of the current year be estimate at $ 24,602,230 and the expenditure for the same time at $ 26,164,595 leave a balance in the treasury on 1830 01 01 of $ 4,410,070.81.there will have be pay on account of the public debt during the present year the sum of $ 12,405,005.80 reduce the whole debt of the government on 1830 01 01 to $ 48,565,406.50 include $ 7 million of the 5 percent stock subscribe to the bank of the united states the payment on account of public debt make on 1829 07 01 be $ 8,715,462.87 it be apprehend that the sudden withdrawal of so large a sum from the bank in which it be deposit at a time of unusual pressure in the money market might cause much injury to the interest dependent on bank accommodation but this evil be wholly avert by an early anticipation of it at the treasury aid by the judicious arrangement of the officer of the bank of the united states this state of the finance exhibit the resource of the nation in an aspect highly flattering to its industry and auspicious of the ability of government in a very short time to extinguish the public debt when this shall be do our population will be relieve from a considerable portion of its present burthen and will find not only new motive to patriotic affection but additional mean for the display of individual enterprise the fiscal power of the state will also be increase and may be more extensively exert in favor of education and other public object while ample mean will remain in the federal government to promote the general weal in all the mode permit to its authority after the extinction of the public debt it be not probable that any adjustment of the tariff upon principle satisfactory to the people of the union will until a remote period if ever leave the government without a considerable surplus in the treasury beyond what may be require for its current service as then the period approach when the application of the revenue to the payment of debt will cease the disposition of the surplus will present a subject for the serious deliberation of congress and it may be fortunate for the country that it be yet to be decide consider in connection with the difficulty which have heretofore attend appropriation for purpose of internal improvement and with those which this experience tell we will certainly arise when ever power over such subject may be exercise by the central government it be hope that it may lead to the adoption of some plan which will reconcile the diversified interest of the state and strengthen the bond which unite they every member of the union in peace and in war will be benefit by the improvement of inland navigation and the construction of high way in the several state let we then endeavor to attain this benefit in a mode which will be satisfactory to all that hitherto adopt have by many of our fellow citizen be deprecate as an infraction of the constitution while by other it have be view as inexpedient all feel that it have be employ at the expense of harmony in the legislative council to avoid these evil it appear to i that the most safe just and federal disposition which could be make of the surplus revenue would be its apportionment among the several state accord to their ratio of representation and should this measure not be find warrant by the constitution that it would be expedient to propose to the state an amendment authorizing it i regard an appeal to the source of power in case of real doubt and where its exercise be deem indispensable to the general welfare as among the most sacred of all our obligation upon this country more than any other have in the providence of god be cast the special guardianship of the great principle of adherence to write constitution if it fail here all hope in regard to it will be extinguish that this be intend to be a government of limited and specific and not general power must be admit by all and it be our duty to preserve for it the character intend by its framer if experience point out the necessity for an enlargement of these power let we apply for it to those for whose benefit it be to be exercise and not undermine the whole system by a resort to over strain construction the scheme have work well it have exceed the hope of those who devise it and become an object of admiration to the world we be responsible to our country and to the glorious cause of self government for the preservation of so great a good the great mass of legislation relate to our internal affair be intend to be leave where the federal convention find it&mdash;in the state government nothing be clear in my view than that we be chiefly indebted for the success of the constitution under which we be now act to the watchful and auxiliary operation of the state authority this be not the reflection of a day but belong to the most deeply rooted conviction of my mind i can not therefore too strongly or too earnestly for my own sense of its importance warn you against all encroachment upon the legitimate sphere of state sovereignty sustain by its healthful and invigorate influence the federal system can never fall in the collection of the revenue the long credit authorize on good import from beyond the cape of good hope be the chief cause of the loss at present sustain if these be shorten to six nine and 12 month and warehouse provide by government sufficient to receive the good offer in deposit for security and for debenture and if the right of the united states to a priority of payment out of the estate of its insolvent debtor be more effectually secure this evil would in a great measure be obviate an authority to construct such house be therefore with the propose alteration of the credit recommend to your attention it be worthy of notice that the law for the collection and security of the revenue arise from impost be chiefly frame when the rate of duty on import good present much less temptation for illicit trade than at present exist there be reason to believe that these law be in some respect quite insufficient for the proper security of the revenue and the protection of the interest of those who be disposed to observe they the injurious and demoralize tendency of a successful system of smuggling be so obvious as not to require comment and can not be too carefully guard against i therefore suggest to congress the propriety of adopt efficient measure to prevent this evil avoid however as much as possible every unnecessary infringement of individual liberty and embarrassment of fair and lawful business on an examination of the record of the treasury i have be forcibly strike with the large amount of public money which appear to be outstanding of the sum thus due from individual to the government a considerable portion be undoubtedly desperate and in many instance have probably be render so by remissness in the agent charge with its collection by proper exertion a great part however may yet be recover and what ever may be the portion respectively belong to these two class it behoove the government to ascertain the real state of the fact this can be do only by the prompt adoption of judicious measure for the collection of such as may be make available it be believe that a very large amount have be lose through the inadequacy of the mean provide for the collection of debt due to the public and that this inadequacy lie chiefly in the want of legal skill habitually and constantly employ in the direction of the agent engage in the service it must i think be admit that the supervisory power over suit bring by the public which be now vest in an accounting officer of the treasury not select with a view to his legal knowledge and encumber as he be with numerous other duty operate unfavorably to the public interest it be important that this branch of the public service should be subject to the supervision of such professional skill as will give it efficiency the expense attendant upon such a modification of the executive department would be justify by the sound principle of economy i would recommend therefore that the duty now assign to the agent of the treasury so far as they relate to the superintendence and management of legal proceeding on the part of the united states be transfer to the attorney general and that this officer be place on the same footing in all respect as the head of the other department receive like compensation and have such subordinate officer provide for his department as may be requisite for the discharge of these additional duty the professional skill of the attorney general employ in direct the conduct of marshal and district attorney would hasten the collection of debt now in suit and hereafter save much to the government it might be far extend to the superintendence of all criminal proceeding for offense against the united states in make this transfer great care should be take however that the power necessary to the treasury department be not impaired one of its great security consist in control over all account until they be audit or report for suit in connection with the foregoing view i would suggest also an inquiry whether the provision of the act of congress authorize the discharge of the person of the debtor to the government from imprisonment may not consistently with the public interest be extend to the release of the debt where the conduct of the debtor be wholly exempt from the imputation of fraud some more liberal policy than that which now prevail in reference to this unfortunate class of citizen be certainly due to they and would prove beneficial to the country the continuance of the liability after the mean to discharge it have be exhaust can only serve to dispirit the debtor or where his resource be but partial the want of power in the government to compromise and release the demand instigate to fraud as the only resource for secure a support to his family he thus sink into a state of apathy and become a useless drone in society or a vicious member of it if not a feeling witness of the rigor and inhumanity of his country all experience prove that oppressive debt be the bane of enterprise and it should be the care of a republic not to exert a grind power over misfortune and poverty since the last session of congress numerous fraud on the treasury have be discover which i think it my duty to bring under the cognizance of the united states court for this district by a criminal prosecution it be my opinion and that of able counsel who be consult that the case come within the penalty of the act of the 17th congress approve 1823 03 03 provide for punishment of fraud commit on the government of the united states either from some defect in the law or in its administration every effort to bring the accuse to trial under its provision prove ineffectual and the government be drive to the necessity of resort to the vague and inadequate provision of the common law it be therefore my duty to call your attention to the law which have be pass for the protection of the treasury if indeed there be no provision by which those who may be unworthily intrust with its guardianship can be punish for the most flagrant violation of duty extend even to the most fraudulent appropriation of the public fund to their own use it be time to remedy so dangerous an omission or if the law have be pervert from its original purpose and criminal deserve to be punish under its provision have be rescue by legal subtlety it ought to be make so plain by amendatory provision as to baffle the art of perversion and accomplish the end of its original enactment in one of the most flagrant cause the court decide that the prosecution be bar by the statute which limit prosecution for fraud to two year in this case all the evidence of the fraud and indeed all knowledge that a fraud have be commit be in possession of the party accuse until after the two year have elapse surely the statute ought not to run in favor of any man while he retain all the evidence of his crime in his own possession and least of all in favor of a public officer who continue to defraud the treasury and conceal the transaction for the brief term of two year i would therefore recommend such an alteration of the law as will give the injure party and the government two year after the disclosure of the fraud or after the accuse be out of office to commence their prosecution in connection with this subject i invite the attention of congress to a general and minute inquiry into the condition of the government with a view to ascertain what office can be dispense with what expense retrench and what improvement may be make in the organization of its various part to secure the proper responsibility of public agent and promote efficiency and justice in all its operation the report of the secretary of war will make you acquaint with the condition of our army fortification arsenal and indian affair the proper discipline of the army the training and equipment of the militia the education bestow at west point and the accumulation of the mean of defense applicable to the naval force will tend to prolong the peace we now enjoy and which every good citizen more especially those who have feel the misery of even a successful warfare must ardently desire to perpetuate the return from the subordinate branch of this service exhibit a regularity and order highly creditable to its character both officer and soldier seem imbue with a proper sense of duty and conform to the restraint of exact discipline with that cheerfulness which become the profession of arm there be need however of further legislation to obviate the inconvenience specify in the report under consideration to some of which it be proper that i should call your particular attention the act of congress of 1821 03 02 to reduce and fix the military establishment remain unexecuted as it regard the command of 1 of the regiment of artillery can not now be deem a guide to the executive in make the proper appointment an explanatory act designate the class of officer out of which the grade be to be filled&mdash;whether from the military list as exist prior to the act of 1821 or from it as it have be fix by that act&mdash;would remove this difficulty it be also important that the law regulate the pay and emolument of officer generally should be more specific than they now be those for example in relation to the paymaster and surgeon general assign to they an annual salary of $ 2.500 but be silent as to allowance which in certain exigency of the service may be deem indispensable to the discharge of their duty this circumstance have be the authority for extend to they various allowance at different time under former administration but no uniform rule have be observe on the subject similar inconvenience exist in other case in which the construction put upon the law by the public accountant may operate unequally produce confusion and expose officer to the odium of claim what be not their due i recommend to your fostering care as one of our safe mean of national defense the military academy this institution have already exercise the happy influence upon the moral and intellectual character of our army and such of the graduate as from various cause may not pursue the profession of arm will be scarcely less useful as citizen their knowledge of the military art will be advantageously employ in the militia service and in a measure secure to that class of troop the advantage which in this respect belong to stand army i would also suggest a review of the pension law for the purpose of extend its benefit to every revolutionary soldier who aid in establish our liberty and who be unable to maintain himself in comfort these relic of the war of independence have strong claim upon their country 's gratitude and bounty the law be defective in not embrace within its provision all those who be during the last war disable from support themselves by manual labor such an amendment would add but little to the amount of pension and be call for by the sympathy of the people as well as by consideration of sound policy it will be perceive that a large addition to the list of pensioner have be occasion by an order of the late administration depart materially from the rule which have previously prevail consider it an act of legislation i suspend its operation as soon as i be inform that it have commence before this period however application under the new regulation have be prefer to the number of 154 of which on march 27 the date of its revocation 87 be admit for the amount there be neither estimate nor appropriation and besides this deficiency the regular allowance accord to the rule which have heretofore govern the department exceed the estimate of its late secretary by about $ 50,000 for which an appropriation be ask your particular attention be request to that part of the report of the secretary of war which relate to the money hold in trust for the seneca tribe of indians it will be perceive that without legislative aid the executive can not obviate the embarrassment occasion by the diminution of the dividend on that fund which originally amount to $ 100,000 and have recently be invest in united states 3 percent stock the condition and ulterior destiny of the indian tribe within the limit of some of our state have become object of much interest and importance it have long be the policy of government to introduce among they the art of civilization in the hope of gradually reclaim they from a wandering life this policy have however be couple with another wholly incompatible with its success profess a desire to civilize and settle they we have at the same time lose no opportunity to purchase their land and thrust they far into the wilderness by this mean they have not only be keep in a wandering state but be lead to look upon we as unjust and indifferent to their fate thus though lavish in its expenditure upon the subject government have constantly defeat its own policy and the indians in general recede far and far to the west have retain their savage habit a portion however of the southern tribe having mingle much with the white and make some progress in the art of civilized life have lately attempt to erect an independent government within the limit of georgia and alabama these state claim to be the only sovereign within their territory extend their law over the indians which induce the latter to call upon the united states for protection under these circumstance the question present be whether the general government have a right to sustain those people in their pretension the constitution declare that no new state shall be form or erect within the jurisdiction of any other state without the consent of its legislature if the general government be not permit to tolerate the erection of a confederate state within the territory of one of the member of this union against her consent much less could it allow a foreign and independent government to establish itself there georgia become a member of the confederacy which eventuate in our federal union as a sovereign state always assert her claim to certain limit which having be originally define in her colonial charter and subsequently recognize in the treaty of peace she have ever since continue to enjoy except as they have be circumscribe by her own voluntary transfer of a portion of her territory to the united states in the article of cession of 1802 alabama be admit into the union on the same footing with the original state with boundary which be prescribe by congress there be no constitutional conventional or legal provision which allow they less power over the indians within their border than be possess by maine or new york would the people of maine permit the penobscot tribe to erect an independent government within their state and unless they do would it not be the duty of the general government to support they in resist such a measure would the people of new york permit each remnant of the six nation within her border to declare itself an independent people under the protection of the united states could the indians establish a separate republic on each of their reservation in ohio and if they be so disposed would it be the duty of this government to protect they in the attempt if the principle involve in the obvious answer to these question be abandon it will follow that the object of this government be reverse and that it have become a part of its duty to aid in destroy the state which it be establish to protect actuate by this view of the subject i inform the indians inhabit part of georgia and alabama that their attempt to establish an independent government would not be countenance by the executive of the united states and advise they to emigrate beyond the mississippi or submit to the law of those state our conduct toward these people be deeply interesting to our national character their present condition contrast with what they once be make a most powerful appeal to our sympathy our ancestor find they the uncontrolled possessor of these vast region by persuasion and force they have be make to retire from river to river and from mountain to mountain until some of the tribe have become extinct and other have leave but remnant to preserve for a while their once terrible name surround by the white with their art of civilization which by destroy the resource of the savage doom he to weakness and decay the fate of the mohegan the narragansett and the delaware be fast overtake the choctaw the cherokee and the creek that this fate surely await they if they remain within the limit of the state do not admit of a doubt humanity and national honor demand that every effort should be make to avert so great a calamity it be too late to inquire whether it be just in the united states to include they and their territory within the bound of new state whose limit they could control that step can not be retrace a state can not be dismember by congress or restrict in the exercise of her constitutional power but the people of those state and of every state actuate by feeling of justice and a regard for our national honor submit to you the interesting question whether something can not be do consistently with the right of the state to preserve this much injure race as a means of effecting this end i suggest for your consideration the propriety of set apart an ample district west of the mississippi and without the limit of any state or territory now form to be guarantee to the indian tribe as long as they shall occupy it each tribe have a distinct control over the portion designate for its use there they may be secure in the enjoyment of government of their own choice subject to no other control from the united states than such as may be necessary to preserve peace on the frontier and between the several tribe there the benevolent may endeavor to teach they the art of civilization and by promote union and harmony among they to raise up an interesting commonwealth destine to perpetuate the race and to attest the humanity and justice of this government this emigration should be voluntary for it would be as cruel as unjust to compel the aborigine to abandon the grave of their father and seek a home in a distant land but they should be distinctly informed that if they remain within the limit of the state they must be subject to their law in return for their obedience as individual they will without doubt be protect in the enjoyment of those possession which they have improve by their industry but it seem to i visionary to suppose that in this state of thing claim can be allow on tract of country on which they have neither dwelt nor make improvement merely because they have see they from the mountain or pass they in the chase submit to the law of the state and receive like other citizen protection in their person and property they will ere long become merge in the mass of our population the accompanying report of the secretary of the navy will make you acquaint with the condition and useful employment of that branch of our service during the present year constitute as it do the good standing security of this country against foreign aggression it claim the especial attention of government in this spirit the measure which since the termination of the last war have be in operation for its gradual enlargement be adopt and it should continue to be cherish as the off spring of our national experience it will be see however that not withstand the great solicitude which have be manifest for the perfect organization of this arm and the liberality of the appropriation which that solicitude have suggest this object have in many important respect not be secure in time of peace we have need of no more ship of war than be requisite to the protection of our commerce those not want for this object must lay in the harbor where without proper covering they rapidly decay and even under the good precaution for their preservation must soon become useless such be already the case with many of our fine vessel which though unfinished will now require immense sum of money to be restore to the condition in which they be when commit to their proper element on this subject there can be but little doubt that our good policy would be to discontinue the building of ship of the first and second class and look rather to the possession of ample material prepare for the emergency of war than to the number of vessel which we can float in a season of peace as the index of our naval power judicious deposit in navy yard of timber and other material fashion under the hand of skillful workman and fit for prompt application to their various purpose would enable we at all time to construct vessel as fast as they can be man and save the heavy expense of repair except to such vessel as must be employ in guard our commerce the proper point for the establishment of these yard be indicate with so much force in the report of the navy board that in recommend it to your attention i deem it unnecessary to do more than express my hearty concurrence in their view the yard in this district be already furnish with most of the machinery necessary for ship building will be competent to the supply of the two select by the board as the good for the concentration of material and from the facility and certainty of communication between they it will be useless to incur at those depot the expense of similar machinery especially that use in prepare the usual metallic and wooden furniture of vessel another improvement would be effect by dispense altogether with the navy board as now constitute and substitute in its stead bureaux similar to those already exist in the war department each member of the board transfer to the head of a separate bureau charge with specific duty would feel in its high degree that wholesome responsibility which can not be divide without a far more than proportionate diminution of its force their valuable service would become still more so when separately appropriate to distinct portion of the great interest of the navy to the prosperity of which each would be impel to devote himself by the strong motive under such an arrangement every branch of this important service would assume a more simple and precise character its efficiency would be increase and scrupulous economy in the expenditure of public money promote i would also recommend that the marine corps be merge in the artillery or infantry as the good mode of cure the many defect in its organization but little exceed in number any of the regiment of infantry that corps have besides its lieutenant colonel commandant five brevet lieutenant colonels who receive the full pay and emolument of their brevet rank without render proportionate service detail for marine service could as well be make from the artillery or infantry there be no peculiar training requisite for it with these improvement and such other as zealous watchfulness and mature consideration may suggest there can be little doubt that under an energetic administration of its affair the navy may soon be make every thing that the nation wish it to be its efficiency in the suppression of piracy in the west india sea and wherever its squadron have be employ in secure the interest of the country will appear from the report of the secretary to which i refer you for other interesting detail among these i would bespeak the attention of congress for the view present in relation to the inequality between the army and navy as to the pay of officer no such inequality should prevail between these brave defender of their country and where it do exist it be submit to congress whether it ought not to be rectify the report of the postmaster general be refer to as exhibit a highly satisfactory administration of that department abuse have be reform increase expedition in the transportation of the mail secure and its revenue much improve in a political point of view this department be chiefly important as afford the mean of diffuse knowledge it be to the body politic what the vein and artery be to the natural&mdash;conveying rapidly and regularly to the remotest part of the system correct information of the operation of the government and bring back to it the wish and feeling of the people through its agency we have secure to ourselves the full enjoyment of the blessing of a free press in this general survey of our affair a subject of high importance present itself in the present organization of the judiciary an uniform operation of the federal government in the different state be certainly desirable and exist as they do in the union on the basis of perfect equality each state have a right to expect that the benefit confer on the citizen of other should be extend to her the judicial system of the united states exist in all its efficiency in only 15 member of the union to three other the circuit court which constitute an important part of that system have be imperfectly extend and to the remain six altogether deny the effect have be to withhold from the inhabitant of the latter the advantage afford by the supreme court to their fellow citizen in other states in the whole extent of the criminal and much of the civil authority of the federal judiciary that this state of thing ought to be remedie if it can be do consistently with the public welfare be not to be doubt neither be it to be disguise that the organization of our judicial system be at once a difficult and delicate task to extend the circuit court equally throughout the different part of the union and at the same time to avoid such a multiplication of member as would encumber the supreme appellate tribunal be the object desire perhaps it might be accomplish by divide the circuit judge into two class and provide that the supreme court should be hold by these class alternately the chief justice always preside if an extension of the circuit court system to those state which do not now enjoy its benefit should be determine upon it would of course be necessary to revise the present arrangement of the circuit and even if that system should not be enlarge such a revision be recommend a provision for take the census of the people of the united states will to insure the completion of that work within a convenient time claim the early attention of congress the great and constant increase of business in the department of state force itself at an early period upon the attention of the executive thirteen year ago it be in mr. madison 's last message to congress make the subject of an earnest recommendation which have be repeat by both of his successor and my comparatively limited experience have satisfy i of its justness it have arise from many cause not the least of which be the large addition that have be make to the family of independent nation and the proportionate extension of our foreign relation the remedy propose be the establishment of a home department&mdash;a measure which do not appear to have meet the view of congress on account of its suppose tendency to increase gradually and imperceptibly the already too strong bias of the federal system toward the exercise of authority not delegate to it i be not therefore dispose to revive the recommendation but be not the less impressed with the importance of so organize that department that its secretary may devote more of his time to our foreign relation clearly satisfied that the public good would be promote by some suitable provision on the subject i respectfully invite your attention to it the charter of the bank of the united states expire in 1836 and its stock holder will most probably apply for a renewal of their privilege in order to avoid the evil result from precipitancy in a measure involve such important principle and such deep pecuniary interest i feel that i can not in justice to the party interested too soon present it to the deliberate consideration of the legislature and the people both the constitutionality and the expediency of the law create this bank be well question by a large portion of our fellow citizen and it must be admit by all that it have fail in the great end of establish an uniform and sound currency under these circumstance if such an institution be deem essential to the fiscal operation of the government i submit to the wisdom of the legislature whether a national one found upon the credit of the government and its revenue might not be devise which would avoid all constitutional difficulty and at the same time secure all the advantage to the government and country that be expect to result from the present bank i can not close this communication without bring to your view the just claim of the representative of commodore decatur his officer and crew arise from the recapture of the frigate philadelphia under the heavy battery of tripoli although sensible as a general rule of the impropriety of executive interference under a government like our where every individual enjoy the right of directly petition congress yet view this case as one of very peculiar character i deem it my duty to recommend it to your favorable consideration besides the justice of this claim as correspond to those which have be since recognize and satisfied it be the fruit of a deed of patriotic and chivalrous daring which infuse life and confidence into our infant navy and contribute as much as any exploit in its history to elevate our national character public gratitude therefore stamp her seal upon it and the meed should not be withhold which may here after operate as a stimulus to our gallant tar i now commend you fellow citizen to the guidance of almighty god with a full reliance on his merciful providence for the maintenance of our free institution and with an earnest supplication that what ever error it may be my lot to commit in discharge the arduous duty which have devolve on i will find a remedy in the harmony and wisdom of your counsel
to the senate of the united states

 gentlemen the accompanying proposition in the form of a treaty have be recently send to i by special messenger from the choctaw nation of indians and since it be receive a protest against it have be forward both evince a desire to cede to the united states all their country east of the mississippi and both be here submit these measure be the voluntary act of the indians themselves the government be not represent in the council which adopt they nor have it any previous intimation that such step be in contemplation the indians convene of their own accord settle and execute the proposition contain in the treaty present to i and agree to be bind by they if within three month they should receive the approbation of the president and senate the other measure be equally their own
 it be certainly desirous on various and very pressing account as will appear from the accompany document that some agreement should be conclude with the indians by which an object so important as their removal beyond the territorial limit of the states may be effect in settle the term of such an agreement i be disposed to exercise the utmost liberality and to concur in any which be consistent with the constitution and not incompatible with the interest of the united states and their duty to the indians i can not however regard the term propose by the choctaws to be in all respect of this character but desirous of conclude an arrangement upon such as be i have draw up the accompany amendment which i propose to offer to the choctaw if they meet the approbation of the senate the condition which they offer be such as in my judgment will be most likely to be acceptable to both party and be liable to the few objection not be tenacious though on the subject i will most cheerfully adopt any modification which on a frank interchange of opinion my constitutional adviser may suggest and which i shall be satisfied be reconcilable with my official duty
 with these view i ask the opinion of the senate upon the following question
 will the senate advise the conclusion of a treaty with the choctaw nation accord to the term which they propose or will the senate advise the conclusion of a treaty with that tribe as modify by the alteration suggest by i if not what further alteration or modification will the senate propose
 i be fully aware that in thus resort to the early practice of the government by ask the previous advice of the senate in the discharge of this portion of my duty i be depart from a long and for many year an unbroken usage in similar case but be satisfied that this resort be consistent with the provision of the constitution that it be strongly recommend in this instance by consideration of expediency and that the reason which have lead to the observance of a different practice though very cogent in negotiation with foreign nation do not apply with equal force to those make with indian tribe i flatter myself that it will not meet the disapprobation of the senate among the reason for a previous expression of the view of the senate the follow be state as most prominent

 1 the indians have request that their proposition should be submit to the senate
 2 the opinion of the senate in relation to the term to be propose will have a salutary effect in a future negotiation if one should be deem proper
 3 the choctaw be one of the most numerous and powerful tribe within our border and as the conclusion of a treaty with they may have a control effect upon other tribe it be important that its term should be well consider those now propose by the choctaws though objectionable it be believe be susceptible of modification which will leave they conformable to the humane and liberal policy which the government desire to observe toward the indian tribe and be at the same time acceptable to they to be possess of the view of the senate on this important and delicate branch of our future negotiation would enable the president to act much more effectively in the exercise of his particular function there be also the good reason to believe that measure in this respect emanating from the united counsel of the treaty make power would be more satisfactory to the american people and to the indians
 it will be see that the pecuniary stipulation be large and in bring this subject to the consideration of the senate i may be allow to remark that the amount of money which may be secure to be pay should in my judgment be view as of minor importance if a fund adequate to the object in view can be obtain from the land which they cede all the purpose of the government should be regard as answer the great desideratum be the removal of the indians and the settlement of the perplexing question involve in their present location a question in which several of the states of this union have the deep interest and which if leave undecide much long may eventuate in serious injury to the indians

to the house of representatives
 gentlemen i have maturely consider the bill propose to authorize a subscription of stock in the maysville washington paris and lexington turnpike road company and now return the same to the house of representatives in which it originate with my objection to its passage
 sincerely friendly to the improvement of our country by mean of road and canal i regret that any difference of opinion in the mode of contribute to it should exist between we and if in state this difference i go beyond what the occasion may be deem to call for i hope to find an apology in the great importance of the subject an unfeigned respect for the high source from which this branch of it have emanate and an anxious wish to be correctly understand by my constituent in the discharge of all my duty diversity of sentiment among public functionary actuate by the same general motive on the character and tendency of particular measure be an incident common to all government and the more to be expect in one which like ours owe its existence to the freedom of opinion and must be uphold by the same influence control as we thus be by a high tribunal before which our respective act will be canvass with the indulgence due to the imperfection of our nature and with that intelligence and unbiased judgment which be the true corrective of error all that our responsibility demand be that the public good should be the measure of our view dictate alike their frank expression and honest maintenance
 in the message which be present to congress at the opening of its present session i endeavor to exhibit briefly my view upon the important and highly interesting subject to which our attention be now to be direct i be desirous of present to the representative of the several states in congress assemble the inquiry whether some mode could not be devise which would reconcile the diversity of opinion concern the power of this government over the subject of internal improvement and the manner in which these power if confer by the constitution ought to be exercise the act which i be call upon to consider have therefore be pass with a knowledge of my view on this question as these be express in the message refer to in that document the follow suggestion will be find
 after the extinction of the public debt it be not probable that any adjustment of the tariff upon principle satisfactory to the people of the union will until a remote period if ever leave the government without a considerable surplus in the treasury beyond what may be require for its current service as then the period approach when the application of the revenue to the payment of debt will cease the disposition of the surplus will present a subject for the serious deliberation of congress and it may be fortunate for the country that it be yet to be decide consider in connection with the difficulty which have heretofore attend appropriation for purpose of internal improvement and with those which this experience tell we will certainly arise whenever power over such subject may be exercise by the general government it be hope that it may lead to the adoption of some plan which will reconcile the diversified interest of the states and strengthen the bond which unite they every member of the union in peace and in war will be benefit by the improvement of inland navigation and the construction of highway in the several states let we then endeavor to attain this benefit in a mode which will be satisfactory to all that hitherto adopt have by many of our fellow citizen be deprecate as an infraction of the constitution while by other it have be view as inexpedient all feel that it have be employ at the expense of harmony in the legislative council
 and advert to the constitutional power of congress to make what i consider a proper disposition of the surplus revenue i subjoin the follow remark
 to avoid these evil it appear to i that the most safe just and federal disposition which could be make of the surplus revenue would be its apportionment among the several states accord to their ratio of representation and should this measure not be find warrant by the constitution that it would be expedient to propose to the states an amendment authorize it
 the constitutional power of the federal government to construct or promote work of internal improvement present itself in two point of view the first as bear upon the sovereignty of the states within whose limit their execution be contemplate if jurisdiction of the territory which they may occupy be claim as necessary to their preservation and use the second as assert the simple right to appropriate money from the national treasury in aid of such work when undertake by state authority surrender the claim of jurisdiction in the first view the question of power be an open one and can be decide without the embarrassment attend the other arise from the practice of the government although frequently and strenuously attempt the power to this extent have never be exercise by the government in a single instance it do not in my opinion possess it and no bill therefore which admit it can receive my official sanction
 but in the other view of the power the question be differently situate the ground take at an early period of the government be that whenever money have be raise by the general authority and be to be apply to a particular measure a question arise whether the particular measure be within the enumerate authority vest in congress if it be the money requisite for it may be apply to it if not no such application can be make the document in which this principle be first advanced be of deservedly high authority and should be hold in grateful remembrance for its immediate agency in rescue the country from much exist abuse and for its conservative effect upon some of the most valuable principle of the constitution the symmetry and purity of the government would doubtless have be well preserve if this restriction of the power of appropriation could have be maintain without weaken its ability to fulfill the general object of its institution an effect so likely to attend its admission notwithstanding its apparent fitness that every subsequent administration of the government embrace a period of thirty out of the forty two year of its existence have adopt a more enlarged construction of the power it be not my purpose to detain you by a minute recital of the act which sustain this assertion but it be proper that i should notice some of the most prominent in order that the reflection which they suggest to my mind may be well understand
 in the administration of mr. jefferson we have two example of the exercise of the right of appropriation which in the consideration that lead to their adoption and in their effect upon the public mind have have a great agency in mark the character of the power than any subsequent event i allude to the payment of $ 15,000,000 for the purchase of louisiana and to the original appropriation for the construction of the cumberland road the latter act derive much weight from the acquiescence and approbation of three of the most powerful of the original member of the confederacy express through their respective legislature although the circumstance of the latter case may be such as to deprive so much of it as relate to the actual construction of the road of the force of an obligatory exposition of the constitution it must nevertheless be admit that so far as the mere appropriation of money be concern they present the principle in its most impose aspect no less than twenty three different law have be pass through all the form of the constitution appropriate upward of $ 2,500,000 out of the national treasury in support of that improvement with the approbation of every president of the united states include my predecessor since its commencement
 independently of the sanction give to appropriation for the cumberland and other road and object under this power the administration of mr. madison be characterize by an act which furnish the strong evidence of his opinion of its extent a bill be pass through both houses of congress and present for his approval set apart and pledge certain fund for construct road and canal and improve the navigation of water course in order to facilitate promote and give security to internal commerce among the several states and to render more easy and less expensive the mean and provision for the common defense regard the bill as assert a power in the federal government to construct road and canal within the limit of the states in which they be make he object to its passage on the ground of its unconstitutionally declare that the assent of the respective states in the mode provide by the bill could not confer the power in question that the only case in which the consent and cession of particular states can extend the power of congress be those specify and provide for in the constitution and superadde to these avowal his opinion that a restriction of the power to provide for the common defense and general welfare to case which be to be provide for by the expenditure of money would still leave within the legislative power of congress all the great and most important measure of government money be the ordinary and necessary mean of carry they into execution i have not be able to consider these declaration in any other point of view than as a concession that the right of appropriation be not limit by the power to carry into effect the measure for which the money be ask as be formerly contend
 the view of mr. monroe upon this subject be not leave to inference during his administration a bill be pass through both houses of congress confer the jurisdiction and prescribe the mode by which the federal government should exercise it in the case of the cumberland road he return it with objection to its passage and in assign they take occasion to say that in the early stage of the government he have incline to the construction that it have no right to expend money except in the performance of act authorize by the other specific grant of power accord to a strict construction of they but that on further reflection and observation his mind have undergo a change that his opinion then be that congress have an unlimited power to raise money and that in its appropriation they have a discretionary power restrict only by the duty to appropriate it to purpose of common defense and of general not local national not state benefit and this be avow to be the govern principle through the residue of his administration the view of the last administration be of such recent date as to render a particular reference to they unnecessary it be well know that the appropriating power to the utmost extent which have be claim for it in relation to internal improvement be fully recognize and exercise by it
 this brief reference to know fact will be sufficient to show the difficulty if not impracticability of bring back the operation of the government to the construction of the constitution set up in 1798 assume that to be its true reading in relation to the power under consideration thus give an admonitory proof of the force of implication and the necessity of guard the constitution with sleepless vigilance against the authority of precedent which have not the sanction of its most plainly define power for although it be the duty of all to look to that sacred instrument instead of the statute book to repudiate at all time encroachment upon its spirit which be too apt to be effect by the conjuncture of peculiar and facilitate circumstance it be not less true that the public good and the nature of our political institution require that individual difference should yield to a well settle acquiescence of the people and confederate authority in particular construction of the constitution on doubtful point not to concede this much to the spirit of our institution would impair their stability and defeat the object of the constitution itself
 the bill before i do not call for a more definite opinion upon the particular circumstance which will warrant appropriation of money by congress to aid work of internal improvement for although the extension of the power to apply money beyond that of carry into effect the object for which it be appropriate have as we have see be long claim and exercise by the federal government yet such grant have always be professedly under the control of the general principle that the work which might be thus aid should be of a general not local national not state character a disregard of this distinction would of necessity lead to the subversion of the federal system that even this be an unsafe one arbitrary in its nature and liable consequently to great abuse be too obvious to require the confirmation of experience it be however sufficiently definite and imperative to my mind to forbid my approbation of any bill have the character of the one under consideration i have give to its provision all the reflection demand by a just regard for the interest of those of our fellow citizen who have desire its passage and by the respect which be due to a coordinate branch of the government but i be not able to view it in any other light than as a measure of purely local character or if it can be consider national that no further distinction between the appropriate duty of the general and state government need be attempt for there can be no local interest that may not with equal propriety be denominate national it have no connection with any establish system of improvement be exclusively within the limit of a state start at a point on the ohio river and run out 60 mile to an interior town and even as far as the state be interested confer partial instead of general advantage
 consider the magnitude and importance of the power and the embarrassment to which from the very nature of the thing its exercise must necessarily be subject the real friend of internal improvement ought not to be willing to confide it to accident and chance what be properly national in its character or otherwise be an inquiry which be often extremely difficult of solution the appropriation of one year for an object which be consider national may be render nugatory by the refusal of a succeed congress to continue the work on the ground that it be local no aid can be derive from the intervention of corporation the question regard the character of the work not that of those by whom it be to be accomplish notwithstanding the union of the government with the corporation by whose immediate agency any work of internal improvement be carry on the inquiry will still remain be it national and conducive to the benefit of the whole or local and operate only to the advantage of a portion of the union
 but although i might not feel it to be my official duty to interpose the executive veto to the passage of a bill appropriate money for the construction of such work as be authorize by the states and be national in their character i do not wish to be understand as express an opinion that it be expedient at this time for the general government to embark in a system of this kind and anxious that my constituent should be possess of my view on this as well as on all other subject which they have commit to my discretion i shall state they frankly and briefly besides many minor consideration there be two prominent view of the subject which have make a deep impression upon my mind which i think be well entitled to your serious attention and will i hope be maturely weigh by the people
 from the official communication submit to you it appear that if no adverse and unforeseen contingency happen in our foreign relation and no unusual diversion be make of the fund set apart for the payment of the national debt we may look with confidence to its entire extinguishment in the short period of four year the extent to which this pleasing anticipation be dependent upon the policy which may be pursue in relation to measure of the character of the one now under consideration must be obvious to all and equally so that the event of the present session be well calculate to awaken public solicitude upon the subject by the statement from the treasury department and those from the clerk of the senate and house of representatives herewith submit it appear that the bill which have pass into law and those which in all probability will pass before the adjournment of congress anticipate appropriation which with the ordinary expenditure for the support of government will exceed considerably the amount in the treasury for the year 1830 thus whilst we be diminish the revenue by a reduction of the duty on tea coffee and cocoa the appropriation for internal improvement be increase beyond the available mean of the treasury and if to this calculation be add the amount contain in bill which be pende before the two houses it may be safely affirm that $ 10,000,000 would not make up the excess over the treasury receipt unless the payment of the national debt be postpone and the mean now pledge to that object apply to those enumerate in these bill without a well regulate system of internal improvement this exhausting mode of appropriation be not likely to be avoid and the plain consequence must be either a continuance of the national debt or a resort to additional taxis
 although many of the states with a laudable zeal and under the influence of an enlightened policy be successfully apply their separate effort to work of this character the desire to enlist the aid of the general government in the construction of such as from their nature ought to devolve upon it and to which the mean of the individual state be inadequate be both rational and patriotic and if that desire be not gratify now it do not follow that it never will be the general intelligence and public spirit of the american people furnish a sure guaranty that at the proper time this policy will be make to prevail under circumstance more auspicious to its successful prosecution than those which now exist but great as this object undoubtedly be it be not the only one which demand the foster care of the government the preservation and success of the republican principle rest with we to elevate its character and extend its influence rank among our most important duty and the good mean to accomplish this desirable end be those which will rivet the attachment of our citizen to the government of their choice by the comparative lightness of their public burthen and by the attraction which the superior success of its operation will present to the admiration and respect of the world through the favor of an overruling and indulgent providence our country be bless with general prosperity and our citizen exempt from the pressure of taxation which other less favor portion of the human family be oblige to bear yet it be true that many of the taxis collect from our citizen through the medium of impost have for a considerable period be onerous in many particular these taxis have bear severely upon the labor and less prosperous class of the community be impose on the necessary of life and this too in case where the burthen be not relieve by the consciousness that it would ultimately contribute to make we independent of foreign nation for article of prime necessity by the encouragement of their growth and manufacture at home they have be cheerfully bear because they be think to be necessary to the support of government and the payment of the debt unavoidably incur in the acquisition and maintenance of our national right and liberty but have we a right to calculate on the same cheerful acquiescence when it be know that the necessity for their continuance would cease be it not for irregular improvident and unequal appropriation of the public fund will not the people demand as they have a right to do such a prudent system of expenditure as will pay the debt of the union and authorize the reduction of every tax to as low a point as the wise observance of the necessity to protect that portion of our manufacture and labor whose prosperity be essential to our national safety and independence will allow when the national debt be pay the duty upon those article which we do not raise may be repeal with safety and still leave i trust without oppression to any section of the country an accumulate surplus fund which may be beneficially apply to some well digest system of improvement
 under this view the question as to the manner in which the federal government can or ought to embark in the construction of road and canal and the extent to which it may impose burthen on the people for these purpose may be present on its own merit free of all disguise and of every embarrassment except such as may arise from the constitution itself assume these suggestion to be correct will not our constituent require the observance of a course by which they can be effect ought they not to require it with the good disposition to aid as far as i can conscientiously in furtherance of work of internal improvement my opinion be that the sound view of national policy at this time point to such a course besides the avoidance of an evil influence upon the local concern of the country how solid be the advantage which the government will reap from it in the elevation of its character how gratify the effect of present to the world the sublime spectacle of a republic of more than 12,000,000 happy people in the fifty fourth year of her existence after having pass through two protract war the one for the acquisition and the other for the maintenance of liberty free from debt and with all her immense resource unfettere what a salutary influence would not such an exhibition exercise upon the cause of liberal principle and free government throughout the world would we not ourselves find in its effect an additional guaranty that our political institution will be transmit to the most remote posterity without decay a course of policy destine to witness event like these can not be benefit by a legislation which tolerate a scramble for appropriation that have no relation to any general system of improvement and whose good effect must of necessity be very limited in the good view of these appropriation the abuse to which they lead far exceed the good which they be capable of promote they may be resort to as artful expedient to shift upon the government the loss of unsuccessful private speculation and thus by minister to personal ambition and self aggrandizement tend to sap the foundation of public virtue and taint the administration of the government with a demoralizing influence
 in the other view of the subject and the only remain one which it be my intention to present at this time be involve the expediency of embark in a system of internal improvement without a previous amendment of the constitution explain and define the precise power of the federal government over it assume the right to appropriate money to aid in the construction of national work to be warrant by the contemporaneous and continued exposition of the constitution its insufficiency for the successful prosecution of they must be admit by all candid mind if we look to usage to define the extent of the right that will be find so variant and embrace so much that have be overrule as to involve the whole subject in great uncertainty and to render the execution of our respective duty in relation to it replete with difficulty and embarrassment it be in regard to such work and the acquisition of additional territory that the practice obtain its first footing in most if not all other dispute question of appropriation the construction of the constitution may be regard as unsettled if the right to apply money in the enumerate case be place on the ground of usage
 this subject have be one of much and i may add painful reflection to i it have bearing that be well calculate to exert a powerful influence upon our hitherto prosperous system of government and which on some account may even excite despondency in the breast of an american citizen i will not detain you with profession of zeal in the cause of internal improvement if to be their friend be a virtue which deserve commendation our country be bless with an abundance of it for i do not suppose there be an intelligent citizen who do not wish to see they flourish but though all be their friend but few i trust be unmindful of the mean by which they should be promote none certainly be so degenerate as to desire their success at the cost of that sacred instrument with the preservation of which be indissolubly bind our country&#39; hope if different impression be entertain in any quarter if it be expect that the people of this country reckless of their constitutional obligation will prefer their local interest to the principle of the union such expectation will in the end be disappoint or if it be not so then indeed have the world but little to hope from the example of free government when an honest observance of constitutional compact can not be obtain from community like our it need not be anticipate elsewhere and the cause in which there have be so much martyrdom and from which so much be expect by the friend of liberty may be abandon and the degrading truth that man be unfit for self government admit and this will be the case if expediency be make a rule of construction in interpret the constitution power in no government could desire a well shield for the insidious advance which it be ever ready to make upon the check that be design to restrain its action
 but i do not entertain such gloomy apprehension if it be the wish of the people that the construction of road and canal should be conduct by the federal government it be not only highly expedient but indispensably necessary that a previous amendment of the constitution delegate the necessary power and defining and restrict its exercise with reference to the sovereignty of the states should be make without it nothing extensively useful can be effect the right to exercise as much jurisdiction as be necessary to preserve the work and to raise fund by the collection of toll to keep they in repair can not be dispense with the cumberland road should be an instructive admonition of the consequence of act without this right year after year contest be witness grow out of effort to obtain the necessary appropriation for complete and repair this useful work whilst one congress may claim and exercise the power a succeed one may deny it and this fluctuation of opinion must be unavoidably fatal to any scheme which from its extent would promote the interest and elevate the character of the country the experience of the past have show that the opinion of congress be subject to such fluctuation
 if it be the desire of the people that the agency of the federal government should be confine to the appropriation of money in aid of such undertaking in virtue of state authority then the occasion the manner and the extent of the appropriation should be make the subject of constitutional regulation this be the more necessary in order that they may be equitable among the several states promote harmony between different section of the union and their representative preserve other part of the constitution from be undermine by the exercise of doubtful power or the too great extension of those which be not so and protect the whole subject against the deleterious influence of combination to carry by concert measure which consider by themselves might meet but little countenance
 that a constitutional adjustment of this power upon equitable principle be in the high degree desirable can scarcely be doubt nor can it fail to be promote by every sincere friend to the success of our political institution in no government be appeal to the source of power in case of real doubt more suitable than in ours no good motive can be assign for the exercise of power by the constituted authority while those for whose benefit it be to be exercise have not confer it and may not be willing to confer it it would seem to i that an honest application of the concede power of the general government to the advancement of the common weal present a sufficient scope to satisfy a reasonable ambition the difficulty and suppose impracticability of obtain an amendment of the constitution in this respect be i firmly believe in a great degree unfounded the time have never yet be when the patriotism and intelligence of the american people be not fully equal to the great exigency and it never will when the subject call forth their interposition be plainly present to they to do so with the question involve in this bill and to urge they to an early zealous and full consideration of their deep importance be in my estimation among the high of our duty
 a suppose connection between appropriation for internal improvement and the system of protect duty grow out of the anxiety of those more immediately interested in their success have give rise to suggestion which it be proper i should notice on this occasion my opinion on these subject have never be conceal from those who have a right to know they those which i have entertain on the latter have frequently place i in opposition to individual as well as community whose claim upon my friendship and gratitude be of the strong character but i trust there have be nothing in my public life which have expose i to the suspicion of be think capable of sacrifice my view of duty to private consideration however strong they may have be or deep the regret which they be capable of exciting
 as long as the encouragement of domestic manufacture be direct to national end it shall receive from i a temperate but steady support there be no necessary connection between it and the system of appropriation on the contrary it appear to i that the supposition of their dependence upon each other be calculate to excite the prejudice of the public against both the former be sustain on the ground of its consistency with the letter and spirit of the constitution of its origin be trace to the assent of all the party to the original compact and of its have the support and approbation of a majority of the people on which account it be at least entitle to a fair experiment the suggestion to which i have allude refer to a force continuance of the national debt by mean of large appropriation as a substitute for the security which the system derive from the principle on which it have hitherto be sustain such a course would certainly indicate either an unreasonable distrust of the people or a consciousness that the system do not possess sufficient soundness for its support if leave to their voluntary choice and its own merit those who suppose that any policy thus rounded can be long uphold in this country have look upon its history with eye very different from mine this policy like every other must abide the will of the people who will not be likely to allow any device however specious to conceal its character and tendency
 in present these opinion i have speak with the freedom and candor which i think the occasion for their expression call for and now respectfully return the bill which have be under consideration for your further deliberation and judgment

of our beloved country at this period justly inspire the beneficent author of all good have grant to we during the present year health peace and plenty and numerous cause for joy in the wonderful

the union interest whose collision serve only in the end to foster the spirit of conciliation and patriotism so essential to the preservation of that union which i most devoutly hope be destine to prove imperishable in the midst of these blessing we have recently witness change in the condition of other nation which may in their consequence call for the utmost vigilance wisdom and unanimity in our council and the exercise of all the moderation and patriotism of our people the important modification of their government effect with so much courage and wisdom by the people of france afford a happy presage of their future course and have naturally elicit from the kindre feeling of this nation that spontaneous and universal burst of applause in which you have participate in congratulate you my fellow citizen upon an event so auspicious to the dear interest of mankind i do no more than respond to the voice of my country without transcend in the slight degree that salutary maxim of the illustrious washington which enjoin an abstinence from all interference with the internal affair of other nation from a people exercise in the most unlimited degree the right of self government and enjoy as derive from this proud characteristic under the favor of heaven much of the happiness with which they be bless a people who can point in triumph to their free institution and challenge comparison with the fruit they bear as well as with the moderation intelligence and energy with which they be administer from such a people the deep sympathy be to be expect in a struggle for the

man whom we so sincerely love and justly admire have give to the world of the high character of the present king of the french and which if sustain to the end will secure to he the proud appellation of patriot king it be not in his success but in that of the great principle which have bear he to the throne the paramount authority of the public will that the american people rejoice i be happy to inform you that the anticipation which be indulge at the date of my last communication on the subject of our foreign affair have be fully realize in several important particular an arrangement have be effect with great britain in relation to the trade between the united states and her west india and north american colony which have settle a question that have for year afford matter for contention and almost uninterrupted discussion and have be the subject of no less than six negotiation in a manner which promise result highly favorable to the party the abstract right of great britain to monopolize the trade with her colony or to exclude we from a participation therein have never be deny by the united states but we have contend and with reason that if at any time great britain may desire the production of this country as necessary to her colony they must be receive upon principle of just reciprocity and far that it be make an invidious and unfriendly distinction to open her colonial port to the vessel of other nation and close they against those of the united states antecedently to 1794 a portion of our production be admit into the colonial island of great britain by particular concession limit to the term of one year but renew from year to year in the transportation of these production however our vessel be not allow to engage this be a privilege reserve to british shipping by which alone our produce could be take to the island and theirs bring to we in return from newfoundland and her continental possession all our production as well as our vessel be exclude with occasional relaxation by which in season of distress the former be admit in british bottom by the treaty of 1794 she offer to concede to we for a limited time the right of carry to her west india possession in our vessel not exceed 70 ton burthen and upon the same term as british vessel any production of the united states which british vessel might import therefrom but this privilege be couple with condition which be suppose to have lead to its rejection by the senate that be that american vessel should land their return cargoe in the united states only and moreover that they should during the continuance of the privilege be preclude from carry molasse sugar coffee cocoa or cotton either from those island or from the united states to any other part of the world great britain readily consent to expunge this article from the treaty and subsequent attempt to arrange the term of the trade either by treaty stipulation or concerted legislation have fail it have be successively suspend and allow accord to the vary legislation of the party the follow be the prominent point which have in later year separate the two government besides a restriction whereby all importation into her colony in american vessel be confine to our own product carry hence a restriction to which it do not appear that we have ever object a lead object on the part of great britain have be to prevent we from become the carrier of british west india commodity to any other country than our own on the part of the united states it have be contend first that the subject should be regulate by treaty stipulation in preference to separate legislation second that our production when import into the colony in question should not be subject to high duty than the production of the mother country or of her other colonial possession and third that our vessel should be allow to participate in the circuitous trade between the united states and different part of the british dominion the first point after having be for a long time strenuously insist upon by great britain be give up by the act of parliament of july 1825 all vessel suffer to trade with the colony be permit to clear from thence with any article which british vessel might export and proceed to any part of the world great britain and her dependency alone except on our part each of the above point have in succession be explicitly abandon in negotiation precede that of which the result be now announce this arrangement secure to the united states every advantage ask by they and which the state of the negotiation allow we to insist upon the trade will be place upon a foot decidedly more favorable to this country than any on which it ever stand and our commerce and navigation will enjoy in the colonial port of great britain every privilege allow to other nation that the prosperity of the country so far as it depend on this trade will be greatly promote by the new arrangement there can be no doubt independently of the more obvious advantage of an open and direct intercourse its establishment will be attend with other consequence of a high value that which have be carry on since the mutual interdict under all the expense and inconvenience unavoidably incident to it would have be insupportably onerous have it not be in a great degree lighten by concert evasion in the mode of make the transshipment at what be call the neutral port these indirection be inconsistent with the dignity of nation that have so many motive not only to cherish feeling of mutual friendship but to maintain such relation as will stimulate their respective citizen and subject to effort of direct open and honorable competition only and preserve they from the influence of seductive and vitiate circumstance when your preliminary interposition be ask at the close of the last session a copy of the instruction under which mr. mclane have act together with the communication which have at that time pass between he and the british government be lay before you although there have not be any thing in the act of the two government which require secrecy it be think most proper in the then state of the negotiation to make that communication a confidential one so soon however as the evidence of execution on the part of great britain be receive the whole matter shall be lay before you when it will be see that the apprehension which appear to have suggest one of the provision of the act pass at your last session that the restoration of the trade in question might be connect with other subject and be seek to be obtain at the sacrifice of the public interest in other particular be wholly unfounded and that the change which have take place in the view of the british government have be induce by consideration as honorable to both party as i trust the result will prove beneficial this desirable result be it will be see greatly promote by the liberal and confide provision of the act of congress of the last session by which our port be upon the reception and annunciation by the president of the require assurance on the part of great britain forthwith open to her vessel before the arrangement could be carry into effect on her part pursue in this act of prospective legislation a similar course to that adopt by great britain in abolishing by her act of parliament in 1825 a restriction then exist and permit our vessel to clear from the colony on their return voyage for any foreign country whatever before british vessel have be relieve from the restriction impose by our law of return directly from the united states to the colony a restriction which she require and expect that we should abolish upon each occasion a limited and temporary advantage have be give to the opposite party but an advantage of no importance in comparison with the restoration of mutual confidence and good feeling and the ultimate establishment of the trade upon fair principle it give i unfeigned pleasure to assure you that this negotiation have be throughout characterize by the most frank and friendly spirit on the part of great britain and conclude in a manner strongly indicative of a sincere desire to cultivate the good relation with the united states to reciprocate this disposition to the full extent of my ability be a duty which i shall deem it a privilege to discharge although the result be itself the good commentary on the service render to his country by our minister at the court of st. james it would be do violence to my feeling be i to dismiss the subject without express the very high sense i entertain of the talent and exertion which have be display by he on the occasion the injury to the commerce of the united states result from the exclusion of our vessel from the black sea and the previous footing of mere sufferance upon which even the limited trade enjoy by we with turkey have hitherto be place have for a long time be a source of much solicitude to this government and several endeavor have be make to obtain a well state of thing sensible of the importance of the object i feel it my duty to leave no proper mean unemployed to acquire for our flag the same privilege that be enjoy by the principal power of europe commissioner be consequently appoint to open a negotiation with the sublime porte not long after the member of the commission who go directly from the united states have sail the account of the treaty of adrianople by which one of the object in view be suppose to be secure reach this country the black sea be understand to be open to we under the supposition that this be the case the additional facility to be derive from the establishment of commercial regulation with the porte be deem of sufficient importance to require a prosecution of the negotiation as originally contemplate it be therefore persevered in and result in a treaty which will be forthwith lay before the senate by its provision a free passage be secure without limitation of time to the vessel of the united states to and from the black sea include the navigation thereof and our trade with turkey be place on the footing of the most favored nation the latter be an arrangement wholly independent of the treaty of adrianople and the former derive much value not only from the increase security which under any circumstance it would give to the right in question but from the fact ascertain in the course of the negotiation that by the construction put upon that treaty by turkey the article relate to the passage of the bosphorus be confine to nation have treaty with the porte the most friendly feeling appear to be entertain by the sultan and an enlightened disposition be evince by he to foster the intercourse between the two country by the most liberal arrangement this disposition it will be our duty and interest to cherish our relation with russia be of the most stable character respect for that empire and confidence in its friendship toward the united states have be so long entertain on our part and so carefully cherish by the present emperor and his illustrious predecessor as to have become incorporate with the public sentiment of the united states no mean will be leave unemployed on my part to promote these salutary feeling and those improvement of which the commercial intercourse between the two country be susceptible and which have derive increase importance from our treaty with the sublime porte i sincerely regret to inform you that our minister lately commission to that court on whose distinguished talent and great experience in public affair i place great reliance have be compel by extreme indisposition to exercise a privilege which in consideration of the extent to which his constitution have be impair in the public service be commit to his discretion of leave temporarily his post for the advantage of a more genial climate if as it be to be hope the improvement of his health should be such as to justify he in do so he will repair to st. petersburg and resume the discharge of his official duty i have receive the most satisfactory assurance that in the mean time the public interest in that quarter will be preserve from prejudice by the intercourse which he will continue through the secretary of legation with the russian cabinet you be apprise although the fact have not yet be officially announce to the house of representatives that a treaty be in the month of march last conclude between the united states and denmark by which $ 650,000 be secure to our citizen as an indemnity for spoliation upon their commerce in the year 1808 1809 1810 and 1811 this treaty be sanction by the senate at the close of its last session and it now become the duty of congress to pass the necessary law for the organization of the board of commissioner to distribute the indemnity among the claimant it be an agreeable circumstance in this adjustment that the term be in conformity with the previously ascertain view of the claimant themselves thus remove all pretense for a future agitation of the subject in any form the negotiation in regard to such point in our foreign relation as remain to be adjust have be actively prosecute during the recess material advance have be make which be of a character to promise favorable result our country by the blessing of god be not in a situation to invite aggression and it will be our fault if she ever become so sincerely desirous to cultivate the most liberal and friendly relation with all ever ready to fulfill our engagement with scrupulous fidelity limit our demand upon other to mere justice hold ourselves ever ready to do unto they as we would wish to be do by and avoid even the appearance of undue partiality to any nation it appear to i impossible that a simple and sincere application of our principle to our foreign relation can fail to place they ultimately upon the footing on which it be our wish they should rest of the point refer to the most prominent be our claim upon france for spoliation upon our commerce similar claim upon spain together with embarrassment in the commercial intercourse between the two country which ought to be remove the conclusion of the treaty of commerce and navigation with mexico which have be so long in suspense as well as the final settlement of limit between ourselves and that republic and finally the arbitrament of the question between the united states and great britain in regard to the northeastern boundary the negotiation with france have be conduct by our minister with zeal and ability and in all respect to my entire satisfaction although the prospect of a favorable termination be occasionally dim by counter pretension to which the united states could not assent he yet have strong hope of be able to arrive at a satisfactory settlement with the late government the negotiation have be renew with the present authority and sensible of the general and lively confidence of our citizen in the justice and magnanimity of regenerated france i regret the more not to have it in my power yet to announce the result so confidently anticipate no ground however inconsistent with this expectation have yet be take and i do not allow myself to doubt that justice will soon be do we the amount of the claim the length of time they have remain unsatisfied and their incontrovertible justice make an earnest prosecution of they by this government an urgent duty the illegality of the seizure and confiscation out of which they have arise be not dispute and what ever distinction may have heretofore be set up in regard to the liability of the exist government it be quite clear that such consideration can not now be interpose the commercial intercourse between the two country be susceptible of highly advantageous improvement but the sense of this injury have have and must continue to have a very unfavorable influence upon they from its satisfactory adjustment not only a firm and cordial friendship but a progressive development of all their relation may be expect it be therefore my earnest hope that this old and vexatious subject of difference may be speedily remove i feel that my confidence in our appeal to the motive which should govern a just and magnanimous nation be alike warrant by the character of the french people and by the high voucher we possess for the enlarge view and pure integrity of the monarch who now preside over their council and nothing shall be want on my part to meet any manifestation of the spirit we anticipate in one of correspond frankness and liberality the subject of difference with spain have be bring to the view of that government by our minister there with much force and propriety and the strong assurance have be receive of their early and favorable consideration i be particularly gratified in be able to state that a decidedly favorable and as i hope lasting change have be effect in our relation with the neighboring republic of mexico the unfortunate and unfounded suspicion in regard to our disposition which it become my painful duty to advert to on a former occasion have be i believe entirely remove and the government of mexico have be make to understand the real character of the wish and view of this in regard to that country the consequence be the establishment of friendship and mutual confidence such be the assurance i have receive and i see no cause to doubt their sincerity i have reason to expect the conclusion of a commercial treaty with mexico in season for communication on the present occasion circumstance which be not explain but which i be persuade be not the result of an indisposition on her part to enter into it have produce the delay there be reason to fear in the course of the last summer that the harmony of our relation might be disturb by the act of certain claimant under mexican grant of territory which have hitherto be under our jurisdiction the cooperation of the representative of mexico near this government be ask on the occasion and be readily afford instruction and advice have be give to the governor of arkansas and the officer in command in the adjoining mexican state by which it be hope the quiet of that frontier will be preserve until a final settlement of the dividing line shall have remove all ground of controversy the exchange of ratification of the treaty conclude last year with austria have not yet take place the delay have be occasion by the non arrival of the ratification of that government within the time prescribe by the treaty renew authority have be ask for by the representative of austria and in the mean time the rapidly increase trade and navigation between the two country have be place upon the most liberal footing of our navigation act several alleged depredation have be recently commit on our commerce by the national vessel of portugal they have be make the subject of immediate remonstrance and reclamation i be not yet possess of sufficient information to express a definitive opinion of their character but expect soon to receive it no proper mean shall be omit to obtain for our citizen all the redress to which they may appear to be entitle almost at the moment of the adjournment of your last session two bill the one entitle an act for make appropriation for build light house light boat beacon and monument place buoy and for improve harbor and direct survey and the other an act to authorize a subscription for stock in the louisville and portland canal company"—were submit for my approval it be not possible within the time allow for i before the close of the session to give to these bill the consideration which be due to their character and importance and i be compel to retain they for that purpose i now avail myself of this early opportunity to return they to the houses in which they respectively originate with the reason which after mature deliberation compel i to withhold my approval the practice of defray out of the treasury of the united states the expense incur by the establishment and support of light house beacon buoy and public pier within the bay inlet harbor and port of the united states to render the navigation thereof safe and easy be coeval with the adoption of the constitution and have be continue without interruption or dispute as our foreign commerce increase and be extend into the interior of the country by the establishment of port of entry and delivery upon our navigable river the sphere of those expenditure receive a corresponding enlargement light house beacon buoy public pier and the removal of sand bar sawyer and other partial or temporary impediment in the navigable river and harbor which be embrace in the revenue district from time to time establish by law be authorize upon the same principle and the expense defray in the same manner that these expense have at time be extravagant and disproportionate be very probable the circumstance under which they be incur be well calculate to lead to such a result unless their application be subject to the close scrutiny the local advantage arise from the disbursement of public money too frequently it be to be fear invite appropriation for object of this character that be neither necessary nor useful the number of light house keeper be already very large and the bill before i propose to add to it 51 more of various description from representation upon the subject which be understand to be entitle to respect i be induce to believe that there have not only be great improvidence in the past expenditure of the government upon these object but that the security of navigation have in some instance be diminish by the multiplication of light house and consequent change of light upon the coast it be in this as in other respect our duty to avoid all unnecessary expense as well as every increase of patronage not call for by the public service but in the discharge of that duty in this particular it must not be forget that in relation to our foreign commerce the burden and benefit of protect and accommodate it necessarily go together and must do so as long as the public revenue be draw from the people through the custom house it be indisputable that whatever give facility and security to navigation cheapen import and all who consume they be alike interested in what ever produce this effect if they consume they ought as they now do to pay otherwise they do not pay the consumer in the most inland state derive the same advantage from every necessary and prudent expenditure for the facility and security of our foreign commerce and navigation that he do who reside in a maritime state local expenditure have not of themselves a corresponding operation from a bill make direct appropriation for such object i should not have withhold my assent the one now return do so in several particular but it also contain appropriation for survey of local character which i can not approve it give i satisfaction to find that no serious inconvenience have arise from withhold my approval from this bill nor will it i trust be cause of regret that an opportunity will be thereby afford for congress to review its provision under circumstance well calculate for full investigation than those under which it be pass in speaking of direct appropriation i mean not to include a practice which have obtain to some extent and to which i have in one instance in a different capacity give my assent that of subscribe to the stock of private association positive experience and a more thorough consideration of the subject have convince i of the impropriety as well as inexpediency of such investment all improvement effect by the fund of the nation for general use should be open to the enjoyment of all our fellow citizen exempt from the payment of toll or any imposition of that character the practice of thus mingle the concern of the government with those of the state or of individual be inconsistent with the object of its institution and highly impolitic the successful operation of the federal system can only be preserve by confine it to the few and simple but yet important object for which it be design a different practice if allow to progress would ultimately change the character of this government by consolidate into one the general and state government which be intend to be keep for ever distinct i can not perceive how bill authorize such subscription can be otherwise regard than as bill for revenue and consequently subject to the rule in that respect prescribe by the constitution if the interest of the government in private company be subordinate to that of individual the management and control of a portion of the public fund be delegate to an authority unknown to the constitution and beyond the supervision of our constituent if superior its officer and agent will be constantly expose to imputation of favoritism and oppression direct prejudice the public interest or an alienation of the affection and respect of portion of the people may therefore in addition to the general discredit result to the government from embark with its constituent in pecuniary stipulation be look for as the probable fruit of such association it be no answer to this objection to say that the extent of consequence like these can not be great from a limited and small number of investment because experience in other matter teach we and we be not at liberty to disregard its admonition that unless an entire stop be put to they it will soon be impossible to prevent their accumulation until they be spread over the whole country and make to embrace many of the private and appropriate concern of individual the power which the general government would acquire within the several state by become the principal stockholder in corporation control every canal and each 60 or 100 mile of every important road and give a proportionate vote in all their election be almost inconceivable and in my view dangerous to the liberty of the people this mode of aid such work be also in its nature deceptive and in many case conducive to improvidence in the administration of the national fund appropriation will be obtain with much great facility and grant with less security to the public interest when the measure be thus disguise than when definite and direct expenditure of money be ask for the interest of the nation would doubtless be well serve by avoid all such indirect mode of aid particular object in a government like our more especially should all public act be as far as practicable simple undisguised and intelligible that they may become fit subject for the approbation to animadversion of the people the bill authorize a subscription to the louisville and portland canal afford a striking illustration of the difficulty of withhold additional appropriation for the same object when the first erroneous step have be take by institute a partnership between the government and private company it propose a third subscription on the part of the united states when each precede one be at the time regard as the extent of the aid which government be to render to that work and the accompany bill for light house etc contain an appropriation for a survey of the bed of the river with a view to its improvement by remove the obstruction which the canal be design to avoid this improvement if successful would afford a free passage of the river and render the canal entirely useless to such improvidence be the course of legislation subject in relation to internal improvement on local matter even with the good intention on the part of congress although the motive which have influence i in this matter may be already sufficiently state i be never the less induce by its importance to add a few observation of a general character in my objection to the bill authorize subscription to the maysville and rockville road company i express my view fully in regard to the power of congress to construct road and canal within a state of to appropriate money for improvement of a local character i at the same time intimate i belief that the right to make appropriation for such as be of a national character have be so generally act upon and so long acquiesce in by the federal and state government and the constituent of each as to justify its exercise on the ground of continued and uninterrupted usage but that it be never the less highly expedient that appropriation even of that character should with the exception make at the time be defer until the national debt be pay and that in the mean while some general rule for the action of the government in that respect ought to be establish these suggestion be not necessary to the decision of the question then before i and be i readily admit intend to awake the attention and draw forth the opinion and observation of our constituent upon a subject of the high importance to their interest and 1 destine to exert a powerful influence upon the future operation of our political system i know of no tribunal to which a public man in this country in a case of doubt and difficulty can appeal with great advantage or more propriety than the judgment of the people and although i must necessarily in the discharge of my official duty be govern by the dictate of my own judgment i have no desire to conceal my anxious wish to conform as far as i can to the view of those for whom i act all irregular expression of public opinion be of necessity attend with some doubt as to their accuracy but make full allowance on that account i can not i think deceive myself in believe that the act refer to as well as the suggestion which i allow myself to make in relation to their bearing upon the future operation of the government have be approve by the great body of the people that those whose immediate pecuniary interest be to be affect by propose expenditure should shrink from the application of a rule which prefer their more general and remote interest to those which be personal and immediate be to be expect but even such objection must from the nature of our population be but temporary in their duration and if it be otherwise our course should be the same for the time be yet i hope far distant when those intrust with power to be exercise for the good of the whole will consider it either honest or wise to purchase local favor at the sacrifice of principle and general good so understand public sentiment and thoroughly satisfied that the good interest of our common country imperiously require that the course which i have recommend in this regard should be adopt i have upon the most mature consideration determine to pursue it it be due to candor as well as to my own feeling that i should express the reluctance and anxiety which i must at all time experience in exercise the undoubted right of the executive to withhold his assent from bill on other ground than their constitutionality that this right should not be exercise on slight occasion all will admit it be only in matter of deep interest when the principle involve may be justly regard as next in importance to infraction of the constitution itself that such a step can be expect to meet with the approbation of the people such an occasion do i conscientiously believe the present to be in the discharge of this delicate and highly responsible duty i be sustain by the reflection that the exercise of this power have be deem consistent with the obligation of official duty by several of my predecessor and by the persuasion too that what ever liberal institution may have to fear from the encroachment of executive power which have be every where the cause of so much strife and bloody contention but little danger be to be apprehend from a precedent by which that authority deny to itself the exercise of power that bring in their train influence and patronage of great extent and thus exclude the operation of personal interest every where the bane of official trust i derive too no small degree of satisfaction from the reflection that if i have mistake the interest and wish of the people the constitution afford the mean of soon redress the error by select for the place their favor have bestow upon i a citizen whose opinion may accord with their own i trust in the mean time the interest of the nation will be save from prejudice by a rigid application of that portion of the public fund which might otherwise be apply to different object to that high of all our obligation the payment of the public debt and an opportunity be afford for the adoption of some well rule for the operation of the government in this matter than any which have hitherto be act upon profoundly impressed with the importance of the subject not merely as relate to the general prosperity of the country but to the safety of the federal system i can not avoid repeat my earnest hope that all good citizen who take a proper interest in the success and harmony of our admirable political institution and who be incapable of desire to convert an opposite state of thing into mean for the gratification of personal ambition will lay aside minor consideration and discard local prejudice unite their honest exertion to establish some fix general principle which shall be calculate to effect the great extent of public good in regard to the subject of internal improvement and afford the least ground for sectional discontent the general ground of my objection to local appropriation have be heretofore express and i shall endeavor to avoid a repetition of what have be already urge the importance of sustain the state sovereignty as far as be consistent with the rightful action of the federal government and of preserve the great attainable harmony between they i will now only add an expression of my conviction a conviction which every day 's experience serve to confirm that the political creed which inculcate the pursuit of those great object as a paramount duty be the true faith and one to which we be mainly indebted for the present success of the entire system and to which we must alone look for its future stability that there be diversity in the interest of the different state which compose this extensive confederacy must be admit those diversity arise from situation climate population and pursuit be doubtless as it be natural they should be greatly exaggerate by jealousy and that spirit of rivalry so inseparable from neighboring community these circumstance make it the duty of those who be intrust with the management of its affair to neutralize their effect as far as practicable by make the beneficial operation of the federal government as equal and equitable among the several state as can be do consistently with the great end of its institution it be only necessary to refer to undoubted fact to see how far the past act of the government upon the subject under consideration have fall short of this object the expenditure heretofore make for internal improvement amount to upward of $ 5 million and have be distribute in very unequal proportion amongst the state the estimate expense of work of which survey have be make together with that of other project and partially survey amount to more than $ 96 million that such improvement on account of particular circumstance may be more advantageously and beneficially make in some state than in other be doubtless true but that they be of a character which should prevent an equitable distribution of the fund amongst the several state be not to be concede the want of this equitable distribution can not fail to prove a prolific source of irritation among the state we have it constantly before our eye that profession of superior zeal in the cause of internal improvement and a disposition to lavish the public fund upon object of this character be daily and earnestly put forth by aspirant to power as constitute the high claim to the confidence of the people would it be strange under such circumstance and in time of great excitement that grant of this description should find their motive in object which may not accord with the public good those who have not have occasion to see and regret the indication of a sinister influence in these matter in past time have be more fortunate than myself in their observation of the course of public affair if to these evil be add the combination and angry contention to which such a course of thing give rise with their baleful influence upon the legislation of congress touch the lead and appropriate duty of the federal government it be but do justice to the character of our people to expect the severe condemnation of the past which the recent exhibition of public sentiment have evince nothing short of a radical change in the action of the government upon the subject can in my opinion remedy the evil if as it would be natural to expect the state which have be least favor in past appropriation should insist on be redress in those here after to be make at the expense of the state which have so largely and disproportionately participate we have as matter now stand but little security that the attempt would do more than change the inequality from one quarter to another thus view the subject i have heretofore feel it my duty to recommend the adoption of some plan for the distribution of the surplus fund which may at any time remain in the treasury after the national debt shall have be pay among the state in proportion to the number of their representatives to be apply by they to object of internal improvement although this plan have meet with favor in some portion of the union it have also elicit objection which merit deliberate consideration a brief notice of these objection here will not therefore i trust be regard as out of place they rest as far as they have come to my knowledge on the following ground first an objection to the ration of distribution second an apprehension that the existence of such a regulation would produce improvident and oppressive taxation to raise the fund for distribution third that the mode propose would lead to the construction of work of a local nature to the exclusion of such as be general and as would consequently be of a more useful character and last that it would create a discreditable and injurious dependence on the part of the state government upon the federal power of those who object to the ration of representative as the basis of distribution some insist that the importation of the respective state would constitute one that would be more equitable and other again that the extent of their respective territory would furnish a standard which would be more expedient and sufficiently equitable the ration of representation present itself to my mind and it still do as one of obvious equity because of its be the ratio of contribution whether the fund to be distribute be derive from the custom or from direct taxation it do not follow however that its adoption be indispensable to the establishment of the system propose there may be consideration appertain to the subject which would render a departure to some extent from the rule of contribution proper nor be it absolutely necessary that the basis of distribution be confine to one ground it may if in the judgment of those whose right it be to fix it it be deem politic and just to give it that character have regard to several in my first message i state it to be my opinion that it be not probably that any adjustment of the tariff upon principle satisfactory to the people of the union will until a remote period if ever leave the government without a considerable surplus in the treasury beyond what may be require for its current surplus i have have no cause to change that opinion but much to confirm it should these expectation be realize a suitable fund would thus be produce for the plan under consideration to operate upon and if there be no such fund its adoption will in my opinion work no injury to any interest for i can not assent to the justness of the apprehension that the establishment of the propose system would tend to the encouragement of improvident legislation of the character suppose what ever the proper authority in the exercise of constitutional power shall at any time here after decide to be for the general good will in that as in other respect deserve and receive the acquiescence and support of the whole country and we have ample security that every abuse of power in that regard by agent of the people will receive a speedy and effectual corrective at their hand the view which i take of the future found on the obvious and increase improvement of all class of our fellow citizen in intelligence and in public and private virtue leave i without much apprehension on that head i do not doubt that those who come after we will be as much alive as we be to the obligation upon all the trustee of political power to exempt those for whom they act from all unnecessary burthen and as sensible of the great truth that the resource of the nation beyond those require for immediate and necessary purpose of government can no where be so well deposit as in the pocket of the people it may some time happen that the interest of particular state would not be deem to coincide with the general interest in relation to improvement within such state but if the danger to be apprehend from this source be sufficient to require it a discretion might be reserve to congress to direct to such improvement of a general character as the state concern might not be dispose to unite in the application of the quota of those state under the restriction of confine to each state the expenditure of its appropriate quota it may however be assume as a safe general rule that such improvement as serve to increase the prosperity of the respective state in which they be make by give new facility to trade and thereby augment the wealth and comfort of their inhabitant constitute the sure mode of confer permanent and substantial advantage upon the whole the strength as well as the true glory of the confederacy be found on the prosperity and power of the several independent sovereignty of which it be compose and the certainty with which they can be bring into successful active cooperation through the agency of the federal government it be more over within the knowledge of such as be at all conversant with public affair that scheme of internal improvement have from time to time be propose which from their extent and seeming magnificence be readily regard as of national concernment but which upon full consideration and further experience would now be reject with great unanimity that the plan under consideration would derive important advantage from its certainty and that the money set apart for these purpose would be more judiciously apply and economically expend under the direction of the state legislature in which every part of each state be immediately represent can not i think be doubt in the new state particularly where a comparatively small population be scatter over an extensive surface and the representation in congress consequently very limited it be natural to expect that the appropriation make by the federal government would be more likely to be expend in the vicinity of those number through whose immediate agency they be obtain than if the fund be place under the control of the legislature in which every county of the state have its own representative this supposition do not necessarily impugn the motive of such congressional representative nor be it so intended we be all sensible of the bias to which the strong mind and pure heart be under such circumstance liable in respect to the last objection its probable effect upon the dignity and independence of state government it appear to i only necessary to state the case as it be and as it would be if the measure propose be adopt to show that the operation be most likely to be the very reverse of that which the objection suppose in the one case the state would receive its quota of the national revenue for domestic use upon a fix principle as a matter of right and from a fund to the creation of which it have itself contribute its fair proportion surely there could be nothing derogatory in that as matter now stand the state themselves in their sovereign character be not unfrequently petitioner at the bar of the federal legislature for such allowance out of the national treasury as it may comport with their pleasure or sense of duty to bestow upon they it can not require argument to prove which of the two course be most compatible with the efficiency or respectability of the state government but all these be matter for discussion and dispassionate consideration that the desire adjustment would be attend with difficulty afford no reason why it should not be attempt the effective operation of such motive would have prevent the adoption of the constitution under which we have so long live and under the benign influence of which our beloved country have so signally prosper the framer of that sacred instrument have great difficulty to overcome and they do overcome they the patriotism of the people direct by a deep conviction of the importance of the union produce mutual concession and reciprocal forbearance strict right be merge in a spirit of compromise and the result have consecrate their disinterested devotion to the general weal unless the american people have degenerate the same result can be again effect when ever experience point out the necessity of a resort to the same mean to uphold the fabric which their father have rear it be beyond the power of man to make a system of government like our or any other operate with precise equality upon state situate like those which compose this confederacy nor be inequality always injustice every state can not expect to shape the measure of the general government to suit its own particular interest the cause which prevent it be seat in the nature of thing and can not be entirely counteract by human mean mutual forbearance become therefore a duty obligatory upon all and we may i be confident count upon a cheerful compliance with this high injunction on the part of our constituent it be not to be suppose that they will object to make such comparatively inconsiderable sacrifice for the preservation of right and privilege which other less favor portion of the world have in vain wade through sea of blood to acquire our course be a safe one if it be but faithfully adhere to acquiescence in the constitutionally express will of the majority and the exercise of that will in a spirit of moderation justice and brotherly kindness will constitute a cement which would for ever preserve our union those who cherish and inculcate sentiment like these render a most essential service to their country while those who seek to weaken their influence be how ever conscientious and praise worthy their intention in effect its bad enemy if the intelligence and influence of the country instead of labor to foment sectional prejudice to be make subservient to party warfare be in good faith apply to the eradication of cause of local discontent by the improvement of our institution and by facilitate their adaptation to the condition of the time this task would prove 1 of less difficulty may we not hope that the obvious interest of our common country and the dictate of an enlightened patriotism will in the end lead the public mind in that direction?after all the nature of the subject do not admit of a plan wholly free from objection that which have for some time be in operation be perhaps the bad that could exist and every advance that can be make in its improvement be a matter eminently worthy of your most deliberate attention it be very possible that one well calculate to effect the object in view may yet be devise if so it be to be hope that those who disapprove the past and dissent from what be propose for the future will feel it their duty to direct their attention to it as they must be sensible that unless some fix rule for the action of the federal government in this respect be establish the course now attempt to be arrest will be again resort to any mode which be calculate to give the great degree of effect and harmony to our legislation upon the subject which shall well serve to keep the movement of the federal government within the sphere intend by those who model and those who adopt it which shall lead to the extinguishment of the national debt in the short period and impose the light burthen upon our constituent shall receive from i a cordial and firm support among the object of great national concern i can not omit to press again upon your attention that part of the constitution which regulate the election of president and vice president the necessity for its amendment be make so clear to my mind by observation of its evil and by the many able discussion which they have elicit on the floor of congress and elsewhere that i should be want to my duty be i to withhold another expression of my deep solicitude on the subject our system fortunately contemplate a recurrence to first principle differ in this respect from all that have precede it and secure it i trust equally against the decay and the commotion which have mark the progress of other government our fellow citizen too who in proportion to their love of liberty keep a steady eye upon the mean of sustain it do not require to be remind of the duty they owe to themselves to remedy all essential defect in so vital a part of their system while they be sensible that every evil attendant upon its operation be not necessarily indicative of a bad organization but may proceed from temporary cause yet the habitual presence or even a single instance of evil which can be clearly trace to an organic defect will not i trust be overlook through a too scrupulous veneration for the work of their ancestor the constitution be an experiment commit to the virtue and intelligence of the great mass of our countryman in whose rank the framer of it themselves be to perform the part of patriotic observation and scrutiny and if they have pass from the stage of existence with an increase confidence in its general adaptation to our condition we should learn from authority so high the duty of fortify the point in it which time prove to be expose rather than be deter from approach they by the suggestion of fear or the dictate of misplaced reverence a provision which do not secure to the people a direct choice of their chief magistrate but have a tendency to defeat their will present to my mind such an inconsistence with the general spirit of our institution that i be indeed to suggest for your consideration the substitute which appear to i at the same time the most likely to correct the evil and to meet the view of our constituent the most mature reflection since have add strength to the belief that the good interest of our country require the speedy adoption of some plan calculate to effect this end a contingency which some time place it in the power of a single member of the house of representatives to decide an election of so high and solemn a character be unjust to the people and become when it occur a source of embarrassment to the individual thus bring into power and a cause of distrust of the representative body liable as the confederacy be from its great extent to party found upon sectional interest and to a corresponding multiplication of candidate for the presidency the tendency of the constitutional reference to the house of representatives be to devolve the election upon that body in almost every instance and what ever choice may then be make among the candidate thus present to they to swell the influence of particular interest to a degree inconsistent with the general good the consequence of this feature of the constitution appear far more threatening to the peace and integrity of the union than any which i can conceive as likely to result from the simple legislative action of the federal government it be a lead object with the framer of the constitution to keep as separate as possible the action of the legislative and executive branch of the government to secure this object nothing be more essential than to preserve the former from all temptation of private interest and therefore so to direct the patronage of the latter as not to permit such temptation to be offer experience abundantly demonstrate that every precaution in this respect be a valuable safeguard of liberty and one which my reflection upon the tendency of our system incline i to think should be make still strong it be for this reason that in connection with an amendment of the constitution remove all intermediate agency in the choice of the president i recommend some restriction upon the re eligibility of that officer and upon the tenure of office generally the reason still exist and i renew the recommendation with an increase confidence that its adoption will strengthen those check by which the constitution design to secure the independence of each department of the government and promote the healthful and equitable administration of all the trust which it have create the agent most likely to contravene this design of the constitution be the chief magistrate in order particularly that his appointment may as far as possible be place beyond the reach of any improper influence in order that he may approach the solemn responsibility of the high office in the gift of a free people uncommitte to any other course than the strict line of constitutional duty and that the security for this independence may be render as strong as the nature of power and the weakness of its possessor will admit i can not too earnestly invite your attention to the propriety of promote such an amendment of the constitution as will render he ineligible after one term of service it give i pleasure to announce to congress that the benevolent policy of the government steadily pursue for nearly 30 year in relation to the removal of the indians beyond the white settlement be approach to a happy consummation two important tribe have accept the provision make for their removal at the last session of congress and it be believe that their example will induce the remain tribe also to seek the same obvious advantage the consequence of a speedy removal will be important to the united states to individual state and to the indians themselves the pecuniary advantage which it promise to the government be the least of its recommendation it put an end to all possible danger of collision between the authority of the general and state government on account of the indians it will place a dense and civilized population in large tract of country now occupy by a few savage hunter by open the whole territory between tennessee on the north and louisiana on the south to the settlement of the white it will incalculably strengthen the sw frontier and render the adjacent state strong enough to repel future invasion without remote aid it will relieve the whole state of mississippi and the western part of alabama of indian occupancy and enable those state to advance rapidly in population wealth and power it will separate the indians from immediate contact with settlement of white free they from the power of the state enable they to pursue happiness in their own way and under their own rude institution will retard the progress of decay which be lessen their number and perhaps cause they gradually under the protection of the government and through the influence of good counsel to cast off their savage habit and become an interesting civilized and christian community these consequence some of they so certain and the rest so probable make the complete execution of the plan sanction by congress at their last session an object of much solicitude toward the aborigine of the country no one can indulge a more friendly feeling than myself or would go far in attempt to reclaim they from their wandering habit and make they a happy prosperous people i have endeavor to impress upon they my own solemn conviction of the duty and power of the general government in relation to the state authority for the justice of the law pass by the state within the scope of their reserved power they be not responsible to this government as individual we may entertain and express our opinion of their act but as a government we have as little right to control they as we have to prescribe law for other nation with a full understanding of the subject the choctaw and the chickasaw tribe have with great unanimity determine to avail themselves of the liberal offer present by the act of congress and have agree to remove beyond the mississippi river treaty have be make with they which in due season will be submit for consideration in negotiate these treaty they be make to understand their true condition and they have prefer maintain their independence in the western forest to submit to the law of the state in which they now reside these treaty be probably the last which will ever be make with they be characterize by great liberality on the part of the government they give the indians a liberal sum in consideration of their removal and comfortable subsistence on their arrival at their new home if it be their real interest to maintain a separate existence they will there be at liberty to do so without the inconvenience and vexation to which they would unavoidably have be subject in alabama and mississippi humanity have often weep over the fate of the aborigine of this country and philanthropy have be long busily employ in devising mean to avert it but its progress have never for a moment be arrest and one by one have many powerful tribe disappear from the earth to follow to the tomb the last of his race and to tread on the grave of extinct nation excite melancholy reflection but true philanthropy reconcile the mind to these vicissitude as it do to the extinction of one generation to make room for another in the monument and fortification of an unknown people spread over the extensive region of the west we behold the memorial of a once powerful race which be exterminate of have disappear to make room for the exist savage tribe nor be there any thing in this which upon a comprehensive view of the general interest of the human race be to be regret philanthropy could not wish to see this continent restore to the condition in which it be find by our forefather what good man would prefer a country cover with forest and range by a few thousand savage to our extensive republic stud with city town and prosperous farm embellish with all the improvement which art can devise or industry execute occupy by more than 12,000,000 happy people and fill with all the blessing of liberty civilization and religion?the present policy of the government be but a continuation of the same progressive change by a milder process the tribe which occupy the country now constitute the eastern state be annihilate or have melt away to make room for the white the wave of population and civilization be roll to the westward and we now propose to acquire the country occupy by the red man of the south and west by a fair exchange and at the expense of the united states to send they to a land where their existence may be prolong and perhaps make perpetual doubtless it will be painful to leave the grave of their father but what do they more than our ancestor do or than our child be now do to better their condition in an unknown land our forefather leave all that be dear in earthly object our child by thousand yearly leave the land of their birth to seek new home in distant region do humanity weep at these painful separation from every thing animate and inanimate with which the young heart have become entwine far from it it be rather a source of joy that our country afford scope where our young population may range unconstrained in body or in mind develop the power and faculty of man in their high perfection these remove hundred and almost thousand of mile at their own expense purchase the land they occupy and support themselves at their new home from the moment of their arrival can it be cruel in this government when by event which it can not control the indian be make discontent in his ancient home to purchase his land to give he a new and extensive territory to pay the expense of his removal and support he a year in his new abode how many thousand of our own people would gladly embrace the opportunity of remove to the west on such condition if the offer make to the indians be extend to they they would be hail with gratitude and joy and be it suppose that the wandering savage have a strong attachment to his home than the settle civilized christian be it more afflict to he to leave the grave of his father than it be to our brother and child rightly consider the policy of the general government toward the red man be not only liberal but generous he be unwilling to submit to the law of the state and mingle with their population to save he from this alternative or perhaps utter annihilation the general government kindly offer he a new home and propose to pay the whole expense of his removal and settlement in the consummation of a policy originating at an early period and steadily pursue by every administration within the present century so just to the state and so generous to the indians the executive feel it have a right to expect the cooperation of congress and of all good and disinterested man the state moreover have a right to demand it it be substantially a part of the compact which make they member of our confederacy with georgia there be an express contract with the new state an implied one of equal obligation why in authorize ohio indiana illinois missouri mississippi and alabama to form constitution and become separate state do congress include within their limit extensive tract of indian land and in some instance powerful indian tribe be it not understand by both party that the power of the state be to be coextensive with their limit and that with all convenient dispatch the general government should extinguish the indian title and remove every obstruction to the complete jurisdiction of the state government over the soil probably not one of those state would have accept a separate existence certainly it would never have be grant by congress have it be understand that they be to be confine for ever to those small portion of their nominal territory the indian title to which have at the time be extinguish it be therefore a duty which this government owe to the new state to extinguish as soon as possible the indian title to all land which congress themselves have include within their limit when this be do the duty of the general government in relation to the state and the indians within their limit be at an end the indians may leave the state or not as they choose the purchase of their land do not alter in the least their personal relation with the state government no act of the general government have ever be deem necessary to give the state jurisdiction over the person of the indians that they possess by virtue of their sovereign power within their own limit in as full a manner before as after the purchase of the indian land nor can this government add to or diminish it may we not hope therefore that all good citizen and none more zealously than those who think the indians oppress by subjection to the law of the state will unite in attempt to open the eye of those child of the forest to their true condition and by a speedy removal to relieve they from all the evil real or imaginary present or prospective with which they may be suppose to be threaten among the numerous cause of congratulation the condition of our impost revenue deserve special mention in as much as it promise the mean of extinguish the public debt soon than be anticipate and furnish a strong illustration of the practical effect of the present tariff upon our commercial interest the object of the tariff be object to by some as unconstitutional and it be consider by almost all as defective in many of its part the power to impose duty on import originally belong to the several state the right to adjust those duty with a view to the encouragement of domestic branch of industry be so completely incidental to that power that it be difficult to suppose the existence of the one without the other the state have delegate their whole authority over import to the general government without limitation or restriction save the very inconsiderable reservation relate to their inspection law this authority having thus entirely pass from the state the right to exercise it for the purpose of protection do not exist in they and consequently if it be not possess by the general government it must be extinct our political system would thus present the anomaly of a people strip of the right to foster their own industry and to counteract the most selfish and destructive policy which might be adopt by foreign nation this sure can not be the case this indispensable power thus surrender by the state must be within the scope of the authority on the subject expressly delegate to congress in this conclusion i be confirm as well by the opinion of presidents washington jefferson madison and monroe who have each repeatedly recommend the exercise of this right under the constitution as by the uniform practice of congress the continued acquiescence of the state and the general understanding of the people the difficulty of a more expedient adjustment of the present tariff although great be far from be insurmountable some be unwilling to improve any of its part because they would destroy the whole other fear to touch the objectionable part lest those they approve should be jeoparde i be persuade that the advocate of these conflict view do injustice to the american people and to their representative the general interest be the interest of each and my confidence be entire that to insure the adoption of such modification of the tariff as the general interest require it be only necessary that that interest should be understand it be an infirmity of our nature to mingle our interest and prejudice with the operation of our reasoning power and attribute to the object of our like and dislike quality they do not possess and effect they can not produce the effect of the present tariff be doubtless over rate both in its evil and in its advantage by one class of reasoner the reduce price of cotton and other agricultural product be ascribe wholly to its influence and by another the reduce price of manufacture article the probability be that neither opinion approach the truth and that both be induce by that influence of interest and prejudice to which i have refer the decrease of price extend throughout the commercial world embrace not only the raw material and the manufactured article but provision and land the cause must therefore be deep and more pervading than the tariff of the united states it may in a measure be attributable to the increase value of the precious metal produce by a diminution of the supply and an increase in the demand while commerce have rapidly extend itself and population have augment the supply of gold and silver the general medium of exchange have be greatly interrupt by civil convulsion in the country from which they be principally draw a part of the effect too be doubtless owe to an increase of operative and improvement in machinery but on the whole it be questionable whether the reduction in the price of land produce and manufacture have be great than the appreciation of the standard of value while the chief object of duty should be revenue they may be so adjusted as to encourage manufacture in this adjustment however it be the duty of the government to be guide by the general good object of national importance alone ought to be protect of these the production of our soil our mine and our work shop essential to national defense occupy the first rank what ever other specie of domestic industry have the importance to which i have refer may be expect after temporary protection to compete with foreign labor on equal term merit the same attention in a subordinate degree the present tariff taxis some of the comfort of life unnecessarily high it undertake to protect interest too local and minute to justify a general exaction and it also attempt to force some kind of manufacture for which the country be not ripe much relief will be derive in some of these respect from the measure of your last session the good as well as fairest mode of determine whether from any just consideration a particular interest ought to receive protection would be to submit the question singly for deliberation if after due examination of its merit unconnected with extraneous consideration such as a desire to sustain a general system or to purchase support for a different interest it should enlist in its favor a majority of the representative of the people there can be little danger of wrong or injury in adjust the tariff with reference to its protective effect if this obviously just principle be honestly adhere to the branch of industry which deserve protection would be save from the prejudice excited against they when that protection form part of a system by which portion of the country feel or conceive themselves to be oppress what be incalculably more important the vital principle of our system that principle which require acquiescence in the will of the majority would be secure from the discredit and danger to which it be expose by the act of majority found not on identity of conviction but on combination of small minority enter into for the purpose of mutual assistance in measure which rest solely on their own merit could never be carry i be well aware that this be a subject of so much delicacy on account of the extended interest in involve as to require that it should be touch with the utmost caution and that while an abandonment of the policy in which it originate a policy coeval with our government and pursue through successive administration be neither to be expect or desire the people have a right to demand and have demand that it be so modified as to correct abuse and obviate injustice that our deliberation on this interesting subject should be uninfluence by those partisan conflict that be incident to free institution be the fervent wish of my heart to make this great question which unhappily so much divide and excite the public mind subservient to the short sighted view of faction must destroy all hope of settle it satisfactorily to the great body of the people and for the general interest i can not therefore in take leave of the subject too earnestly for my own feeling or the common good warn you against the blight consequence of such a course accord to the estimate at the treasury department the receipt in the treasury during the present year will amount to $ 24,161,018 which will exceed by about $ 300,000 the estimate present in the last annual report of the secretary of the treasury the total expenditure during the year exclusive of public debt be estimate at $ 13,742,311 and the payment on account of public debt for the same period will have be $ 11,354,630 leave a balance in the treasury on 1831 01 01 of $ 4,819,781.in connection with the condition of our finance it afford i pleasure to remark that judicious and efficient arrangement have be make by the treasury department for secure the pecuniary responsibility of the public officer and the more punctual payment of the public due the revenue cutter service have be organize and place on a good footing and aid by an increase of inspector at expose point and regulation adopt under the act of 1830 05 for the inspection and appraisement of merchandise have produce much improvement in the execution of the law and more security against the commission of fraud upon the revenue abuse in the allowance for fishing bounty have also be correct and a material saving in that branch of the service thereby effect in addition to these improvement the system of expenditure for sick sea man belong to the merchant service have be revise and be render uniform and economical the benefit of the fund applicable to this object have be usefully extend the prosperity of our country be also far evince by the increase revenue arise from the sale of public land as will appear from the report of the commissioner of the general land office and the document accompany it which be herewith transmit i beg leave to draw your attention to this report and to the propriety of make early appropriation for the object which it specify your attention be again invite to the subject connect with that portion of the public interest intrust to the war department some of they be refer to in my former message and they be present in detail in the report of the secretary of war herewith submit i refer you also to the report of that officer for a knowledge of the state of the army fortification arsenal and indian affair all of which it will be perceive have be guard with zealous attention and care it be worthy of your consideration whether the armament necessary for the fortification on our maritime frontier which be now or shortly will be complete should not be in readiness soon than the customary appropriation will enable the department to provide they this precaution seem to be due to the general system of fortification which have be sanction by congress and be recommend by that maxim of wisdom which tell we in peace to prepare for war i refer you to the report of the secretary of the navy for a highly satisfactory account of the manner in which the concern of that department have be conduct during the present year our position in relation to the most powerful nation of the earth and the present condition of europe admonish we to cherish this arm of our national defense with peculiar care separate by wide sea from all those government whose power we might have reason to dread we have nothing to apprehend from attempt at conquest it be chiefly attack upon our commerce and harrasse in road upon our coast against which we have to guard a naval force adequate to the protection of our commerce always afloat with an accumulation of the mean to give it a rapid extension in case of need furnish the power by which all such aggression may be prevent or repel the attention of the government have therefore be recently direct more to preserve the public vessel already build and provide material to be place in depot for future use than to increase their number with the aid of congress in a few year the government will be prepare in case of emergency to put afloat a powerful navy of new ship almost as soon as old one could be repair the modification in this part of the service suggest in my last annual message which be notice more in detail in the report of the secretary of the navy be again recommend to your serious attention the report of the postmaster general in like manner exhibit a satisfactory view of the important branch of the government under his charge in addition to the benefit already secure by the operation of the post office department considerable improvement within the present year have be make by an increase in the accommodation afford by stage coach and in the frequency and celerity of the mail between some of the most important point of the union under the late contract improvement have be provide for the southern section of the country and at the same time an annual saving make of upward of $ 72,000 not with stand the excess of expenditure beyond the current receipt for a few year past necessarily incur in the fulfillment of exist contract and in the additional expense between the period of contracting to meet the demand create by the rapid growth and extension of our flourish country yet the satisfactory assurance be give that the future revenue of the department will be sufficient to meet its extensive engagement the system recently introduce that subject its receipt and disbursement to strict regulation have entirely fulfil its design it give full assurance of the punctual transmission as well as the security of the fund of the department the efficiency and industry of its officer and the ability and energy of contractor justify an increase confidence in its continued prosperity the attention of congress be call on a former occasion to the necessity of such a modification in the office of attorney general of the united states as would render it more adequate to the want of the public service this result in the establishment of the office of solicitor of the treasury and the early measure be take to give effect to the provision of the law which authorize the appointment of that officer and define his duty but it be not believe that this provision however useful in itself be calculate to supersede the necessity of extend the duty and power of the attorney general 's office on the contrary i be convinced that the public interest would be greatly promote by give to that officer the general superintendence of the various law agent of the government and of all law proceeding whether civil or criminal in which the united states may be interested allow he at the same time such compensation as would enable he to devote his undivided attention to the public business i think such a provision be alike due to the public and to the officer occasion of reference from the different executive department to the attorney general be of frequent occurrence and the prompt decision of the question so refer tend much to facilitate the dispatch of business in those department the report of the secretary of the treasury hereto append show also a branch of the public service not specifically intrust to any officer which might be advantageously commit to the attorney general but independently of those consideration this office be now one of daily duty it be originally organize and its compensation fix with a view to occasional service leave to the incumbent time for the exercise of his profession in private practice the state of thing which warrant such an organization no long exist the frequent claim upon the service of this officer would render his absence from the seat of government in professional attendance upon the court injurious to the public service and the interest of the government could not fail to be promote by charge he with the general superintendence of all its legal concern under a strong conviction of the justness of these suggestion i recommend it to congress to make the necessary provision for give effect to they and to place the attorney general in regard to compensation on the same footing with the head of the several executive department to this officer might also be intrust a cognizance of the case of insolvency in public debtor especially if the view which i submit on this subject last year should meet the approbation of congress to which i again solicit your attention your attention be respectfully invite to the situation of the district of columbia place by the constitution under the exclusive jurisdiction and control of congress this district be certainly entitle to a much great share of its consideration than it have yet receive there be a want of uniformity in its law particularly in those of a penal character which increase the expense of their administration and subject the people to all the inconvenience which result from the operation of different code in so small a territory on different side of the potomac the same offense be punishable in unequal degree and the peculiarity of many of the early law of maryland and virginia remain in force not with stand their repugnance in some case to the improvement which have supersede they in those state besides a remedy for these evil which be loudly call for it be respectfully submit whether a provision authorize the election of a delegate to represent the want of the citizen of this district on the floor of congress be not due to they and to the character of our government no principle of freedom and there be none more important than that which cultivate a proper relation between the governor and the govern imperfect as this must be in this case yet it be believe that it would be greatly improve by a representation in congress with the same privilege that be allow to the other territories of the united states the penitentiary be ready for the reception of convict and only await the necessary legislation to put it into operation as one object of which i beg leave to recall your attention to the propriety of provide suitable compensation for the officer charge with its inspection the importance of the principle involve in the inquiry whether it will be proper to recharter the bank of the united states require that i should again call the attention of congress to the subject nothing have occur to lessen in any degree the danger which many of our citizen apprehend from that institution as at present organize in the spirit of improvement and compromise which distinguish our country and its institution it become we to inquire whether it be not possible to secure the advantage afford by the present bank through the agency of a bank of the united states so modify in its principle and structure as to obviate constitutional and other objection it be think practicable to organize such a bank with the necessary officer as a branch of the treasury department base on the public and individual deposit without power to make loan or purchase property which shall remit the fund of the government and the expense of which may be pay if thought advisable by allow its officer to sell bill of exchange to private individual at a moderate premium not be a corporate body have no stock holder debtor or property and but few officer it would not be obnoxious to the constitutional objection which be urge against the present bank and have no mean to operate on the hope fear or interest of large masse of the community it would be shorn of the influence which make that bank formidable the state would be strengthen by have in their hand the mean of furnish the local paper currency through their own bank while the bank of the united states though issue no paper would check the issue of the state bank by take their note in deposit and for exchange only so long as they continue to be redeem with specie in time of public emergency the capacity of such an institution might be enlarge by legislative provision these suggestion be make not so much as a recommendation as with a view of call the attention of congress to the possible modification of a system which can not continue to exist in its present form without occasional collision with the local authority and perpetual apprehension and discontent on the part of the state and the people in conclusion fellow citizen allow i to invoke in behalf of your deliberation that spirit of conciliation and disinterestedness which be the gift of patriotism under an overruling and merciful providence the agency of this spirit have thus far be signalize in the prosperity and glory of our beloved country may its influence be eternal
to the senate of the united states
 i have receive your resolution of the 15th instant request i to inform the senate whether the provision of the act entitle 39;an act to regulate trade and intercourse with the indian tribe and to preserve peace on the frontier pass the 30th of march 1802 have be fully comply with on the part of the united states government and if they have not that he inform the senate of the reason that have induce the government to decline the enforcement of say act and i now reply to the same
 accord to my view of the act refer to i be not aware of any omission to carry into effect its provision in relation to trade and intercourse with the indian tribe so far as their execution depend on the agency confide to the executive
 the numerous provision of that act design to secure to the indians the peaceable possession of their land may be reduce substantially to the following that citizen of the united states be restrain under sufficient penalty from enter upon the land for the purpose of hunt thereon or of settle they or of give their horse and cattle the benefit of a range upon they or of travel through they without a write permission and that the president of the united states be authorize to employ the military force of the country to secure the observance of these provision the authority to the president however be not imperative the language be
 it shall be lawful for the president to take such measure and to employ such military force as he may judge necessary to remove from land belong to or secure by treaty to any indian tribe any citizen who shall make a settlement thereon
 by the nineteenth section of this act it be provide that nothing in it shall be construe to prevent any trade or intercourse with indians live on land surround by settlement of citizen of the united states and be within the ordinary jurisdiction of any of the individual states this provision i have interpret as be prospective in its operation and as applicable not only to indian tribe which at the date of its passage be subject to the jurisdiction of any state but to such also as should thereafter become so to this construction of its meaning i have endeavor to conform and have take no step inconsistent with it as soon therefore as the sovereign power of the state of georgia be exercise by an extension of her law throughout her limit and i have receive information of the same order be give to withdraw from the state the troop which have be detail to prevent intrusion upon the indian land within it and these order be execute the reason which dictate they shall be frankly communicate
 the principle recognize in the section last quote be not for the first time then avow it be conformable to the uniform practice of the government before the adoption of the constitution and amount to a distinct recognition by congress at that early day of the doctrine that that instrument have not vary the power of the federal government over indian affair from what they be under the articles of confederation it be not believe that there be a single instance in the legislation of the country in which the indians have be regard as possess political right independent of the control and authority of the states within the limit of which they reside as early as the year 1782 the journals of congress will show that no claim of such a character be countenance by that body in that year the application of a tribe of indians reside in south carolina to have certain tract of land which have be reserve for their use in that state secure to they free from intrusion and without the right of alienate they even with their own consent be bring to the consideration of congress by a report from the secretary of war the resolution which be adopt on that occasion be as follow
 resolve that it be recommend to the legislature of south carolina to take such measure for the satisfaction and security of say tribe as the say legislature in their wisdom may think fit
 here be no assertion of the right of congress under the articles of confederation to interfere with the jurisdiction of the states over indians within their limit but rather a negation of it they refuse to interfere with the subject and refer it under a general recommendation back to the state to be dispose of as her wisdom might decide
 if in addition to this act and the language of the articles of confederation anything far can be want to show the early view of the government on the subject it will be find in the proclamation issue by congress in 1783 it contain this language
 the united states in congress assemble have think proper to issue their proclamation and they do hereby prohibit and forbid all person front make settlement on land inhabit or claim by indians without the limit or jurisdiction of any particular state
 and again
 resolve that the precede measure of congress relative to indian affair shall not be construe to affect the territorial claim of any of the states or their legislative right within their respective limit
 it be not then pretend that the general government have the power in their relation with the indians to control or oppose the internal polity of the individual states of this union and if such be the case under the articles of confederation the only question on the subject since must arise out of some more enlarged power or authority give to the general government by the present constitution do any such exist
 amongst the enumerate grant of the constitution that which relate to this subject be express in these word congress shall have power to regulate commerce with the indian tribe in the interpretation of this power we ought certainly to be guide by what have be the practice of the government and the meaning which have be generally attach to the resolve of the old congress if the word use to convey it do not clearly import a different one as far as it affect the question of jurisdiction in the individual states the states ought not to be divest of any part of their antecedent jurisdiction by implication or doubtful construction test by this rule it seem to i to be unquestionable that the jurisdiction of the states be leave untouched by this clause of the constitution and that it be design to give to the general government complete control over the trade and intercourse of those indians only who be not within the limit of any state
 from a view of the act refer to and the uniform practice of the government it be manifest that until recently it have never be maintain that the right of jurisdiction by a state over indians within its territory be subordinate to the power of the federal government that doctrine have not be enforce nor even assert in any of the states of new england where tribe of indians have reside and where a few of they yet remain these tribe have be leave to the undisturbed control of the states in which they be find in conformity with the view which have be take of the opinion prevail up to 1789 and the clear interpretation of the act of 1802 in the state of new york where several tribe have reside it have be the policy of the government to avoid enter into quasi treaty engagement with they barely appoint commissioner occasionally on the part of the united states to facilitate the object of the state in its negotiation with they the southern states present an exception to this policy as early as 1784 the settlement within the limit of north carolina be advance far to the west than the authority of the state to enforce an obedience of its law other be in a similar condition the necessity therefore and not the acknowledge principle of the government must have suggest the policy of treat with the indians in that quarter as the only practicable mode of conciliate their good will the united states at that period have just emerge from a protract war for the achievement of their independence at the moment of its conclusion many of these tribe as powerful as they be ferocious in their mode of warfare remain in arm desolate our frontier settlement under these circumstance the first treaty in 1785 and 1790 with the cherokees be conclude by the government of the united states and be evidently sanction as measure of necessity adapt to the character of the indians and indispensable to the peace and security of the western frontier but they can not be understand as change the political relation of the indians to the states or to the federal government to effect this would have require the operation of quite a different principle and the intervention of a tribunal high than that of the treaty make power
 to infer from the assent of the government to this deviation from the practice which have before govern its intercourse with the indians and the accidental forbearance of the states to assert their right of jurisdiction over they that they have surrender this portion of their sovereignty and that its assumption now be usurpation be concede too much to the necessity which dictate those treaty and do violence to the principle of the government and the right of the states without benefit in the least degree the indians the indians thus situate can not be regard in any other light than as member of a foreign government or of that of the state within whose charter limit they reside if in the former the ordinary legislation of congress in relation to they be not warrant by the constitution which be establish for the benefit of our own not of a foreign people if in the latter then like other citizen or people resident within the limit of the states they be subject to their jurisdiction and control to maintain a contrary doctrine and to require the executive to enforce it by the employment of a military force would be to place in his hand a power to make war upon the right of the states and the liberty of the country a power which should be place in the hand of no individual
 if indeed the indians be to be regard as people possess right which they can exercise independently of the states much error have arise in the intercourse of the government with they why be it that they have be call upon to assist in our war without the privilege of exercise their own discretion if an independent people they should as such be consult and advise with but they have not be in an order which be issue to i from the war department in september 1814 this language be employ
 all the friendly indians should be organize and prepare to cooperate with your other force there appear to be some dissatisfaction among the choctaws their friendship and service should be secure without delay the friendly indians must be feed and pay and make to fight when and where their service may be require
 to an independent and foreign people this would seem to be assume i should suppose rather too lofty a tone one which the government would not have assume if they have consider they in that light again by the constitution the power of declare war belong exclusively to congress we have be often engage in war with the indian tribe within our limit but when have these hostility be precede or accompany by an act of congress declare war against the tribe which be the object of they and be the prosecution of such hostility an usurpation in each case by the executive which conduct they of the constitutional power of congress it must have be so i apprehend if these tribe be to be consider as foreign and independent nation
 the step take to prevent intrusion upon indian land have their origin with the commencement of our government and become the subject of special legislation in 1802 with the reservation which have be mention in favor of the jurisdiction of the states with the exception of south carolina who have uniformly regulate the indians within her limit without the aid of the general government they have be feel within all the states of the south without be understand to affect their right or prevent the exercise of their jurisdiction whenever they be in a situation to assume and enforce it georgia though materially concern have on this principle forborne to spread her legislation far than the settlement of her own white citizen until she have recently perceive within her limit a people claim to be capable of self government sit in legislative council organize court and administer justice to disarm such an anomalous invasion of her sovereignty she have declare her determination to execute her own law throughout her limit a step which seem to have be anticipate by the proclamation of 1783 and which be perfectly consistent with the nineteenth section of the act of 1802 accord to the language and reasoning of that section the tribe to the south and the southwest be not only surround by settlement of the citizen of the united states but be now also within the ordinary jurisdiction of the individual states they become so from the moment the law of the state be extend over they and the same result follow the similar determination of alabama and mississippi these states have each a right to claim in behalf of their position now on this question the same respect which be concede to the other states of the union
 toward this race of people i entertain the kind feeling and be not sensible that the view which i have take of their true interest be less favorable to they than those which oppose their emigration to the west year since i state to they my belief that if the states choose to extend their law over they it would not be in the power of the federal government to prevent it my opinion remain the same and i can see no alternative for they but that of their removal to the west or a quiet submission to the state law if they prefer to remove the united states agree to defray their expense to supply they the mean of transportation and a year&#39;s support after they reach their new home a provision too liberal and kind to deserve the stamp of injustice either course promise they peace and happiness whilst an obstinate perseverance in the effort to maintain their possession independent of the state authority can not fail to render their condition still more helpless and miserable such an effort ought therefore to be discountenance by all who sincerely sympathize in the fortune of this peculiar people and especially by the political body of the union as calculate to disturb the harmony of the two government and to endanger the safety of the many blessing which they enable we to enjoy
 as connect with the subject of this inquiry i beg leave to refer to the accompany letter from the secretary of war inclose the order which proceed from that department and a letter from the governor of georgia

fellow citizen of the senate and house of representatives the representation of the people have be renew for the 22nd time since the constitution they form have be in force for near half a century the chief magistrates who have be successively choose have make their annual communication of the state of the nation to its representative generally these communication have be of the most gratifying nature testify an advance in all the improvement of social and all the security of political life but frequently and justly as you have be call on to be grateful for the bounty of providence at few period have they be more abundantly or extensively bestow than at the present rarely if ever have we have great reason to congratulate each other on the continued and increase prosperity of our beloved country agriculture the first and most important occupation of man have compensate the labor of the husband man with plentiful crop of all the varied product of our extensive country manufacture have be establish in which the fund of the capitalist find a profitable investment and which give employment and subsistence to a numerous and increase body of industrious and dexterous mechanic the laborer be reward by high wage in the construction of work of internal improvement which be extend with unprecedented rapidity science be steadily penetrate the recess of nature and disclose her secret while the ingenuity of free mind be subject the element to the power of man and make each new conquest auxiliary to his comfort by our mail whose speed be regularly increase and whose route be every year extend the communication of public intelligence and private business be render frequent and safe the intercourse between distant city which it formerly require week to accomplish be now effect in a few day and in the construction of rail road and the application of steam power we have a reasonable prospect that the extreme part of our country will be so much approximate and those most isolated by the obstacle of nature render so accessible as to remove an apprehension some time entertain that the great extent of the union would endanger its permanent existence if from the satisfactory view of our agriculture manufacture and internal improvement we turn to the state of our navigation and trade with foreign nation and between the state we shall scarcely find less cause for gratulation a beneficent providence have provide for their exercise and encouragement an extensive coast indent by capacious bay noble river inland sea with a country productive of every material for ship building and every commodity for gainful commerce and fill with a population active intelligent well inform and fearless of danger these advantage be not neglect and an impulse have lately be give to commercial enterprise which fill our ship yard with new construction encourage all the art and branch of industry connect with they crowd the wharf of our city with vessel and cover the most distant sea with our canvas let we be grateful for these blessing to the beneficent being who have confer they and who suffer we to indulge a reasonable hope of their continuance and extension while we neglect not the mean by which they may be preserve if we may dare to judge of his future design by the manner in which his past favor have be bestow he have make our national prosperity to depend on the preservation of our liberty our national force on our federal union and our individual happiness on the maintenance of our state right and wise institution if we be prosperous at home and respect abroad it be because we be free united industrious and obedient to the law while we continue so we shall by the blessing of heaven go on in the happy career we have begin and which have bring we in the short period of our political existence from a population of 3,000,000 to 13,000,000 from 13 separate colony to 24 united states from weakness to strength from a rank scarcely mark in the scale of nation to a high place in their respect this last advantage be one that have result in a great degree from the principle which have guide our intercourse with foreign power since we have assume an equal station among they and hence the annual account which the executive render to the country of the manner in which that branch of his duty have be fulfil prove instructive and salutary the pacific and wise policy of our government keep we in a state of neutrality during the war that have at different period since our political existence be carry on by other power but this policy while it give activity and extent to our commerce expose it in the same proportion to injury from the belligerent nation hence have arise claim of indemnity for those injury england france spain holland sweden denmark naples and lately portugal have all in a great or less degree infringe our neutral right demand for reparation be make upon all they have have in all and continue to have in some case a lead influence on the nature of our relation with the power on whom they be make of the claim upon england it be unnecessary to speak far than to say that the state of thing to which their prosecution and denial give rise have be succeed by arrangement productive of mutual good feeling and amicable relation between the two country which it be hope will not be interrupt one of these arrangement be that relate to the colonial trade which be communicate to congress at the last session and although the short period during which it have be in force will not enable i to form an accurate judgment of its operation there be every reason to believe that it will prove highly beneficial the trade thereby authorize have employ to 1831 09 30 upward of 30,000 ton of american and 15,000 ton of foreign shipping in the outward voyage and in the inward nearly an equal amount of american and 20,000 only of foreign tonnage advantage too have result to our agricultural interest from the state of the trade between canada and our territory and state border or the st. lawrence and the lake which may prove more than equivalent to the loss sustain by the discrimination make to favor the trade of the northern colony with the west indies after our transition from the state of colony to that of an independent nation many point be find necessary to be settle between we and great britain among they be the demarcation of boundary not describe with sufficient precision in the treaty of peace some of the line that divide the state and territory of the united states from the british province have be definitively fix that however which separate we from the province of canada and new brunswick to the north and the east be still in dispute when i come into office but i find arrangement make for its settlement over which i have no control the commissioner who have be appoint under the provision of the treaty of ghent having be unable to agree a convention be make with great britain by my immediate predecessor in office with the advice and consent of the senate by which it be agree that the point of difference which have arise in the settlement of the boundary line between the american and british dominion as describe in the fifth article of the treaty of ghent shall be refer as therein provide to some friendly sovereign or state who shall be invite to investigate and make a decision upon such point of difference and the king of the netherlands have by the late president and his britannic majesty been designate as such friendly sovereign it become my duty to carry with good faith the agreement so make into full effect to this end i cause all the measure to be take which be necessary to a full exposition of our case to the sovereign arbiter and nominate as minister plenipotentiary to his court a distinguished citizen of the state most interested in the question and who have be one of the agent previously employ for settle the controversy on 1831 01 10 his majesty the king of the netherlands deliver to the plenipotentiary of the united states and of great britain his write opinion on the case refer to he the paper in relation to the subject will be communicate by a special message to the proper branch of the government with the perfect confidence that its wisdom will adopt such measure as will secure an amicable settlement of the controversy without infringe any constitutional right of the state immediately interested it afford i satisfaction to inform you that suggestion make by my direction to the charg d'affaire of his britannic majesty to this government have have their desire effect in produce the release of certain american citizen who be imprison for set up the authority of the state of maine at a place in the dispute territory under the actual jurisdiction of his britannic majesty from this and the assurance i have receive of the desire of the local authority to avoid any cause of collision i have the good hope that a good understanding will be keep up until it be confirm by the final disposition of the subject the amicable relation which now subsist between the united states and great britain the increase intercourse between their citizen and the rapid obliteration of unfriendly prejudice to which former event naturally give rise concur to present this as a fit period for renew our endeavor to provide against the recurrence of cause of irritation which in the event of war between great britain and any other power would inevitably endanger our peace animate by the sincere desire to avoid such a state of thing and peacefully to secure under all possible circumstance the right and honor of the country i have give such instruction to the minister lately send to the court of london as will evince that desire and if meet by a correspondent disposition which we can not doubt will put an end to cause of collision which without advantage to either tend to estrange from each other two nation who have every motive to preserve not only peace but an intercourse of the most amicable nature in my message at the opening of the last session of congress i express a confident hope that the justice of our claim upon france urge as they be with perseverance and signal ability by our minister there would finally be acknowledge this hope have be realize a treaty have be sign which will immediately be lay before the senate for its approbation and which contain stipulation that require legislative act must have the concurrence of both house before it can be carry into effect by it the french government engage to pay a sum which if not quite equal to that which may be find due to our citizen will yet it be believe under all circumstance be deem satisfactory by those interested the offer of a gross sum instead of the satisfaction of each individual claim be accept because the only alternative be a rigorous exaction of the whole amount state to be due on each claim which might in some instance be exaggerate by design in other overrate through error and which therefore it would have be both ungracious and unjust to have insist on or a settlement by a mixed commission to which the french negotiator be very averse and which experience in other case have shew to be dilatory and often wholly inadequate to the end a comparatively small sum be stipulate on our part to go to the extinction of all claim by french citizen on our government and a reduction of duty on our cotton and their wine have be agree on as a consideration for the renunciation of an important claim for commercial privilege under the construction they give to the treaty for the cession of louisiana should this treaty receive the proper sanction a source of irritation will be stop that have for so many year in some degree alienate from each other two nation who from interest as well as the remembrance of early association ought to cherish the most friendly relation an encouragement will be give for perseverance in the demand of justice by this new proof that if steadily pursue they will be listen to and admonition will be offer to those power if any which may be incline to evade they that they will never be abandon above all a just confidence will be inspire in our fellow citizen that their government will exert all the power with which they have invest it in support of their just claim upon foreign nation at the same time that the frank acknowledgment and provision for the payment of those which be address to our equity although unsupported by legal proof afford a practical illustration of our submission to the divine rule of do to other what we desire they should do unto we sweden and denmark having make compensation for the irregularity commit by their vessel or in their port to the perfect satisfaction of the party concern and having renew the treaty of commerce enter into with they our political and commercial relation with those power continue to be on the most friendly footing with spain our difference up to 1819 02 22 be settle by the treaty of washington of that date but at a subsequent period our commerce with the state formerly colony of spain on the continent of america be annoy and frequently interrupt by her public and private armed ship they capture many of our vessel prosecute a lawful commerce and sell they and their cargo and at one time to our demand for restoration and indemnity oppose the allegation that they be take in the violation of a blockade of all the port of those state this blockade be declaratory only and the inadequacy of the force to maintain it be so manifest that this allegation be varied to a charge of trade in contraband of war this in its turn be also find untenable and the minister whom i send with instruction to press for the reparation that be due to our injure fellow citizen have transmit an answer to his demand by which the capture be declare to have be legal and be justify because the independence of the state of america never having be acknowledge by spain she have a right to prohibit trade with they under her old colonial law this ground of defense be contradictory not only to those which have be formerly allege but to the uniform practice and establish law of nation and have be abandon by spain herself in the convention which grant indemnity to british subject for capture make at the same time under the same circumstance and for the same allegation with those of which we complain i however indulge the hope that further reflection will lead to other view and feel confident that when his catholic majesty shall be convince of the justice of the claim his desire to preserve friendly relation between the two country which it be my earnest endeavor to maintain will induce he to accede to our demand i have therefore dispatch a special messenger with instruction to our minister to bring the case once more to his consideration to the end that if which i can not bring myself to believe the same decision that can not but be deem an unfriendly denial of justice should be persist in the matter may before your adjournment be lay before you the constitutional judge of what be proper to be do when negotiation for redress of injury fail the conclusion of a treaty for indemnity with france seem to present a favorable opportunity to renew our claim of a similar nature on other power and particularly in the case of those upon naples more especially as in the course of former negotiation with that power our failure to induce france to render we justice be use as an argument against we the desire of the merchant who be the principal sufferer have therefore be accede to and a mission have be institute for the special purpose of obtain for they a reparation already too long delay this measure having be resolve on it be put in execution without wait for the meeting of congress because the state of europe create an apprehension of event that might have render our application ineffectual our demand upon the government of the two sicily be of a peculiar nature the injury on which they be found be not deny nor be the atrocity and perfidy under which those injury be perpetrate attempt to be extenuate the sole ground on which indemnity have be refuse be the alleged illegality of the tenure by which the monarch who make the seizure hold his crown this defense always unfounded in any principle of the law of nation now universally abandon even by those power upon whom the responsibility for the act of past ruler bear the most heavily will unquestionably be give up by his sicilian majesty whose counsel will receive an impulse from that high sense of honor and regard to justice which be say to characterize he and i feel the full confidence that the talent of the citizen commission for that purpose will place before he the just claim of our injured citizen in such as light as will enable i before your adjournment to announce that they have be adjust and secure precise instruction to the effect of bring the negotiation to a speedy issue have be give and will be obey in the late blockade of terceira some of the portuguese fleet capture several of our vessel and commit other excess for which reparation be demand and i be on the point of dispatch an armed force to prevent any recurrence of a similar violence and protect our citizen in the prosecution of their lawful commerce when official assurance on which i rely make the sailing of the ship unnecessary since that period frequent promise have be make that full indemnity shall be give for the injury inflict and the loss sustain in the performance there have be some perhaps unavoidable delay but i have the full confidence that my earnest desire that this business may at once be close which our minister have be instruct strongly to express will very soon be gratify i have the well ground for this hope from the evidence of a friendly disposition which that government have show an actual reduction in the duty on rice the produce of our southern state authorize the anticipation that this important article of our export will soon be admit on the same footing with that produce by the most favored nation with the other power of europe we have fortunately have no cause of discussion for the redress of injury with the empire of the russias our political connection be of the most friendly and our commercial of the most liberal kind we enjoy the advantage of navigation and trade give to the most favored nation but it have not yet suit their policy or perhaps have not be find convenient from other consideration to give stability and reciprocity to those privilege by a commercial treaty the ill health of the minister last year charge with make a proposition for that arrangement do not permit he to remain at st. petersburg and the attention of that government during the whole of the period since his departure having be occupy by the war in which it be engage we have be assure that nothing could have be effect by his presence a minister will soon be nominate as well to effect this important object as to keep up the relation of amity and good understanding of which we have receive so many assurance and proof from his imperial majesty and the emperor his predecessor the treaty with austria be open to we an important trade with the hereditary dominion of the emperor the value of which have be hitherto little know and of course not sufficiently appreciate while our commerce find an entrance into the south of germany by mean of this treaty those we have form with the hanseatic town and prussia and other now in negotiation will open that vast country to the enterprise spirit of our merchant on the north&mdash;a country abound in all the material for a mutually beneficial commerce fill with enlightened and industrious inhabitant hold an important place in the politic of europe and to which we owe so many valuable citizen the ratification of the treaty with the porte be send to be exchange by the gentleman appoint our charge d'affaires to that court some difficulty occur on his arrival but at the date of his last official dispatch he suppose they have be obviate and that there be every prospect of the exchange be speedily effect this finish the connected view i have think it proper to give of our political and commercial relation in europe every effort in my power will be continue to strengthen and extend they by treaty found on principle of the most perfect reciprocity of interest neither ask nor concede any exclusive advantage but liberate as far as it lie in my power the activity and industry of our fellow citizen from the shackle which foreign restriction may impose to china and the east indies our commerce continue in its usual extent and with increase facility which the credit and capital of our merchant afford by substitute bill for payment in specie a daring outrage having be commit in those sea by the plunder of one of our merchant man engage in the pepper trade at a port in sumatra and the piratical perpetrator belong to tribe in such a state of society that the usual course of proceeding between civilized nation could not be pursue i forthwith dispatch a frigate with order to require immediate satisfaction for the injury and indemnity to the sufferer few change have take place in our connection with the independent state of america since my last communication to congress the ratification of a commercial treaty with the united republics of mexico have be for some time under deliberation in their congress but be still undecided at the date of our last dispatch the unhappy civil commotion that have prevail there be undoubtedly the cause of the delay but as the government be now say to be tranquillize we may hope soon to receive the ratification of the treaty and an arrangement for the demarcation of the boundary between we in the mean time an important trade have be open with mutual benefit from st. louis in the state of missouri by caravan to the interior province of mexico this commerce be protect in its progress through the indian country by the troop of the united states which have be permit to escort the caravans beyond our boundary to the settle part of the mexican territory from central america i have receive assurance of the most friendly kind and a gratifying application for our good office to remove a suppose indisposition toward that government in a neighboring state this application be immediately and successfully comply with they give we also the pleasing intelligence that difference which have prevail in their internal affair have be peaceably adjust our treaty with this republic continue to be faithfully observe and promise a great and beneficial commerce between the two countries&mdash;a commerce of the great importance if the magnificent project of a ship canal through the dominion of that state from the atlantic to the pacific ocean now in serious contemplation shall be execute i have great satisfaction in communicate the success which have attend the exertion of our minister in colombia to procure a very considerable reduction in the duty on our flour in that republic indemnity also have be stipulate for injury receive by our merchant from illegal seizure and renew assurance be give that the treaty between the two country shall be faithfully observe chili and peru seem to be still threaten with civil commotion and until they shall be settle disorder may naturally be apprehend require the constant presence of a naval force in the pacific ocean to protect our fishery and guard our commerce the disturbance that take place in the empire of brazil previously to and immediately consequent upon the abdication of the late emperor necessarily suspend any effectual application for the redress of some past injury suffer by our citizen from that government while they have be the cause of other in which all foreigner seem to have participate instruction have be give to our minister there to press for indemnity due for loss occasion by these irregularity and to take care of our fellow citizen shall enjoy all the privilege stipulate in their favor by the treaty lately make between the two power all which the good intelligence that prevail between our minister at rio janeiro and the regency give we the good reason to expect i should have place buenos aires in the list of south american power in respect to which nothing of importance affect we be to be communicate but for occurrence which have lately take place at the falkland islands in which the name of that republic have be use to cover with a show of authority act injurious to our commerce and to the property and liberty of our fellow citizen in the course of the present year one of our vessel engage in the pursuit of a trade which we have always enjoy without molestation have be capture by a band acting as they pretend under the authority of the government of buenos aires i have therefore give order for the dispatch of an armed vessel to join our squadron in those sea and aid in afford all lawful protection to our trade which shall be necessary and shall without delay send a minister to inquire into the nature of the circumstance and also of the claim if any that be set up by that government to those island in the mean time i submit the case to the consideration of congress to the end that they may clothe the executive with such authority and mean as they may deem necessary for provide a force adequate to the complete protection of our fellow citizen fish and trading in those sea this rapid sketch of our foreign relation it be hope fellow citizen may be of some use in so much of your legislation as may bear on that important subject while it afford to the country at large a source of high gratification in the contemplation of our political and commercial connection with the rest of the world at peace with all have subject of future difference with few and those susceptible of easy adjustment extend our commerce gradually on all side and on none by any but the most liberal and mutually beneficial mean we may by the blessing of providence hope for all that national prosperity which can be derive from an intercourse with foreign nation guide by those eternal principle of justice and reciprocal good will which be bind as well upon state as the individual of whom they be compose i have great satisfaction in make this statement of our affair because the course of our national policy enable i to do it without any indiscreet exposure of what in other government be usually conceal from the people have none but a straight forward open course to pursue guide by a single principle that will bear the strong light we have happily no political combination to form no alliance to entangle we no complicated interest to consult and in subject all we have do to the consideration of our citizen and to the inspection of the world we give no advantage to other nation and lie ourselves open to no injury it may not be improper to add that to preserve this state of thing and give confidence to the world in the integrity of our design all our consular and diplomatic agent be strictly enjoin to examine well every cause of complaint prefer by our citizen and while they urge with proper earnestness those that be well found to countenance none that be unreasonable or unjust and to enjoin on our merchant and navigator the strict obedience to the law of the country to which they resort and a course of conduct in their dealing that may support the character of our nation and render we respect abroad connect with this subject i must recommend a revisal of our consular law defect and omission have be discover in their operation that ought to be remedie and supply for your further information on this subject i have direct a report to be make by the secretary of state which i shall hereafter submit to your consideration the internal peace and security of our confederated state be the next principal object of the general government time and experience have prove that the abode of the native indian within their limit be dangerous to their peace and injurious to himself in accordance with my recommendation at a former session of congress an appropriation of $ 500,000 be make to aid the voluntary removal of the various tribe beyond the limit of the state at the last session i have the happiness to announce that the chickasaws and choctaws have accept the generous offer of the government and agree to remove beyond the mississippi river by which the whole of the state of mississippi and the western part of alabama will be free from indian occupancy and open to a civilized population the treaty with these tribe be in a course of execution and their removal it be hope will be complete in the course of 1832.at the request of the authority of georgia the registration of cherokee indians for emigration have be resume and it be confidently expect that half if not two third of that tribe will follow the wise example of their more westerly brother those who prefer remain at their present home will hereafter be govern by the law of georgia as all her citizen be and cease to be the object of peculiar care on the part of the general government during the present year the attention of the government have be particularly direct to those tribe in the powerful and grow state of ohio where considerable tract of the fine land be still occupy by the aboriginal proprietor treaty either absolute or conditional have be make extinguish the whole indian title to the reservation in that state and the time be not distant it be hope when ohio will be no long embarrassed with the indian population the same measure will be extend to indiana as soon as there be reason to anticipate success it be confidently believe that perseverance for a few year in the present policy of the government will extinguish the indian title to all land lie within the state compose our federal union and remove beyond their limit every indian who be not willing to submit to their law thus will all conflict claim to jurisdiction between the state and the indian tribe be put to rest it be pleasing to reflect that result so beneficial not only to the state immediately concern but to the harmony of the union will have be accomplish by measure equally advantageous to the indians what the native savage become when surround by a dense population and by mix with the white may be see in the miserable remnant of a few eastern tribe deprive of political and civil right forbid to make contract and subject to guardian drag out a wretched existence without excitement without hope and almost without thought but the removal of the indians beyond the limit and jurisdiction of the state do not place they beyond the reach of philanthropic aid and christian instruction on the contrary those whom philanthropy or religion may induce to live among they in their new abode will be more free in the exercise of their benevolent function than if they have remain within the limit of the state embarrass by their internal regulation now subject to no control but the superintend agency of the general government exercise with the sole view of preserve peace they may proceed unmolested in the interesting experiment of gradually advance a community of american indians from barbarism to the habit and enjoyment of civilized life among the happy effect of the improved relation of our republic have be an increase of trade produce a corresponding increase of revenue beyond the most sanguine anticipation of the treasury department the state of the public finance will be fully show by the secretary of the treasury in the report which he will presently lay before you i will here however congratulate you upon their prosperous condition the revenue receive in the present year will not fall short of $ 27,700,000 and the expenditure for all object other than the public debt will not exceed $ 14,700,000 the payment on account of the principal and interest of the debt during the year will exceed $ 16,500,000 a great sum than have be apply to that object out of the revenue in any year since the enlargement of the sink fund except the two year follow immediately there after the amount which will have be apply to the public debt from 1829 03 04 to 1832 01 01 which be less than three year since the administration have be place in my hand will exceed $ 40,000,000.from the large importation of the present year it may be safely estimate that the revenue which will be receive into the treasury from that source during the next year with the aid of that receive from the public land will considerably exceed the amount of the receipt of the present year and it be believe that with the mean which the government will have at its disposal from various source which will be fully state by the proper department the whole of the public debt may be extinguish either by redemption or purchase within the four year of my administration we shall then exhibit the rare example of a great nation abound in all the mean of happiness and security altogether free from debt the confidence with which the extinguishment of the public debt may be anticipate present an opportunity for carry into effect more fully the policy in relation to import duty which have be recommend in my former message a modification of the tariff which shall produce a reduction of our revenue to the want of the government and an adjustment of the duty on import with a view to equal justice in relation to all our national interest and to the counteraction of foreign policy so far as it may be injurious to those interest be deem to be one of the principal object which demand the consideration of the present congress justice to the interest of the merchant as well as the manufacturer require that material reduction in the import duty be prospective and unless the present congress shall dispose of the subject the propose reduction can not properly be make to take effect at the period when the necessity for the revenue arise from present rate shall cease it be therefore desirable that arrangement be adopt at your present session to relieve the people from unnecessary taxation after the extinguishment of the public debt in the exercise of that spirit of concession and conciliation which have distinguish the friend of our union in all great emergency it be believe that this object may be effect without injury to any national interest in my annual message of 1829 12 i have the honor to recommend the adoption of a more liberal policy than that which then prevail toward unfortunate debtor to the government and i deem it my duty again to invite your attention to this subject actuate by similar view congress at their last session pass an act for the relief of certain insolvent debtor of the united states but the provision of that law have not be deem such as be adequate to that relief to this unfortunate class of our fellow citizen which may be safely extend to they the point in which the law appear to be defective will be particularly communicate by the secretary of the treasury and i take pleasure in recommend such an extension of its provision as will unfetter the enterprise of a valuable portion of our citizen and restore to they the mean of usefulness to themselves and the community while deliberate on this subject i would also recommend to your consideration the propriety of so modify the law for enforce the payment of debt due either to the public or to individual sue in the court of the united states as to restrict the imprisonment of the person to case of fraudulent concealment of property the personal liberty of the citizen seem too sacred to be hold as in many case it now be at the will of a creditor to whom he be willing to surrender all the mean he have of discharge his debt the report from the secretary of the war and navy departments and from the postmaster general which accompany this message present satisfactory view of the operation of the department respectively under their charge and suggest improvement which be worthy of and to which i invite the serious attention of congress certain defect and omission having be discover in the operation of the law respect patent they be point out in the accompany report from the secretary of state i have heretofore recommend amendment of the federal constitution give the election of president and vice president to the people and limit the service of the former to a single term so important do i consider these change in our fundamental law that i can not in accordance with my sense of duty omit to press they upon the consideration of a new congress for my view more at large as well in relation to these point as to the disqualification of member of congress to receive an office from a president in whose election they have have an official agency which i propose as a substitute i refer you to my former message our system of public account be extremely complicated and it be believe may be much improve much of the present machinery and a considerable portion of the expenditure of public money may be dispense with while great facility can be afford to the liquidation of claim upon the government and an examination into their justice and legality quite as efficient as the present secure with a view to a general reform in the system i recommend the subject to the attention of congress i deem it my duty again to call your attention to the condition of the district of columbia it be doubtless wise in the framer of our constitution to place the people of this district under the jurisdiction of the general government but to accomplish the object they have in view it be not necessary that this people should be deprive of all the privilege of self government independently of the difficulty of induce the representative of distant state to turn their attention to project of law which be not of the high interest to their constituent they be not individually nor in congress collectively well qualified to legislate over the local concern of this district consequently its interest be much neglect and the people be almost afraid to present their grievance lest a body in which they be not represent and which feel little sympathy in their local relation should in its attempt to make law for they do more harm than good govern by the law of the state whence they be sever the two shore of the potomac within the 10 mile square have different penal codes&mdash;not the present code of virginia and maryland but such as exist in those state at the time of the cession to the united states as congress will not form a new code and as the people of the district can not make one for themselves they be virtually under two government be it not just to allow they at least a delegate in congress if not a local legislature to make law for the district subject to the approval or rejection of congress i earnestly recommend the extension to they of every political right which their interest require and which may be compatible with the constitution the extension of the judiciary system of the united states be deem to be one of the duty of the government one fourth of the states in the union do not participate in the benefit of a circuit court to the state of indiana illinois missouri alabama mississippi and louisiana admit into the union since the present judicial system be organize only a district court have be allow if this be sufficient then the circuit court already exist in 18 state ought to be abolish if it be not sufficient the defect ought to be remedie and these state place on the same footing with the other member of the union it be on this condition and on this footing that they enter the union and they may demand circuit court as a matter not of concession but of right i trust that congress will not adjourn leave this anomaly in our system entertain the opinion heretofore express in relation to the bank of the united states as at present organize i feel it my duty in my former message frankly to disclose they in order that the attention of the legislature and the people should be seasonably direct to that important subject and that it might be consider and finally dispose of in a manner well calculate to promote the end of the constitution and subserve the public interest having thus conscientiously discharge a constitutional duty i deem it proper on this occasion without a more particular reference to the view of the subject then express to leave it for the present to the investigation of an enlightened people and their representative in conclusion permit i to invoke that power which superintend all government to infuse into your deliberation at this important crisis of our history a spirit of mutual forbearance and conciliation in that spirit be our union form and in that spirit must it be preserve
to the senate and house of representatives
 be more and more convinced that the destiny of the indians within the settle portion of the united states depend upon their entire and speedy migration to the country west of the mississippi set apart for their permanent residence i be anxious that all the arrangement necessary to the complete execution of the plan of removal and to the ultimate security and improvement of the indians should be make without further delay those who have already remove and be remove be sufficiently numerous to engage the serious attention of the government and it be due not less to they than to the obligation which the nation have assume that every reasonable step should be take to fulfill the expectation that have be hold out to they many of those who yet remain will no doubt within a short period become sensible that the course recommend be the only one which promise stability or improvement and it be to be hope that all of they will realize this truth and unite with their brother beyond the mississippi should they do so there would then be no question of jurisdiction to prevent the government from exercise such a general control over their affair as may be essential to their interest and safety should any of they however repel the offer of removal they be free to remain but they must remain with such privilege and disability as the respective states within whose jurisdiction they live may prescribe
 i transmit herewith a report from the secretary of war which present a general outline of the progress that have already be make in this work and of all that remain to be do it will be perceive that much information be yet necessary for the faithful performance of the duty of the government without which it will be impossible to provide for the execution of some of the exist stipulation or make those prudential arrangement upon which the final success of the whole movement so far as relate to the indians themselves must depend
 i recommend the subject to the attention of congress in the hope that the suggestion in this report may be find useful and that provision may be make for the appointment of the commissioner therein refer to and for vest they with such authority as may be necessary to the satisfactory performance of the important duty propose to be intrust to they

the bill to modify and continue the act entitle an act to incorporate the subscriber to the bank of the united states be present to i on the 4th july instant having consider it with that solemn regard to the principle of the constitution which the day be calculate to inspire and come to the conclusion that it ought not to become a law i herewith return it to the senate in which it originate with my objection   a bank of the united states be in many respect convenient for the government and useful to the people entertain this opinion and deeply impressed with the belief that some of the power and privilege possess by the exist bank be unauthorized by the constitution subversive of the right of the states and dangerous to the liberty of the people i feel it my duty at an early period of my administration to call the attention of congress to the practicability of organize an institution combine all its advantage and obviate these objection i sincerely regret that in the act before i i can perceive none of those modification of the bank charter which be necessary in my opinion to make it compatible with justice with sound policy or with the constitution of our country   the present corporate body denominate the president director and company of the bank of the united states will have exist at the time this act be intend to take effect twenty year it enjoy an exclusive privilege of banking under the authority of the general government a monopoly of its favor and support and as a necessary consequence almost a monopoly of the foreign and domestic exchange the power privilege and favor bestow upon it in the original charter by increase the value of the stock far above its par value operate as a gratuity of many million to the stockholder   an apology may be find for the failure to guard against this result in the consideration that the effect of the original act of incorporation could not be certainly foresee at the time of its passage the act before i propose another gratuity to the holder of the same stock and in many case to the same man of at least seven million more this donation find no apology in any uncertainty as to the effect of the act on all hand it be concede that its passage will increase at least 20 or 30 per cent more the market price of the stock subject to the payment of the annuity of $ 200,000 per year secure by the act thus add in a moment one fourth to its par value it be not our own citizen only who be to receive the bounty of our government more than eight million of the stock of this bank be hold by foreigner by this act the american republic propose virtually to make they a present of some million of dollar for these gratuity to foreigner and to some of our own opulent citizen the act secure no equivalent whatever they be the certain gain of the present stockholder under the operation of this act after make full allowance for the payment of the bonus   every monopoly and all exclusive privilege be grant at the expense of the public which ought to receive a fair equivalent the many million which this act propose to bestow on the stockholder of the exist bank must come directly or indirectly out of the earning of the american people it be due to they therefore if their government sell monopoly and exclusive privilege that they should at least exact for they as much as they be worth in open market the value of the monopoly in this case may be correctly ascertain the twenty eight million of stock would probably be at an advance of 50 per cent and command in market at least $ 42,000,000 subject to the payment of the present bonus the present value of the monopoly therefore be $ 17,000,000 and this the act propose to sell for three million payable in fifteen annual installment of $ 200,000 each   it be not conceivable how the present stockholder can have any claim to the special favor of the government the present corporation have enjoy its monopoly during the period stipulate in the original contract if we must have such a corporation why should not the government sell out the whole stock and thus secure to the people the full market value of the privilege grant why should not congress create and sell twenty eight million of stock incorporate the purchaser with all the power and privilege secure in this act and put the premium upon the sale into the treasury   but this act do not permit competition in the purchase of this monopoly it seem to be predicate on the erroneous idea that the present stockholder have a prescriptive right not only to the favor but to the bounty of government it appear that more than a fourth part of the stock be hold by foreigner and the residue be hold by a few hundred of our own citizen chiefly of the rich class for their benefit do this act exclude the whole american people from competition in the purchase of this monopoly and dispose of it for many million less than it be worth this seem the less excusable because some of our citizen not now stockholder petitioned that the door of competition might be open and offer to take a charter on term much more favorable to the government and country   but this proposition although make by man whose aggregate wealth be believe to be equal to all the private stock in the exist bank have be set aside and the bounty of our government be propose to be again bestow on the few who have be fortunate enough to secure the stock and at this moment wield the power of the exist institution i can not perceive the justice or policy of this course if our government must sell monopoly it would seem to be its duty to take nothing less than their full value and if gratuity must be make once in fifteen or twenty year let they not be bestow on the subject of a foreign government nor upon a designated and favor class of man in our own country it be but justice and good policy as far as the nature of the case will admit to confine our favor to our own fellow citizen and let each in his turn enjoy an opportunity to profit by our bounty in the bearing of the act before i upon these point i find ample reason why it should not become a law   it have be urge as an argument in favor of rechartere the present bank that the calling in its loan will produce great embarrassment and distress the time allow to close its concern be ample and if it have be well manage its pressure will be light and heavy only in case its management have be bad if therefore it shall produce distress the fault will be its own and it would furnish a reason against renew a power which have be so obviously abuse but will there ever be a time when this reason will be less powerful to acknowledge its force be to admit that the bank ought to be perpetual and as a consequence the present stockholder and those inherit their right as successor be establish a privileged order clothe both with great political power and enjoy immense pecuniary advantage from their connection with the government   the modification of the exist charter propose by this act be not such in my view as make it consistent with the right of the states or the liberty of the people the qualification of the right of the bank to hold real estate the limitation of its power to establish branch and the power reserve to congress to forbid the circulation of small note be restriction comparatively of little value or importance all the objectionable principle of the exist corporation and most of its odious feature be retain without alleviation   the fourth section provide that the note or bill of the say corporation although the same be on the face thereof respectively make payable at one place only shall nevertheless be receive by the say corporation at the bank or at any of the office of discount and deposit thereof if tender in liquidation or payment of any balance or balance due to say corporation or to such office of discount and deposit from any other incorporate bank this provision secure to the state bank a legal privilege in the bank of the united states which be withhold from all private citizen if a state bank in philadelphia owe the bank of the united states and have note issue by the st. louis branch it can pay the debt with those note but if a merchant mechanic or other private citizen be in like circumstance he can not by law pay his debt with those note but must sell they at a discount or send they to st. louis to be cash this boon concede to the state bank though not unjust in itself be most odious because it do not measure out equal justice to the high and the low the rich and the poor to the extent of its practical effect it be a bond of union among the banking establishment of the nation erect they into an interest separate from that of the people and its necessary tendency be to unite the bank of the united states and the state bank in any measure which may be think conducive to their common interest   the ninth section of the act recognize principle of bad tendency than any provision of the present charter   it enact that the cashier of the bank shall annually report to the secretary of the treasury the name of all stockholder who be not resident citizen of the united states and on the application of the treasurer of any state shall make out and transmit to such treasurer a list of stockholder reside in or citizen of such state with the amount of stock own by each although this provision take in connection with a decision of the supreme court surrender by its silence the right of the states to tax the banking institution create by this corporation under the name of branch throughout the union it be evidently intend to be construe as a concession of their right to tax that portion of the stock which may be hold by their own citizen and resident in this light if the act become a law it will be understand by the states who will probably proceed to levy a tax equal to that pay upon the stock of bank incorporate by themselves in some states that tax be now 1 per cent either on the capital or on the share and that may be assume as the amount which all citizen or resident stockholder would be tax under the operation of this act as it be only the stock hold in the states and not that employ within they which would be subject to taxation and as the name of foreign stockholder be not to be report to the treasurer of the states it be obvious that the stock hold by they will be exempt from this burden their annual profit will therefore be 1 per cent more than the citizen stockholder and as the annual dividend of the bank may be safely estimate at 7 per cent the stock will be worth 10 or 15 per cent more to foreigner than to citizen of the united states to appreciate the effect which this state of thing will produce we must take a brief review of the operation and present condition of the bank of the united states   by document submit to congress at the present session it appear that on the 1st of january 1832 of the twenty eight million of private stock in the corporation $ 8,405,500 be hold by foreigner mostly of great britain the amount of stock hold in the nine western and southwestern states be $ 140,200 and in the four southern states be $ 5,623,100 and in the middle and eastern states be about $ 13,522,000 the profit of the bank in 1831 as show in a statement to congress be about $ 3,455,598 of this there accrue in the nine western states about $ 1,640,048 in the four southern states about $ 352,507 and in the middle and eastern states about $ 1,463,041 as little stock be hold in the west it be obvious that the debt of the people in that section to the bank be principally a debt to the eastern and foreign stockholder that the interest they pay upon it be carry into the eastern states and into europe and that it be a burden upon their industry and a drain of their currency which no country can bear without inconvenience and occasional distress to meet this burden and equalize the exchange operation of the bank the amount of specie draw from those states through its branch within the last two year as show by its official report be about $ 6,000,000 more than half a million of this amount do not stop in the eastern states but pass on to europe to pay the dividend of the foreign stockholder in the principle of taxation recognize by this act the western states find no adequate compensation for this perpetual burden on their industry and drain of their currency the branch bank at mobile make last year $ 95,140 yet under the provision of this act the state of alabama can raise no revenue from these profitable operation because not a share of the stock be hold by any of her citizen mississippi and missouri be in the same condition in relation to the branch at natchez and st. louis and such in a great or less degree be the condition of every western state the tendency of the plan of taxation which this act propose will be to place the whole united states in the same relation to foreign country which the western states now bear to the eastern when by a tax on resident stockholder the stock of this bank be make worth 10 or 15 per cent more to foreigner than to resident most of it will inevitably leave the country   thus will this provision in its practical effect deprive the eastern as well as the southern and western states of the mean of raise a revenue from the extension of business and great profit of this institution it will make the american people debtor to alien in nearly the whole amount due to this bank and send across the atlantic from two to five million of specie every year to pay the bank dividend   in another of its bearing this provision be fraught with danger of the twenty five director of this bank five be choose by the government and twenty by the citizen stockholder from all voice in these election the foreign stockholder be exclude by the charter in proportion therefore as the stock be transfer to foreign holder the extent of suffrage in the choice of director be curtail already be almost a third of the stock in foreign hand and not represent in election it be constantly pass out of the country and this act will accelerate its departure the entire control of the institution would necessarily fall into the hand of a few citizen stockholder and the ease with which the object would be accomplish would be a temptation to design man to secure that control in their own hand by monopolize the remain stock there be danger that a president and director would then be able to elect themselves from year to year and without responsibility or control manage the whole concern of the bank during the existence of its charter it be easy to conceive that great evil to our country and its institution might flow from such a concentration of power in the hand of a few man irresponsible to the people   be there no danger to our liberty and independence in a bank that in its nature have so little to bind it to our country the president of the bank have tell we that most of the state bank exist by its forbearance should its influence become concenter as it may under the operation of such an act as this in the hand of a self elect directory whose interest be identify with those of the foreign stockholder will there not be cause to tremble for the purity of our election in peace and for the independence of our country in war their power would be great whenever they might choose to exert it but if this monopoly be regularly renew every fifteen or twenty year on term propose by themselves they might seldom in peace put forth their strength to influence election or control the affair of the nation but if any private citizen or public functionary should interpose to curtail its power or prevent a renewal of its privilege it can not be doubt that he would be make to feel its influence   should the stock of the bank principally pass into the hand of the subject of a foreign country and we should unfortunately become involved in a war with that country what would be our condition of the course which would be pursue by a bank almost wholly own by the subject of a foreign power and manage by those whose interest if not affection would run in the same direction there can be no doubt all its operation within would be in aid of the hostile fleet and army without control our currency receive our public money and hold thousand of our citizen in dependence it would be more formidable and dangerous than the naval and military power of the enemy   if we must have a bank with private stockholder every consideration of sound policy and every impulse of american feeling admonish that it should be purely american its stockholder should be compose exclusively of our own citizen who at least ought to be friendly to our government and willing to support it in time of difficulty and danger so abundant be domestic capital that competition in subscribe for the stock of local bank have recently lead almost to riot to a bank exclusively of american stockholder possess the power and privilege grant by this act subscription for $ 200,000,000 could be readily obtain instead of send abroad the stock of the bank in which the government must deposit its fund and on which it must rely to sustain its credit in time of emergency it would rather seem to be expedient to prohibit its sale to alien under penalty of absolute forfeiture   it be maintain by the advocate of the bank that its constitutionality in all its feature ought to be consider as settle by precedent and by the decision of the supreme court to this conclusion i can not assent mere precedent be a dangerous source of authority and should not be regard as decide question of constitutional power except where the acquiescence of the people and the states can be consider as well settle so far from this be the case on this subject an argument against the bank might be base on precedent one congress in 1791 decide in favor of a bank another in 1811 decide against it one congress in 1815 decide against a bank another in 1816 decide in its favor prior to the present congress therefore the precedent draw from that source be equal if we resort to the states the expression of legislative judicial and executive opinion against the bank have be probably to those in its favor as 4 to 1 there be nothing in precedent therefore which if its authority be admit ought to weigh in favor of the act before i   if the opinion of the supreme court cover the whole ground of this act it ought not to control the coordinate authority of this government the congress the executive and the court must each for itself be guide by its own opinion of the constitution each public officer who take an oath to support the constitution swear that he will support it as he understand it and not as it be understand by other it be as much the duty of the house of representatives of the senate and of the president to decide upon the constitutionality of any bill or resolution which may be present to they for passage or approval as it be of the supreme judge when it may be bring before they for judicial decision the opinion of the judge have no more authority over congress than the opinion of congress have over the judge and on that point the president be independent of both the authority of the supreme court must not therefore be permit to control the congress or the executive when act in their legislative capacity but to have only such influence as the force of their reasoning may deserve   but in the case rely upon the supreme court have not decide that all the feature of this corporation be compatible with the constitution it be true that the court have say that the law incorporate the bank be a constitutional exercise of power by congress but take into view the whole opinion of the court and the reasoning by which they have come to that conclusion i understand they to have decide that inasmuch as a bank be an appropriate mean for carry into effect the enumerate power of the general government therefore the law incorporate it be in accordance with that provision of the constitution which declare that congress shall have power to make all law which shall be necessary and proper for carry those power into execution having satisfy themselves that the word necessary in the constitution mean needful requisite essential conducive to and that a bank be a convenient a useful and essential instrument in the prosecution of the government 's fiscal operation they conclude that to use one must be within the discretion of congress and that the act to incorporate the bank of the united states be a law make in pursuance of the constitution but say they where the law be not prohibit and be really calculate to effect any of the object intrust to the government to undertake here to inquire into the degree of its necessity would be to pass the line which circumscribe the judicial department and to tread on legislative ground    the principle here affirm be that the degree of its necessity involve all the detail of a banking institution be a question exclusively for legislative consideration a bank be constitutional but it be the province of the legislature to determine whether this or that particular power privilege or exemption be necessary and proper to enable the bank to discharge its duty to the government and from their decision there be no appeal to the court of justice under the decision of the supreme court therefore it be the exclusive province of congress and the president to decide whether the particular feature of this act be necessary and proper in order to enable the bank to perform conveniently and efficiently the public duty assign to it as a fiscal agent and therefore constitutional or unnecessary and improper and therefore unconstitutional   without comment on the general principle affirm by the supreme court let we examine the detail of this act in accordance with the rule of legislative action which they have lay down it will be find that many of the power and privilege confer on it can not be suppose necessary for the purpose for which it be propose to be create and be not therefore mean necessary to attain the end in view and consequently not justify by the constitution   the original act of incorporation section 21 enact that no other bank shall be establish by any future law of the united states during the continuance of the corporation hereby create for which the faith of the united states be hereby pledge provide congress may renew exist charter for bank within the district of columbia not increase the capital thereof and may also establish any other bank or bank in say district with capital not exceed in the whole $ 6,000,000 if they shall deem it expedient this provision be continue in force by the act before i fifteen year from the 3d of march 1836   if congress possess the power to establish one bank they have power to establish more than one if in their opinion two or more bank have be necessary to facilitate the execution of the power delegate to they in the constitution if they possess the power to establish a second bank it be a power derive from the constitution to be exercise from time to time and at any time when the interest of the country or the emergency of the government might make it expedient it be possess by one congress as well as another and by all congress alike and alike at every session but the congress of 1816 have take it away from their successor for twenty year and the congress of 1832 propose to abolish it for fifteen year more it can not be necessary or proper for congress to barter away or divest themselves of any of the power vest in they by the constitution to be exercise for the public good it be not necessary to the efficiency of the bank nor be it proper in relation to themselves and their successor they may properly use the discretion vest in they but they may not limit the discretion of their successor this restriction on themselves and grant of a monopoly to the bank be therefore unconstitutional   in another point of view this provision be a palpable attempt to amend the constitution by an act of legislation the constitution declare that the congress shall have power to exercise exclusive legislation in all case whatsoever over the district of columbia its constitutional power therefore to establish bank in the district of columbia and increase their capital at will be unlimited and uncontrollable by any other power than that which give authority to the constitution yet this act declare that congress shall not increase the capital of exist bank nor create other bank with capital exceed in the whole $ 6,000,000 the constitution declare that congress shall have power to exercise exclusive legislation over this district in all case whatsoever and this act declare they shall not which be the supreme law of the land this provision can not be necessary or proper or constitutional unless the absurdity be admit that whenever it be necessary and proper in the opinion of congress they have a right to barter away one portion of the power vest in they by the constitution as a means of execute the rest   on two subject only do the constitution recognize in congress the power to grant exclusive privilege or monopoly it declare that congress shall have power to promote the progress of science and useful art by secure for limited time to author and inventor the exclusive right to their respective writing and discovery out of this express delegation of power have grow our law of patent and copyright as the constitution expressly delegate to congress the power to grant exclusive privilege in these case as the mean of execute the substantive power to promote the progress of science and useful art it be consistent with the fair rule of construction to conclude that such a power be not intend to be grant as a means of accomplish any other end on every other subject which come within the scope of congressional power there be an ever live discretion in the use of proper mean which can not be restrict or abolish without an amendment of the constitution every act of congress therefore which attempt by grant of monopoly or sale of exclusive privilege for a limited time or a time without limit to restrict or extinguish its own discretion in the choice of mean to execute its delegate power be equivalent to a legislative amendment of the constitution and palpably unconstitutional   this act authorize and encourage transfer of its stock to foreigner and grant they an exemption from all state and national taxation so far from be necessary and proper that the bank should possess this power to make it a safe and efficient agent of the government in its fiscal operation it be calculate to convert the bank of the united states into a foreign bank to impoverish our people in time of peace to disseminate a foreign influence through every section of the republic and in war to endanger our independence   the several states reserve the power at the formation of the constitution to regulate and control title and transfer of real property and most if not all of they have law disqualify alien from acquire or hold land within their limit but this act in disregard of the undoubted right of the states to prescribe such disqualification give to alien stockholder in this bank an interest and title as member of the corporation to all the real property it may acquire within any of the states of this union this privilege grant to alien be not necessary to enable the bank to perform its public duty nor in any sense proper because it be vitally subversive of the right of the states   the government of the united states have no constitutional power to purchase land within the states except for the erection of fort magazine arsenal dockyard and other needful building and even for these object only by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be by make themselves stockholder in the bank and grant to the corporation the power to purchase land for other purpose they assume a power not grant in the constitution and grant to other what they do not themselves possess it be not necessary to the receive safe keeping or transmission of the fund of the government that the bank should possess this power and it be not proper that congress should thus enlarge the power delegate to they in the constitution   the old bank of the united states possess a capital of only $ 11,000,000 which be find fully sufficient to enable it with dispatch and safety to perform all the function require of it by the government the capital of the present bank be $ 35,000,000 -at least twenty four more than experience have prove to be necessary to enable a bank to perform its public function the public debt which exist during the period of the old bank and on the establishment of the new have be nearly pay off and our revenue will soon be reduce this increase of capital be therefore not for public but for private purpose   the government be the only proper judge where its agent should reside and keep their office because it well know where their presence will be necessary it can not therefore be necessary or proper to authorize the bank to locate branch where it please to perform the public service without consult the government and contrary to its will the principle lay down by the supreme court concede than congress can not establish a bank for purpose of private speculation and gain but only as a means of execute the delegate power of the general government by the same principle a branch bank can not constitutionally be establish for other than public purpose the power which this act give to establish two branch in any state without the injunction or request of the government and for other than public purpose be not necessary to the due execution of the power delegate to congress   the bonus which be exact from the bank be a confession upon the face of the act that the power grant by it be great than be necessary to its character of a fiscal agent the government do not tax its officer and agent for the privilege of serve it the bonus of a million and a half require by the original charter and that of three million propose by this act be not exact for the privilege of give the necessary facility for transfer the public fund from place to place within the united states or the territories thereof and for distribute the same in payment of the public creditor without charge commission or claim allowance on account of the difference of exchange as require by the act of incorporation but for something more beneficial to the stockholder the original act declare that it the bonus be grant in consideration of the exclusive privilege and benefit confer by this act upon the said bank and the act before i declare it to be in consideration of the exclusive benefit and privilege continue by this act to the say corporation for fifteen year as aforesaid it be therefore for exclusive privilege and benefit confer for their own use and emolument and not for the advantage of the government that a bonus be exact these surplus power for which the bank be require to pay can not surely be necessary to make it the fiscal agent of the treasury if they be the exaction of a bonus for they would not be proper    it be maintain by some that the bank be a means of execute the constitutional power to coin money and regulate the value thereof congress have establish a mint to coin money and pass law to regulate the value thereof the money so coin with its value so regulated and such foreign coin as congress may adopt be the only currency know to the constitution but if they have other power to regulate the currency it be confer to be exercise by themselves and not to be transfer to a corporation if the bank be establish for that purpose with a charter unalterable without its consent congress have part with their power for a term of year during which the constitution be a dead letter it be neither necessary nor proper to transfer its legislative power to such a bank and therefore unconstitutional   by its silence consider in connection with the decision of the supreme court in the case of mcculloch against the state of maryland this act take from the states the power to tax a portion of the banking business carry on within their limit in subversion of one of the strong barrier which secure they against federal encroachment banking like farming manufacturing or any other occupation or profession be a business the right to follow which be not originally derive from the law every citizen and every company of citizen in all of our states possess the right until the state legislature deem it good policy to prohibit private banking by law if the prohibitory state law be now repeal every citizen would again possess the right the state bank be a qualified restoration of the right which have be take away by the law against banking guard by such provision and limitation as in the opinion of the state legislature the public interest require these corporation unless there be an exemption in their charter be like private banker and banking company subject to state taxation the manner in which these taxis shall be lay depend wholly on legislative discretion it may be upon the bank upon the stock upon the profit or in any other mode which the sovereign power shall will   upon the formation of the constitution the states guard their tax power with peculiar jealousy they surrender it only as it regard import and export in relation to every other object within their jurisdiction whether person property business or profession it be secure in as ample a manner as it be before possess all person though united states officer be liable to a poll tax by the states within which they reside the land of the united states be liable to the usual land tax except in the new states from whom agreement that they will not tax unsold land be exact when they be admit into the union horse wagon any beast or vehicle tool or property belong to private citizen though employ in the service of the united states be subject to state taxation every private business whether carry on by an officer of the general government or not whether it be mix with public concern or not even if it be carry on by the government of the united states itself separately or in partnership fall within the scope of the tax power of the state nothing come more fully within it than bank and the business of banking by whomsoever institute and carry on over this whole subject matter it be just as absolute unlimited and uncontrollable as if the constitution have never be adopt because in the formation of that instrument it be reserve without qualification   the principle be concede that the states can not rightfully tax the operation of the general government they can not tax the money of the government deposit in the state bank nor the agency of those bank in remit it but will any man maintain that their mere selection to perform this public service for the general government would exempt the state bank and their ordinary business from state taxation have the united states instead of establish a bank at philadelphia employ a private banker to keep and transmit their fund would it have deprive pennsylvania of the right to tax his bank and his usual banking operation it will not be pretend upon what principle then be the banking establishment of the bank of the united states and their usual banking operation to be exempt from taxation it be not their public agency or the deposit of the government which the states claim a right to tax but their bank and their banking power institute and exercise within state jurisdiction for their private emolument those power and privilege for which they pay a bonus and which the states tax in their own bank the exercise of these power within a state no matter by whom or under what authority whether by private citizen in their original right by corporate body create by the states by foreigner or the agent of foreign government locate within their limit form a legitimate object of state taxation from this and like source from the person property and business that be find reside locate or carry on under their jurisdiction must the states since the surrender of their right to raise a revenue from import and export draw all the money necessary for the support of their government and the maintenance of their independence there be no more appropriate subject of taxation than bank banking and bank stock and none to which the states ought more pertinaciously to cling   it can not be necessary to the character of the bank as a fiscal agent of the government that its private business should be exempt from that taxation to which all the state bank be liable nor can i conceive it proper that the substantive and most essential power reserve by the states shall be thus attack and annihilate as a means of execute the power delegate to the general government it may be safely assume that none of those sage who have an agency in form or adopt our constitution ever imagine that any portion of the tax power of the states not prohibit to they nor delegate to congress be to be sweep away and annihilate as a means of execute certain power delegate to congress   if our power over mean be so absolute that the supreme court will not call in question the constitutionality of an act of congress the subject of which be not prohibit and be really calculate to effect any of the object intrust to the government although as in the case before i it take away power expressly grant to congress and right scrupulously reserve to the states it become we to proceed in our legislation with the utmost caution though not directly our own power and the right of the states may be indirectly legislate away in the use of mean to execute substantive power we may not enact that congress shall not have the power of exclusive legislation over the district of columbia but we may pledge the faith of the united states that as a means of execute other power it shall not be exercise for twenty year or forever we may not pass an act prohibit the states to tax the banking business carry on within their limit but we may as a means of execute our power over other object place that business in the hand of our agent and then declare it exempt from state taxation in their hand thus may our own power and the right of the states which we can not directly curtail or invade be fritter away and extinguish in the use of mean employ by we to execute other power that a bank of the united states competent to all the duty which may be require by the government might be so organized as not to infringe on our own delegate power or the reserved right of the states i do not entertain a doubt have the executive be call upon to furnish the project of such an institution the duty would have be cheerfully perform in the absence of such a call it be obviously proper that he should confine himself to point out those prominent feature in the act present which in his opinion make it incompatible with the constitution and sound policy a general discussion will now take place elicit new light and settle important principle and a new congress elect in the midst of such discussion and furnish an equal representation of the people accord to the last census will bear to the capitol the verdict of public opinion and i doubt not bring this important question to a satisfactory result   under such circumstance the bank come forward and ask a renewal of its charter for a term of fifteen year upon condition which not only operate as a gratuity to the stockholder of many million of dollar but will sanction any abuse and legalize any encroachment   suspicion be entertain and charge be make of gross abuse and violation of its charter an investigation unwillingly concede and so restrict in time as necessarily to make it incomplete and unsatisfactory disclose enough to excite suspicion and alarm in the practice of the principal bank partially unveil in the absence of important witness and in numerous charge confidently make and as yet wholly uninvestigate there be enough to induce a majority of the committee of investigation a committee which be select from the most able and honorable member of the house of representatives to recommend a suspension of further action upon the bill and a prosecution of the inquiry as the charter have yet four year to run and as a renewal now be not necessary to the successful prosecution of its business it be to have be expect that the bank itself conscious of its purity and proud of its character would have withdraw its application for the present and demand the severe scrutiny into all its transaction in their decline to do so there seem to be an additional reason why the functionary of the government should proceed with less haste and more caution in the renewal of their monopoly   the bank be professedly establish as an agent of the executive branch of the government and its constitutionality be maintain on that ground neither upon the propriety of present action nor upon the provision of this act be the executive consult it have have no opportunity to say that it neither need nor want an agent clothe with such power and favor by such exemption there be nothing in its legitimate function which make it necessary or proper whatever interest or influence whether public or private have give birth to this act it can not be find either in the wish or necessity of the executive department by which present action be deem premature and the power confer upon its agent not only unnecessary but dangerous to the government and country   it be to be regret that the rich and powerful too often bend the act of government to their selfish purpose distinction in society will always exist under every just government equality of talent of education or of wealth can not be produce by human institution in the full enjoyment of the gift of heaven and the fruit of superior industry economy and virtue every man be equally entitle to protection by law but when the law undertake to add to these natural and just advantage artificial distinction to grant title gratuity and exclusive privilege to make the rich rich and the potent more powerful the humble member of society the farmer mechanic and laborer who have neither the time nor the mean of securing like favor to themselves have a right to complain of the injustice of their government there be no necessary evil in government its evil exist only in its abuse if it would confine itself to equal protection and as heaven do its rain shower its favor alike on the high and the low the rich and the poor it would be an unqualified blessing in the act before i there seem to be a wide and unnecessary departure from these just principle   nor be our government to be maintain or our union preserve by invasion of the right and power of the several states in thus attempt to make our general government strong we make it weak its true strength consist in leave individual and states as much as possible to themselves in make itself feel not in its power but in its beneficence not in its control but in its protection not in bind the states more closely to the center but leave each to move unobstructed in its proper orbit   experience should teach we wisdom most of the difficulty our government now encounter and most of the danger which impend over our union have spring from an abandonment of the legitimate object of government by our national legislation and the adoption of such principle as be embody in this act many of our rich man have not be content with equal protection and equal benefit but have beseech we to make they rich by act of congress by attempt to gratify their desire we have in the result of our legislation array section against section interest against interest and man against man in a fearful commotion which threaten to shake the foundation of our union it be time to pause in our career to review our principle and if possible revive that devoted patriotism and spirit of compromise which distinguish the sage of the revolution and the father of our union if we can not at once in justice to interest vest under improvident legislation make our government what it ought to be we can at least take a stand against all new grant of monopoly and exclusive privilege against any prostitution of our government to the advancement of the few at the expense of the many and in favor of compromise and gradual reform in our code of law and system of political economy   i have now do my duty to my country if sustain by my fellow citizen i shall be grateful and happy if not i shall find in the motive which impel i ample ground for contentment and peace in the difficulty which surround we and the danger which threaten our institution there be cause for neither dismay nor alarm for relief and deliverance let we firmly rely on that kind providence which i be sure watch with peculiar care over the destiny of our republic and on the intelligence and wisdom of our countryman through his abundant goodness and their patriotic devotion our liberty and union will be preserve

state in which they be when i last address you&mdash;a state of prosperity and peace the effect of a wise attention to the parting advice of the revered father of his country on this subject condense into a maxim for the use of posterity by one of his most distinguished successors&mdash;to cultivate free commerce and honest friendship with all nation but to make entangle alliance with none a strict adherence to this policy have keep we aloof from the perplexing question that now agitate the european world and have more than once deluge those country with blood should those scene unfortunately recur the party to the contest may count on a faithful performance of the duty incumbent on we as a neutral nation and our own citizen may equally rely on the firm assertion of their neutral right with the nation that be our early friend and ally in the infancy of our political existence the most friendly relation have subsist through the late revolution of its government and from the event of the last promise a permanent duration it have make an approximation in some of its political institution to our own and raise a monarch to the throne who preserve it be say a friendly recollection of the period during which he acquire among our citizen the high consideration that could then have be produce by his personal qualification alone our commerce with that nation be gradually assume a mutually beneficial character and the adjustment of the claim of our citizen have remove the only obstacle there be to an intercourse not only lucrative but productive of literary and scientific improvement from great britain i have the satisfaction to inform you that i continue to receive assurance of the most amicable disposition which have on my part on all proper occasion be promptly and sincerely reciprocate the attention of that government have latterly be so much engross by matter of a deeply interesting domestic character that we could not press upon it the renewal of negotiation which have be unfortunately break off by the unexpected recall of our minister who have commence they with some hope of success my great object be the settlement of question which though now dormant might here after be revive under circumstance that would endanger the good understanding which it be the interest of both party to preserve inviolate cement as it be by a community of language manner and social habit and by the high obligation we owe to our british ancestor for many of our most valuable institution and for that system of representative government which have enable we to preserve and improve they the question of our northeast boundary still remain unsettled in my last annual message i explain to you the situation in which i find that business on my come into office and the measure i think it my duty to pursue for assert the right of the united states before the sovereign who have be choose by my predecessor to determine the question and also the manner in which he have dispose of it a special message to the senate in their executive capacity afterwards bring before they to the question whether they would advise a submission to the opinion of the sovereign arbiter that body having consider the award as not obligatory and advise i to open a further negotiation the proposition be immediately make to the british government but the circumstance to which i have allude have hitherto prevent any answer be give to the overture early attention however have be promise to the subject and every effort on my part will be make for a satisfactory settlement of this question interesting to the union generally and particularly so to one of its member the claim of our citizen on spain be not yet acknowledge on a close investigation of they than appear to have heretofore take place it be discover that some of these demand however strong they might be upon the equity of that government be not such as could be make the subject of national interference and faithful to the principle of ask nothing but what be clearly right additional instruction have be send to modify our demand so as to embrace those only on which accord to the law of nation we have a strict right to insist an inevitable delay in procure the document necessary for this review of the merit of these claim retard this operation until an unfortunate malady which have afflict his catholic majesty prevent an examination of they be now for the first time present in an unexceptionable form it be confidently hope that the application will be successful i have the satisfaction to inform you that the application i direct to be make for the delivery of a part of the archive of florida which have be carry to the havannah have produce a royal order for their delivery and that measure have be take to procure its execution by the report of the secretary of state communicate to you on 1832 06 25 you be inform of the conditional reduction obtain by the minister of the united states at madrid of the duty on tonnage levy on american shipping in the port of spain the condition of that reduction having be comply with on our part by the act pass 1832 07 13 i have the satisfaction to inform you that our ship now pay no high nor other duty in the continental port of spain than be levy on their national vessel the demand against portugal for illegal capture in the blockade of terceira have be allow to the full amount of the account present by the claimant and payment be promise to be make in three installment the first of these have be pay the second although due have not at the date of our last advice be receive owe it be allege to embarrassment in the finance consequent on the civil war in which that nation be engage the payment stipulate by the convention with denmark have be punctually make and the amount be ready for distribution among the claimant as soon as the board now sit shall have perform their function i regret that by the last advice from our charge d'affaires at naples that government have still delay the satisfaction due to our citizen but at that date the effect of the last instruction be not know dispatch from thence be hourly expect and the result will be communicate to you without delay with the rest of europe our relation political and commercial remain unchanged negotiation be go on to put on a permanent basis the liberal system of commerce now carry on between we and the empire of russia the treaty conclude with austria be execute by his imperial majesty with the most perfect good faith and as we have no diplomatic agent at his court he personally inquire into and correct a proceeding of some of his subaltern officer to the injury of our consul in one of his port our treaty with the sublime porte be produce its expect effect on our commerce new market be open for our commodity and a more extensive range for the employment of our ship a slight augmentation of the duty on our commerce inconsistent with the spirit of the treaty have be impose but on the representation of our charge d'affaires it have be promptly withdraw and we now enjoy the trade and navigation of the black sea and of all the port belong to the turkish empire and asia on the most perfect equality with all foreign nation i wish earnestly that in announce to you the continuance of friendship and the increase of a profitable commercial intercourse with mexico with central america and the state of the south i could accompany it with the assurance that they all be bless with that internal tranquillity and foreign peace which their heroic devotion to the cause of their independence merit in mexico a sanguinary struggle be now carry on which have cause some embarrassment to our commerce but both party profess the most friendly disposition toward we to the termination of this contest we look for the establishment of that secure intercourse so necessary to nation whose territory be contiguous how important it will be to we we may calculate from the fact that even in this unfavorable state of thing our maritime commerce have increase and an internal trade by caravan from st. louis to santa fe under the protection of escort furnish by the government be carry on to great advantage and be daily increase the agent provide for by the treaty with this power to designate the boundary which it establish have be name on our part but one of the evil of the civil war now rage there have be that the appointment of those with whom they be to cooperate have not yet be announce to we the government of central america have expel from its territory the party which some time since disturb its peace desirous of foster a favorable disposition toward we which have on more than one occasion be evince by this interesting country i make a second attempt in this year to establish a diplomatic intercourse with they but the death of the distinguished citizen whom i have appoint for that purpose have retard the execution of measure from which i hope much advantage to our commerce the union of the three state which form the republic of colombia have be dissolve but they all it be believe consider themselves as separately bind by the treaty which be make in their federal capacity the minister accredit to the federation continue in that character near the government of new grenada and hope be entertain that a new union would be form between the separate states at least for the purpose of foreign intercourse our minister have be instruct to use his good office when ever they shall be desire to produce the reunion so much to be wish for the domestic tranquillity of the party and the security and facility of foreign commerce some agitation naturally attendant on an infant reign have prevail in the empire of brazil which have have the usual effect upon commercial operation and while they suspend the consideration of claim create on similar occasion they have give rise to new complaint on the part of our citizen a proper consideration for calamity and difficulty of this nature have make we less urgent and peremptory in our demand for justice than duty to our fellow citizen would under other circumstance have require but their claim be not neglect and will on all proper occasion be urge and it be hope with effect i refrain from make any communication on the subject of our affair with buenos aires because the negotiation communicate to you in my last annual message be at the date of our last advice still pende and in a state that would render a publication of the detail inexpedient a treaty of amity and commerce have be form with the republic of chile which if approve by the senate will be lay before you that government seem to be establish and at peace with its neighbor and its port be the resort of our ship which be employ in the highly important trade of the fishery this commercial convention can not but be of great advantage to our fellow citizen engage in that perilous but profitable business our commerce with the neighbor state of peru owe to the onerous duty levy on our principal article of export have be on the decline and all endeavor to procure an alteration have hitherto prove fruitless with bolivia we have yet no diplomatic intercourse and the continual contest carry on between it and peru have make i defer until a more favorable period the appointment of any agent for that purpose an act of atrocious piracy having be commit on one of our trading ship by the inhabitant of a settlement on the west coast of sumatra a frigate be dispatch with order to demand satisfaction for the injury if those who commit it should be find to be member of a regular government capable of maintain the usual relation with foreign nation but if as it be suppose and as they prove to be they be a band of lawless pirate to inflict such a chastisement as would deter they and other from like aggression this last be do and the effect have be an increase respect for our flag in those distant sea and additional security for our commerce in the view i have give of our connection with foreign power allusion have be make to their domestic disturbance or foreign war to their revolution or dissension it may be proper to observe that this be do solely in case where those event affect our political relation with they or to show their operation on our commerce far than this it be neither our policy nor our right to interfere our good wish on all occasion our good office when require will be afford to promote the domestic tranquillity and foreign peace of all nation with whom we have any intercourse any intervention in their affair far than this even by the expression of an official opinion be contrary to our principle of international policy and will always be avoid the report which the secretary of the treasury will in due time lie before you will exhibit the national finance in a highly prosperous state owe to the continued success of our commercial enterprise which have enable the merchant to fulfill their engagement with the government the receipt from custom during the year will exceed the estimate present at the last session and with the other mean of the treasury will prove fully adequate not only to meet the increase expenditure result from the large appropriation make by congress but to provide for the payment of all the public debt which be at present redeemable it be now estimate that the custom will yield to the treasury during the present year upward of $ 28,000,000 the public land however have prove less productive than be anticipate and accord to present information will not much exceed $ 2,000,000 the expenditure for all object other than the public debt be estimate to amount during the year to about $ 16,500,000 while a still large sum viz $ 18,000,000 will have be apply to the principal and interest of the public debt it be expect however that in consequence of the reduce rate of duty which will take effect after 1833 03 03 there will be a considerable fall off in the revenue from custom in the year 1833 it will never the less be amply sufficient to provide for all the want of the public service estimate even upon a liberal scale and for the redemption and purchase of the remainder of the public debt on 1833 01 01 the entire public debt of the united states fund and unfunded will be reduce to within a fraction of $ 7,000,000 of which $ 2,227,363 be not of right redeemable until 1834 01 01 and $ 4,735,296 not until 1835 01 02 the commissioner of the sink fund however be invest with full authority to purchase the debt at the market price and the mean of the treasury be ample it may be hope that the whole will be extinguish within the year 1833.i can not too cordially congratulate congress and my fellow citizen on the near approach of that memorable and happy event&mdash;the extinction of the public debt of this great and free nation faithful to the wise and patriotic policy mark out by the legislation of the country for this object the present administration have devote to it all the mean which a flourish commerce have supply and a prudent economy preserve for the public treasury within the four year for which the people have confide the executive power to my charge $ 58,000,000 will have be apply to the payment of the public debt that this have be accomplish without stint the expenditure for all other proper object will be see by refer to the liberal provision make during the same period for the support and increase of our mean of maritime and military defense for internal improvement of a national character for the removal and preservation of the indians and lastly for the gallant veteran of the revolution the final removal of this great burthen from our resource afford the mean of further provision for all the object of general welfare and public defense which the constitution authorize and present the occasion for such further reduction in the revenue as may not be require for they from the report of the secretary of the treasury it will be see that after the present year such a reduction may be make to a considerable extent and the subject be earnestly recommend to the consideration of congress in the hope that the combined wisdom of the representative of the people will devise such mean of effecting that salutary object as may remove those burthen which shall be find to fall unequally upon any and as may promote all the great interest of the community long and patient reflection have strengthen the opinion i have heretofore express to congress on this subject and i deem it my duty on the present occasion again to urge they upon the attention of the legislature the sound maxim of public policy and the principal upon which our republican institution be found recommend a proper adaptation of the revenue to the expenditure and they also require that the expenditure shall be limit to what by an economical administration shall be consistent with the simplicity of the government and necessary to an efficient public service in effecting this adjustment it be due in justice to the interest of the different state and even to the preservation of the union itself that the protection afford by exist law to any branch of the national industry should not exceed what may be necessary to counteract the regulation of foreign nation and to secure a supply of those article of manufacture essential to the national independence and safety in time of war if upon investigation it shall be find as it be believe it will be that the legislative protection grant to any particular interest be great than be indispensably requisite for these object i recommend that it be gradually diminish and that as far as may be consistent with these object the whole scheme of duty be reduce to the revenue standard as soon as a just regard to the faith of the government and to the preservation of the large capital invest in establishment of domestic industry will permit that manufacture adequate to the supply of our domestic consumption would in the abstract be beneficial to our country there be no reason to doubt and to effect their establishment there be perhaps no american citizen who would not for a while be willing to pay a high price for they but for this purpose it be presume that a tariff of high duty design for perpetual protection which they maintain have the effect to reduce the price by domestic competition below that of the foreign article experience however our good guide on this as on other subject make it doubtful whether the advantage of this system be not counter balanced by many evil and whether it do not tend to beget in the mind of a large portion of our countryman a spirit of discontent and jealousy dangerous to the stability of the union what then shall be do large interest have grow up under the imply pledge of our national legislation which it would seem a violation of public faith suddenly to abandon nothing could justify it but the public safety which be the supreme law but those who have vest their capital in manufacturing establishment can not expect that the people will continue permanently to pay high taxis for their benefit when the money be not require for any legitimate purpose in the administration of the government be it not enough that the high duty have be pay as long as the money arise from they could be apply to the common benefit in the extinguishment of the public debt those who take an enlarged view of the condition of our country must be satisfied that the policy of protection must be ultimately limit to those article of domestic manufacture which be indispensable to our safety in time of war within this scope on a reasonable scale it be recommend by every consideration of patriotism and duty which will doubtless always secure to it a liberal and efficient support but beyond this object we have already see the operation of the system productive of discontent in some section of the republic its influence be deprecate as tend to concentrate wealth into a few hand and as create those germ of dependence and vice which in other country have characterize the existence of monopoly and prove so destructive of liberty and the general good a large portion of the people in one section of the republic declare it not only inexpedient on these ground but as disturb the equal relation of property by legislation and therefore unconstitutional and unjust doubtless these effect be in a great degree exaggerated and may be ascribe to a mistaken view of the consideration which lead to the adoption of the tariff system but they be never the less important in enable we to review the subject with a more thorough knowledge of all its bearing upon the great interest of the republic and with a determination to dispose of it so that none can with justice complain it be my painful duty to state that in one quarter of the united states opposition to the revenue law have arise to a height which threaten to thwart their execution if not to endanger the integrity of the union what ever obstruction may be throw in the way of the judicial authority of the general government it be hope they will be able peaceably to overcome they by the prudence of their own officer and the patriotism of the people but should this reasonable reliance on the moderation and good sense of all portion of our fellow citizen be disappoint it be believe that the law themselves be fully adequate to the suppression of such attempt as may be immediately make should the exigency arise render the execution of the exist law impracticable from any cause what ever prompt notice of it will be give to congress with a suggestion of such view and measure as may be deem necessary to meet it in conformity with principle heretofore explain and with the hope of reduce the general government to that simple machine which the constitution create and of withdraw from the states all other influence than that of its universal beneficence in preserve peace afford an uniform currency maintain the inviolability of contract diffuse intelligence and discharge unfelt its other super intending function i recommend that provision be make to dispose of all stock now hold by it in corporation whether create by the general or state government and place the proceed in the treasury as a source of profit these stock be of little or no value as a means of influence among the state they be adverse to the purity of our institution the whole principle on which they be base be deem by many unconstitutional and to persist in the policy which they indicate be consider wholly inexpedient it be my duty to acquaint you with an arrangement make by the bank of the united states with a portion of the holder of the 3 percent stock by which the government will be deprive of the use of the public fund long than be anticipate by this arrangement which will be particularly explain by the secretary of the treasury a surrender of the certificate of this stock may be postpone until 1833 october and thus may be continue by the failure of the bank to perform its duty such measure as be within the reach of the secretary of the treasury have be take to enable he to judge whether the public deposit in that institution may be regard as entirely safe but as his limited power may prove inadequate to this object i recommend the subject to the attention of congress under the firm belief that it be worthy of their serious investigation an inquiry into the transaction of the institution embrace the branch as well as the principal bank seems call for by the credit which be give throughout the country to many serious charge impeach its character and which if true may justly excite the apprehension that it be no long a safe depository of the money of the people among the interest which merit the consideration of congress after the payment of the public debt one of the most important in my view be that of the public land previous to the formation of our present constitution it be recommend by congress that a portion of the waste land own by the state should be cede to the united states for the purpose of general harmony and as a fund to meet the expense of the war the recommendation be adopt and at different period of time the state of massachusetts new york virginia north and south carolina and georgia grant their vacant soil for the use for which they have be ask as the land may now be consider as relieve from this pledge it be in the discretion of congress to dispose of they in such way as good to conduce to the quiet harmony and general interest of the american people in examine this question all local and sectional feeling should be discard and the whole united states regard as one people interested alike in the prosperity of their common country it can not be doubt that the speedy settlement of these land constitute the true interest of the republic the wealth and strength of a country be its population and the good part of that population be cultivator of the soil independent farmer be every where the basis of society and true friend of liberty in addition to these consideration question have already arise and may be expect hereafter to grow out of the public land which involve the right of the new state and the power of the general government and unless a liberal policy be now adopt there be danger that these question may speedily assume an importance not now generally anticipate the influence of a great sectional interest when bring into full action will be find more dangerous to the harmony and union of the state than any other cause of discontent and it be the part of wisdom and sound policy to foresee its approach and endeavor if possible to counteract they of the various scheme which have be hitherto propose in regard to the disposal of the public land none have yet receive the entire approbation of the national legislature deeply impressed with the importance of a speedy and satisfactory arrangement of the subject i deem it my duty on this occasion to urge it upon your consideration and to the proposition which have be heretofore suggest by other to contribute those reflection which have occur to i in the hope that they may assist you in your future deliberation it seem to i to be our policy that the public land shall cease as soon as practicable to be a source of revenue and that they be sell to settler in limited parcel at a price barely sufficient to reimburse to the united states the expense of the present system and the cost arise under our indian compact the advantage of accurate survey and undoubted title now secure to purchaser seem to forbid the abolition of the present system because none can be substitute which will more perfectly accomplish these important end it be desirable however that in convenient time this machinery be withdraw from the state and that the right of soil and the future disposition of it be surrender to the state respectively in which it lie the adventurous and hardy population of the west besides contribute their equal share of taxation under our impost system have in the progress of our government for the land they occupy pay into the treasury a large proportion of $ 40,000,000 and of the revenue receive therefrom but a small part have be expend among they when to the disadvantage of their situation in this respect we add the consideration that it be their labor alone which give real value to the land and that the proceed arise from their sale be distribute chiefly among state which have not originally any claim to they and which have enjoy the undivided emolument arise from the sale of their own land it can not be expect that the new state will remain long content with the present policy after the payment of the public debt to avert the consequence which may be apprehend from this cause to pub an end for ever to all partial and interested legislation on the subject and to afford to every american citizen of enterprise the opportunity of secure an independent freehold it seem to i therefore well to abandon the idea of raise a future revenue out of the public land in former message i have express my conviction that the constitution do not warrant the application of the fund of the general government to object of internal improvement which be not national in their character and both as a means of do justice to all interest and put an end to a course of legislation calculate to destroy the purity of the government have urge the necessity of reduce the whole subject to some fixed and certain rule as there never will occur a period perhaps more propitious than the present to the accomplishment of this object i beg leave to press the subject again upon your attention without some general and well define principle ascertain those object of internal improvement to which the mean of the nation may be constitutionally apply it be obvious that the exercise of the power can never be satisfactory besides the danger to which it expose congress of make hasty appropriation to work of the character of which they may be frequently ignorant it promote a mischievous and corrupting influence upon election by hold out to the people the fallacious hope that the success of a certain candidate will make navigable their neighboring creek or river bring commerce to their door and increase the value of their property it thus favor combination to squander the treasure of the country upon a multitude of local object as fatal to just legislation as to the purity of public man if a system compatible with the constitution can not be devise which be free from such tendency we should recollect that that instrument provide within itself the mode of its amendment and that there be therefore no excuse for the assumption of doubtful power by the general government if those which be clearly grant shall be find incompetent to the end of its creation it can at any time apply for their enlargement and there be no probability that such an application if found on the public interest will ever be refuse if the propriety of the propose grant be not sufficiently apparent to command the assent of three fourth of the state the good possible reason why the power should not be assume on doubtful authority be afford for if more than one quarter of the state be unwilling to make the grant its exercise will be productive of discontent which will far over balance any advantage that could be derive from it all must admit that there be nothing so worthy of the constant solicitude of this government as the harmony and union of the people be solemnly impressed with the conviction that the extension of the power to make internal improvement beyond the limit i have suggest even if it be deem constitutional be subversive of the good interest of our country i earnestly recommend to congress to refrain from its exercise in doubtful case except in relation to improvement already begin unless they shall first procure from the state such an amendment of the constitution as will define its character and prescribe its bound if the state feel themselves competent to these object why should this government wish to assume the power if they do not then they will not hesitate to make the grant both government be the government of the people improvement must be make with the money of the people and if the money can be collect and apply by those more simple and economical political machine the state government it will unquestionably be safe and well for the people than to add to the splendor the patronage and the power of the general government but if the people of the several state think otherwise they will amend the constitution and in their decision all ought cheerfully to acquiesce for a detailed and highly satisfactory view of the operation of the war department i refer you to the accompany report of the secretary of war the hostile incursion of the sac and fox indians necessarily lead to the interposition of the government a portion of the troop under generals scott and atkinson and of the militia of the state of illinois be call into the field after a harass warfare prolong by the nature of the country and by the difficulty of procure subsistence the indians be entirely defeat and the disaffect band disperse or destroy the result have be creditable to the troop engage in the service severe as be the lesson to the indians it be render necessary by their unprovoked aggression and it be to be hope that its impression will be permanent and salutary this campaign have evince the efficient organization of the army and its capacity for prompt and active service its several department have perform their function with energy and dispatch and the general movement be satisfactory our fellow citizen upon the frontier be ready as they always be in the tender of their service in the hour of danger but a more efficient organization of our militia system be essential to that security which be one of the principal object of all government neither our situation nor our institution require or permit the maintenance of a large regular force history offer too many lesson of the fatal result of such a measure not to warn we against its adoption here the expense which attend it the obvious tendency to employ it because it exist and thus to engage in unnecessary war and its ultimate danger to public liberty will lead we i trust to place our principal dependence for protection upon the great body of the citizen of the republic if in assert right or in repelling wrong war should come upon we our regular force should be increase to an extent proportional to the emergency and our present small army be a nucleus around which such force could be form and embody but for the purpose of defense under ordinary circumstance we must rely upon the elector of the country those by whom and for whom the government be institute and be support will constitute its protection in the hour of danger as they do its check in the hour of safety but it be obvious that the militia system be imperfect much time be lose much unnecessary expense incur and much public property waste under the present arrangement little useful knowledge be gain by the muster and drill as now establish and the whole subject evidently require a thorough examination whether a plan of classification remedy these defect and provide for a system of instruction might not be adopt be submit to the consideration of congress the constitution have vest in the general government an independent authority upon the subject of the militia which render its action essential to the establishment or improvement of the system and i recommend the matter to your consideration in the conviction that the state of this important arm of the public defense require your attention i be happy to inform you that the wise and humane policy of transfer from the eastern to the western side of the mississippi the remnant of our aboriginal tribe with their own consent and upon just term have be steadily pursue and be approach i trust its consummation by reference to the report of the secretary of war and to the document submit with it you will see the progress which have be make since your last session in the arrangement of the various matter connect with our indian relation with one exception every subject involve any question of conflicting jurisdiction or of peculiar difficulty have be happily dispose of and the conviction evidently gain ground among the indians that their removal to the country assign by the united states for their permanent residence furnish the only hope of their ultimate prosperity with that portion of the cherokees however live within the state of georgia it have be find impracticable as yet to make a satisfactory adjustment such be my anxiety to remove all the ground of complaint and to bring to a termination the difficulty in which they be involve that i direct the very liberal proposition to be make to they which accompany the document herewith submit they can not but have see in these offer the evidence of the strong disposition on the part of the government to deal justly and liberally with they an ample indemnity be offer for their present possession a liberal provision for their future support and improvement and full security for their private and political right what ever difference of opinion may have prevail respect the just claim of these people there will probably be none respect the liberality of the proposition and very little respect the expediency of their immediate acceptance they be however reject and thus the position of these indians remain unchanged as do the view communicate in my message to the senate of 1831 02 22].i refer you to the annual report of the secretary of the navy which accompany this message for a detail of the operation of that branch of the service during the present year besides the general remark on some of the transaction of our navy present in the view which have be take of our foreign relation i seize this occasion to invite to your notice the increase protection which it have afford to our commerce and citizen on distant sea without any augmentation of the force in commission in the gradual improvement of its pecuniary concern in the constant progress in the collection of material suitable for use during future emergency and in the construction of vessel and the building necessary to their preservation and repair the present state of this branch of the service exhibit the fruit of that vigilance and care which be so indispensable to its efficiency various new suggestion contain in the annexed report as well as other heretofore to congress be worthy of your attention but none more so than that urge the renewal for another term of six year of the general appropriation for the gradual improvement of the navy from the accompanying report of the postmaster general you will also perceive that that department continue to extend its usefulness without impair its resource or lessen the accommodation which it afford in the secure and rapid transportation of the mail i beg leave to call the attention of congress to the view heretofore express in relation to the mode of choose the president and vice president of the united states and to those respect the tenure of office generally still impressed with the justness of those view and with the belief that the modification suggest on those subject if adopt will contribute to the prosperity and harmony of the country i earnestly recommend they to your consideration at this time i have heretofore point out defect in the law for punish official fraud especially within the district of columbia it have be find almost impossible to bring notorious culprit to punishment and accord to a decision of the court for this district a prosecution be bar by a lapse of two year after the fraud have be commit it may happen again as it have already happen that during the whole two year all the evidence of the fraud may be in the possession of the culprit himself however proper the limitation may be in relation to private citizen it would seem that it ought not to commence run in favor of public officer until they go out of office the judiciary system of the united states remain imperfect of the nine western and southwestern state three only enjoy the benefit of a circuit court ohio kentucky and tennessee be embrace in the general system but indiana illinois missouri alabama mississippi and louisiana have only district court if the exist system be a good one why should it not be extend if it be a bad one why be it suffer to exist the new state be promise equal right and privilege when they come into the union and such be the guaranty of the constitution nothing can be more obvious than the obligation of the general government to place all the state on the same footing in relation to the administration of justice and i trust this duty will be neglect no long on many of the subject to which your attention be invite in this communication it be a source of gratification to reflect that the step to be now adopt be uninfluence by the embarrassment entail upon the country by the war through which it have pass in regard to most of our great interest we may consider ourselves as just start in our career and after a salutary experience about to fix upon a permanent basis the policy well calculate to promote the happiness of the people and facilitate their progress toward the most complete enjoyment of civil liberty on an occasion so interesting and important in our history and of such anxious concern to the friend of freedom throughout the world it be our imperious duty to lay aside all selfish and local consideration and be guide by a lofty spirit of devotion to the great principle on which our institution be found that this government may be so administer as to preserve its efficiency in promote and secure these general object should be the only aim of our ambition and we can not therefore too carefully examine its structure in order that we may not mistake its power or assume those which the people have reserve to themselves or have prefer to assign to other agent we should bear constantly in mind the fact that the consideration which induce the framer of the constitution to withhold from the general government the power to regulate the great mass of the business and concern of the people have be fully justify by experience and that it can not now be doubt that the genius of all our institution prescribe simplicity and economy as the characteristic of the reform which be yet to be effect in the present and future execution of the function bestow upon we by the constitution limit to a general superintend power to maintain peace at home and abroad and to prescribe law on a few subject of general interest not calculate to restrict human liberty but to enforce human right this government will find its strength and its glory in the faithful discharge of these plain and simple duty relieve by its protect shield from the fear of war and the apprehension of oppression the free enterprise of our citizen aid by the state sovereignty will work out improvement and amelioration which can not fail to demonstrate that the great truth that the people can govern themselves be not only realize in our example but that it be do by a machinery in government so simple and economical as scarcely to be feel that the almighty ruler of the universe may so direct our deliberation and overrule our act as to make we instrumental in secure a result so dear to mankind be my most earnest and sincere prayer
~~to the house of representatives
 in addition to the general view i have heretofore express to congress on the subject of internal improvement it be my duty to advert to it again in state my objection to the bill entitle an act for the improvement of certain harbor and the navigation of certain river which be not receive a sufficient time before the close of the last session to enable i to examine it before the adjournment
 having maturely consider that bill within the time allow i by the constitution and be convince that some of its provision conflict with the rule adopt for my guide on this subject of legislation i have be compel to withhold from it my signature and it have therefore fail to become a law
 to facilitate as far as i can the intelligent action of congress upon the subject embrace in this bill i transmit herewith a report from the engineer department distinguish as far as the information within its possession would enable it between those appropriation which do and those which do not conflict with the rule by which my conduct in this respect have hitherto be govern by that report it will be see that there be a class of appropriation in the bill for the improvement of stream that be not navigable that be not channel of commerce and that do not pertain to the harbor or port of entry designate by law or have any ascertained connection with the usual establishment for the security of commerce external or internal
 it be obvious that such appropriation involve the sanction of a principle that concede to the general government an unlimited power over the subject of internal improvement and that i could not therefore approve a bill contain they without recede from the position take in my veto of the maysville road bill and afterwards in my annual message of december 6 1830
 it be to be regret that the rule by which the classification of the improvement in this bill have be make by the engineer department be not more definite and certain and that embarrassment may not always be avoid by the observance of they but as neither my own reflection nor the light derive from other source have furnish i with a well guide i shall continue to apply my good exertion to their application and enforcement in thus employ my good faculty to exercise the power with which i be invest to avoid evil and to effect the great attainable good for our common country i feel that i may trust to your cordial cooperation and the experience of the past leave i no room to doubt the liberal indulgence and favorable consideration of those for whom we act
 the ground upon which i have give my assent to appropriation for the construction of lighthouse beacon buoy public pier and the removal of sand bar sawyer and other temporary or partial impediment in our navigable river and harbor and with which many of the provision of this bill correspond have be so fully state that i trust a repetition of they be unnecessary have there be incorporate in the bill no provision for work of a different description depend on principle which extend the power of make appropriation to every object which the discretion of the government may select and lose sight of the distinction between national and local character which i have state would be my future guide on the subject i should have cheerfully sign the bill

 whereas a convention assemble in the state of south carolina have pass an ordinance by which they declare that the several act and part of act of the congress of the united states purport to be law for the imposing of duty and impost on the importation of foreign commodity and now have actual operation and effect within the united states and more especially two act for the same purpose pass on the 29th of may 1828 and on the 14th of july 1832 be unauthorized by the constitution of the united states and violate the true meaning and intent thereof and be null and void and no law nor bind on the citizen of that state or its officer and by the said ordinance it be far declare to be unlawful for any of the constituted authority of the state or of the united states to enforce the payment of the duty impose by the say act within the same state and that it be the duty of the legislature to pass such law as may be necessary to give full effect to the said ordinance and
 whereas by the say ordinance it be far ordain that in no case of law or equity decide in the court of say state wherein shall be draw in question the validity of the said ordinance or of the act of the legislature that may be pass to give it effect or of the say law of the united states no appeal shall be allow to the supreme court of the united states nor shall any copy of the record be permit or allow for that purpose and that any person attempt to take such appeal shall be punish as for contempt of court and finally the say ordinance declare that the people of south carolina will maintain the say ordinance at every hazard and that they will consider the passage of any act by congress abolish or close the port of the say state or otherwise obstruct the free ingress or egress of vessel to and from the say port or any other act of the federal government to coerce the state shut up her port destroy or harass her commerce or to enforce the say act otherwise than through the civil tribunal of the country as inconsistent with the long continuance of south carolina in the union and that the people of the say state will thenceforth hold themselves absolve from all further obligation to maintain or preserve their political connection with the people of the other states and will forthwith proceed to organize a separate government and do all other act and thing which sovereign and independent state may of right do and
 whereas the say ordinance prescribe to the people of south carolina a course of conduct in direct violation of their duty as citizen of the united states contrary to the law of their country subversive of its constitution and have for its object the destruction of the union-- that union which coeval with our political existence lead our father without any other tie to unite they than those of patriotism and a common cause through a sanguinary struggle to a glorious independence that sacred union hitherto inviolate which perfect by our happy constitution have bring we by the favor of heaven to a state of prosperity at home and high consideration abroad rarely if ever equal in the history of nation
 to preserve this bond of our political existence from destruction to maintain inviolate this state of national honor and prosperity and to justify the confidence my fellow citizen have repose in i i andrew jackson president of the united states have think proper to issue this my proclamation state my view of the constitution and law applicable to the measure adopt by the convention of south carolina and to the reason they have put forth to sustain they declare the course which duty will require i to pursue and appeal to the understanding and patriotism of the people warn they of the consequence that must inevitably result from an observance of the dictate of the convention
 strict duty would require of i nothing more than the exercise of those power with which i be now or may hereafter be invest for preserve the peace of the union and for the execution of the law but the impose aspect which opposition have assume in this case by clothing itself with state authority and the deep interest which the people of the united states must all feel in prevent a resort to strong measure while there be a hope that anything will be yield to reasoning and remonstrance perhaps demand and will certainly justify a full exposition to south carolina and the nation of the view i entertain of this important question as well as a distinct enunciation of the course which my sense of duty will require i to pursue
 the ordinance be found not on the indefensible right of resist act which be plainly unconstitutional and too oppressive to be endure but on the strange position that any one state may not only declare an act of congress void but prohibit its execution that they may do this consistently with the constitution that the true construction of that instrument permit a state to retain its place in the union and yet be bind by no other of its law than those it may choose to consider as constitutional it be true they add that to justify this abrogation of a law it must be palpably contrary to the constitution but it be evident that to give the right of resist law of that description couple with the uncontrolled right to decide what law deserve that character be to give the power of resist all law for as by the theory there be no appeal the reason allege by the state good or bad must prevail if it should be say that public opinion be a sufficient check against the abuse of this power it may be ask why it be not deem a sufficient guard against the passage of an unconstitutional act by congress there be however a restraint in this last case which make the assumed power of a state more indefensible and which do not exist in the other there be two appeal from an unconstitutional act pass by congress one to the judiciary the other to the people and the states there be no appeal from the state decision in theory and the practical illustration show that the court be close against an application to review it both judge and juror be swear to decide in its favor but reasoning on this subject be superfluous when our social compact in express term declare that the law of the united states its constitution and treaty make under it be the supreme law of the land and for great caution add that the judge in every state shall be bind thereby anything in the constitution or law of any state to the contrary notwithstanding and it may be assert without fear of refutation that no federative government could exist without a similar provision look for a moment to the consequence if south carolina consider the revenue law unconstitutional and have a right to prevent their execution in the port of charleston there would be a clear constitutional objection to their collection in every other port and no revenue could be collect anywhere for all impost must be equal it be no answer to repeat that an unconstitutional law be no law so long as the question of its legality be to be decide by the state itself for every law operate injuriously upon any local interest will be perhaps think and certainly represent as unconstitutional and as have be show there be no appeal
 if this doctrine have be establish at an early day the union would have be dissolve in its infancy the excise law in pennsylvania the embargo and nonintercourse law in the eastern states the carriage tax in virginia be all deem unconstitutional and be more unequal in their operation than any of the law now complain of but fortunately none of those states discover that they have the right now claim by south carolina the war into which we be force to support the dignity of the nation and the right of our citizen might have end in defeat and disgrace instead of victory and honor if the states who suppose it a ruinous and unconstitutional measure have think they possess the right of nullify the act by which it be declare and deny supply for its prosecution hardly and unequally as those measure bear upon several member of the union to the legislature of none do this efficient and peaceable remedy as it be call suggest itself the discovery of this important feature in our constitution be reserve to the present day to the statesman of south carolina belong the invention and upon the citizen of that state will unfortunately fall the evil of reduce it to practice
 if the doctrine of a state veto upon the law of the union carry with it internal evidence of its impracticable absurdity our constitutional history will also afford abundant proof that it would have be repudiate with indignation have it be propose to form a feature in our government
 in our colonial state although dependent on another power we very early consider ourselves as connect by common interest with each other league be form for common defense and before the declaration of independence we be know in our aggregate character as the united colonies of america that decisive and important step be take jointly we declare ourselves a nation by a joint not by several act and when the term of our confederation be reduce to form it be in that of a solemn league of several states by which they agree that they would collectively form one nation for the purpose of conduct some certain domestic concern and all foreign relation in the instrument form that union be find an article which declare that every state shall abide by the determination of congress on all question which by that confederation should be submit to they
 under the confederation then no state could legally annul a decision of the congress or refuse to submit to its execution but no provision be make to enforce these decision congress make requisition but they be not comply with the government could not operate on individual they have no judiciary no mean of collect revenue
 but the defect of the confederation need not be detail under its operation we could scarcely be call a nation we have neither prosperity at home nor consideration abroad this state of thing could not be endure and our present happy constitution be form but form in vain if this fatal doctrine prevail it be form for important object that be announce in the preamble make in the name and by the authority of the people of the united states whose delegate frame and whose convention approve it the most important among these object that which be place first in rank on which all the other rest be to form a more perfect union now be it possible that even if there be no express provision give supremacy to the constitution and law of the united states over those of the states can it be conceive that an instrument make for the purpose of form a more perfect union than that of the confederation could be so construct by the assemble wisdom of our country as to substitute for that confederation a form of government dependent for its existence on the local interest the party spirit of a state or of a prevail faction in a state every man of plain unsophisticated understanding who hear the question will give such an answer as will preserve the union metaphysical subtlety in pursuit of an impracticable theory could alone have devise one that be calculate to destroy it
 i consider then the power to annul a law of the united states assume by one state incompatible with the existence of the union contradict expressly by the letter of the constitution unauthorized by its spirit inconsistent with every principle on which it be found and destructive of the great object far which it be form
 after this general view of the lead principle we must examine the particular application of it which be make in the ordinance
 the preamble rest its justification on these ground it assume as a fact that the obnoxious law although they purport to be law for raise revenue be in reality intend for the protection of manufacture which purpose it assert to be unconstitutional that the operation of these law be unequal that the amount raise by they be great than be require by the want of the government and finally that the proceed be to be apply to object unauthorized by the constitution these be the only cause allege to justify an open opposition to the law of the country and a threat of secede from the union if any attempt should be make to enforce they the first virtually acknowledge that the law in question be pass under a power expressly give by the constitution to lay and collect impost but its constitutionality be draw in question from the motive of those who pass it however apparent this purpose may be in the present case nothing can be more dangerous than to admit the position that an unconstitutional purpose entertain by the member who assent to a law enact under a constitutional power shall make that law void for how be that purpose to be ascertain who be to make the scrutiny how often may bad purpose be falsely impute in how many case be they conceal by false profession in how many be no declaration of motive make admit this doctrine and you give to the states an uncontrolled right to decide and every law may be annul under this pretext if therefore the absurd and dangerous doctrine should be admit that a state may annul an unconstitutional law or one that it deem such it will not apply to the present case
 the next objection be that the law in question operate unequally this objection may be make with truth to every law that have be or can be pass the wisdom of man never yet contrive a system of taxation that would operate with perfect equality if the unequal operation of a law make it unconstitutional and if all law of that description may be abrogate by any state for that cause then indeed be the federal constitution unworthy of the slight effort for its preservation we have hitherto rely on it as the perpetual bond of our union we have receive it as the work of the assemble wisdom of the nation we have trust to it as to the sheet anchor of our safety in the stormy time of conflict with a foreign or domestic foe we have look to it with sacred awe as the palladium of our liberty and with all the solemnity of religion have pledge to each other our life and fortune here and our hope of happiness hereafter in its defense and support be we mistaken my countryman in attach this importance to the constitution of our country be our devotion pay to the wretched inefficient clumsy contrivance which this new doctrine would make it do we pledge ourselves to the support of an airy nothing a bubble that must be blow away by the first breath of disaffection be this self destroy visionary theory the work of the profound statesman the exalted patriot to whom the task of constitutional reform be intrust do the name of washington sanction do the states deliberately ratify such an anomaly in the history of fundamental legislation no we be not mistaken the letter of this great instrument be free from this radical fault its language directly contradict the imputation its spirit its evident intent contradict it no we do not err our constitution do not contain the absurdity of give power to make law and another to resist they the sage whose memory will always be reverence have give we a practical and as they hope a permanent constitutional compact the father of his country do not affix his revere name to so palpable an absurdity nor do the states when they severally ratify it do so under the impression that a veto on the law of the united states be reserve to they or that they could exercise it by implication search the debate in all their convention examine the speech of the most zealous opposer of federal authority look at the amendment that be propose they be all silent not a syllable utter not a vote give not a motion make to correct the explicit supremacy give to the law of the union over those of the states or to show that implication as be now contend could defeat it no we have not err the constitution be still the object of our reverence the bond of our union our defense in danger the source of our prosperity in peace it shall descend as we have receive it uncorrupted by sophistical construction to our posterity and the sacrifice of local interest of state prejudice of personal animosity that be make to bring it into existence will again be patriotically offer for its support
 the two remain objection make by the ordinance to these law be that the sum intend to be raise by they be great than be require and that the proceed will be unconstitutionally employ
 the constitution have give expressly to congress the right of raise revenue and of determine the sum the public exigency will require the states have no control over the exercise of this right other than that which result from the power of change the representative who abuse it and thus procure redress congress may undoubtedly abuse this discretionary power but the same may be say of other with which they be vested yet the discretion must exist somewhere the constitution have give it to the representative of all the people check by the representative of the states and by the executive power the south carolina construction give it to the legislature or the convention of a single state where neither the people of the different states nor the states in their separate capacity nor the chief magistrate elect by the people have any representation which be the most discreet disposition of the power i do not ask you fellow citizen which be the constitutional disposition that instrument speak a language not to be misunderstood but if you be assemble in general convention which would you think the safe depository of this discretionary power in the last resort would you add a clause give it to each of the states or would you sanction the wise provision already make by your constitution if this should be the result of your deliberation when provide for the future be you can you be ready to risk all that we hold dear to establish for a temporary and a local purpose that which you must acknowledge to be destructive and even absurd as a general provision carry out the consequence of this right vest in the different states and you must perceive that the crisis your conduct present at this day would recur whenever any law of the united states displease any of the states and that we should soon cease to be a nation
 the ordinance with the same knowledge of the future that characterize a former objection tell you that the proceed of the tax will be unconstitutionally apply if this could be ascertain with certainty the objection would with more propriety be reserve for the law so apply the proceed but surely can not be urge against the law levy the duty
 these be the allegation contain in the ordinance examine they seriously my fellow citizen judge for yourself i appeal to you to determine whether they be so clear so convincing as to leave no doubt of their correctness and even if you should come to this conclusion how far they justify the reckless destructive course which you be direct to pursue review these objection and the conclusion draw from they once more what be they every law then for raise revenue accord to the south carolina ordinance may be rightfully annul unless it be so framed as no law ever will or can be frame congress have a right to pass law for raise revenue and each state have a right to oppose their execution two right directly oppose to each other and yet be this absurdity suppose to be contain in an instrument draw for the express purpose of avoid collision between the states and the general government by an assembly of the most enlightened statesman and pure patriot ever embody for a similar purpose
 in vain have these sage declare that congress shall have power to lay and collect taxis duty impost and excise in vain have they provide that they shall have power to pass law which shall be necessary and proper to carry those power into execution that those law and that constitution shall be the supreme law of the land and that the judge in every state shall be bind thereby anything in the constitution or law of any state to the contrary notwithstanding in vain have the people of the several states solemnly sanction these provision make they their paramount law and individually swear to support they whenever they be call on to execute any office vain provision ineffectual restriction vile profanation of oath miserable mockery of legislation if a bare majority of the voter in any one state may on a real or suppose knowledge of the intent with which a law have be pass declare themselves free from its operation say here it give too little there too much and operate unequally here it suffer article to be free that ought to be tax there it tax those that ought to be free in this case the proceed be intend to be apply to purpose which we do not approve in that the amount raise be more than be want congress it be true be invest by the constitution with the right of decide these question accord to their sound discretion congress be compose of the representative of all the states and of all the people of all the states but we part of the people of one state to whom the constitution have give no power on the subject from whom it have expressly take it away we who have solemnly agree that this constitution shall be our law we most of whom have swear to support it we now abrogate this law and swear and force other to swear that it shall not be obey and we do this not because congress have no right to pass such law this we do not allege but because they have pass they with improper view they be unconstitutional from the motive of those who pass they which we can never with certainty know from their unequal operation although it be impossible from the nature of thing that they should be equal and from the disposition which we presume may be make of their proceed although that disposition have not be declare this be the plain meaning of the ordinance in relation to law which it abrogate for alleged unconstitutionality but it do not stop there it repeal in express term an important part of the constitution itself and of law pass to give it effect which have never be allege to be unconstitutional
 the constitution declare that the judicial power of the united states extend to case arise under the law of the united states and that such law the constitution and treaty shall be paramount to the state constitution and law the judiciary act prescribe the mode by which the case may be bring before a court of the united states by appeal when a state tribunal shall decide against this provision of the constitution the ordinance declare there shall be no appeal make the state law paramount to the constitution and law of the united states force judge and juror to swear that they will disregard their provision and even make it penal in a suitor to attempt relief by appeal it far declare that it shall not be lawful for the authority of the united states or of that state to enforce the payment of duty impose by the revenue law within its limit
 here be a law of the united states not even pretend to be unconstitutional repeal by the authority of a small majority of the voter of a single state here be a provision of the constitution which be solemnly abrogate by the same authority
 on such exposition and reasoning the ordinance ground not only an assertion of the right to annul the law of which it complain but to enforce it by a threat of secede from the union if any attempt be make to execute they
 this right to secede be deduce from the nature of the constitution which they say be a compact between sovereign states who have preserve their whole sovereignty and therefore be subject to no superior that because they make the compact they can break it when in their opinion it have be depart from by the other states fallacious as this course of reasoning be it enlist state pride and find advocate in the honest prejudice of those who have not study the nature of our government sufficiently to see the radical error on which it rest
 the people of the united states form the constitution act through the state legislature in make the compact to meet and discuss its provision and act in separate convention when they ratify those provision but the term use in its construction show it to be a government in which the people of all the states collectively be represent we be one people in the choice of president and vice president here the states have no other agency than to direct the mode in which the vote shall be give the candidate have the majority of all the vote be choose the elector of a majority of states may have give their vote for one candidate and yet another may be choose the people then and not the states be represent in the executive branch
 in the house of representatives there be this difference that the people of one state do not as in the case of president and vice president all vote for the same officer the people of all the states do not vote for all the member each state elect only its own representative but this create no material distinction when choose they be all representative of the united states not representative of the particular state from which they come they be pay by the united states not by the state nor be they accountable to it for any act do in the performance of their legislative function and however they may in practice as it be their duty to do consult and prefer the interest of their particular constituent when they come in conflict with any other partial or local interest yet it be their first and high duty as representative of the united states to promote the general good
 the constitution of the united states then form a government not a league and whether it be form by compact between the states or in any other manner its character be the same it be a government in which all the people be represent which operate directly on the people individually not upon the states they retain all the power they do not grant but each state having expressly part with so many power as to constitute jointly with the other states a single nation can not from that period possess any right to secede because such secession do not break a league but destroy the unity of a nation and any injury to that unity be not only a breach which would result from the contravention of a compact but it be an offense against the whole union to say that any state may at pleasure secede from the union be to say that the united states be not a nation because it would be a solecism to contend that any part of a nation might dissolve its connection with the other part to their injury or ruin without commit any offense secession like any other revolutionary act may be morally justify by the extremity of oppression but to call it a constitutional right be confound the meaning of term and can only be do through gross error or to deceive those who be willing to assert a right but would pause before they make a revolution or incur the penalty consequent on a failure
 because the union be form by a compact it be say the party to that compact may when they feel themselves aggrieve depart from it but it be precisely because it be a compact that they can not a compact be an agreement or binding obligation it may by its term have a sanction or penalty for its breach or it may not if it contain no sanction it may be break with no other consequence than moral guilt if it have a sanction then the breach incur the designated or implied penalty a league between independent nation generally have no sanction other than a moral one or if it should contain a penalty as there be no common superior it can not be enforce a government on the contrary always have a sanction express or imply and in our case it be both necessarily imply and expressly give an attempt by force of arm to destroy a government be an offense by whatever mean the constitutional compact may have be form and such government have the right by the law of self defense to pass act for punish the offender unless that right be modify restrain or resume by the constitutional act in our system although it be modify in the case of treason yet authority be expressly give to pass all law necessary to carry its power into effect and under this grant provision have be make for punish act which obstruct the due administration of the law
 it would seem superfluous to add anything to show the nature of that union which connect we but as erroneous opinion on this subject be the foundation of doctrine the most destructive to our peace i must give some further development to my view on this subject no one fellow citizen have a high reverence for the reserved right of the states than the magistrate who now address you no one would make great personal sacrifice or official exertion to defend they from violation but equal care must be take to prevent on their part an improper interference with or resumption of the right they have vest in the nation the line have not be so distinctly draw as to avoid doubt in some case of the exercise of power man of the good intention and sound view may differ in their construction of some part of the constitution but there be other on which dispassionate reflection can leave no doubt of this nature appear to be the assumed right of secession it rest as we have see on the allege undivided sovereignty of the states and on their having form in this sovereign capacity a compact which be call the constitution from which because they make it they have the right to secede both of these position be erroneous and some of the argument to prove they so have be anticipate
 the states severally have not retain their entire sovereignty it have be show that in become part of a nation not member of a league they surrender many of their essential part of sovereignty the right to make treaty declare war levy taxis exercise exclusive judicial and legislative power be all of they function of sovereign power the states then for all these important purpose be no long sovereign the allegiance of their citizen be transfer in the first instance to the government of the united states they become american citizen and owe obedience to the constitution of the united states and to law make in conformity with the power it vest in congress this last position have not be and can not be deny how then can that state be say to be sovereign and independent whose citizen owe obedience to law not make by it and whose magistrate be swear to disregard those law when they come in conflict with those pass by another what show conclusively that the states can not be say to have reserve an undivided sovereignty be that they expressly cede the right to punish treason not treason against their separate power but treason against the united states treason be an offense against sovereignty and sovereignty must reside with the power to punish it but the reserved right of the states be not less sacred because they have for their common interest make the general government the depository of these power the unity of our political character as have be show for another purpose commence with its very existence under the royal government we have no separate character our opposition to its oppression begin as united colony we be the united states under the confederation and the name be perpetuate and the union render more perfect by the federal constitution in none of these stage do we consider ourselves in any other light than as form one nation treaty and alliance be make in the name of all troop be raise for the joint defense how then with all these proof that under all change of our position we have for designate purpose and with define power create national government how be it that the most perfect of those several mode of union should now be consider as a mere league that may be dissolve at pleasure it be from an abuse of term compact be use as synonymous with league although the true term be not employ because it would at once show the fallacy of the reasoning it would not do to say that our constitution be only a league but it be labor to prove it a compact which in one sense it be and then to argue that as a league be a compact every compact between nation must of course be a league and that from such an engagement every sovereign power have a right to recede but it have be show that in this sense the states be not sovereign and that even if they be and the national constitution have be form by compact there would be no right in any one state to exonerate itself from its obligation
 so obvious be the reason which forbid this secession that it be necessary only to allude to they the union be form for the benefit of all it be produce by mutual sacrifice of interest and opinion can those sacrifice be recall can the states who magnanimously surrender their title to the territory of the west recall the grant will the inhabitant of the inland states agree to pay the duty that may be impose without their assent by those on the atlantic or the gulf for their own benefit shall there be a free port in one state and onerous duty in another no one believe that any right exist in a single state to involve all the other in these and countless other evil contrary to engagement solemnly make everyone must see that the other states in self defense must oppose it at all hazard
 these be the alternative that be present by the convention a repeal of all the act for raise revenue leave the government without the mean of support or an acquiescence in the dissolution of our union by the secession of one of its member when the first be propose it be know that it could not be listen to for a moment it be know if force be apply to oppose the execution of the law that it must be repel by force that congress could not without involve itself in disgrace and the country in ruin accede to the proposition and yet if this be not do in a give day or if any attempt be make to execute the law the state be by the ordinance declare to be out of the union the majority of a convention assemble for the purpose have dictate these term or rather this rejection of all term in the name of the people of south carolina it be true that the governor of the state speak of the submission of their grievance to a convention of all the states which he say they sincerely and anxiously seek and desire yet this obvious and constitutional mode of obtain the sense of the other states on the construction of the federal compact and amend it if necessary have never be attempt by those who have urge the state on to this destructive measure the state might have propose the call for a general convention to the other states and congress if a sufficient number of they concur must have call it but the first magistrate of south carolina when he express a hope that on a review by congress and the functionary of the general government of the merit of the controversy such a convention will be accord to they must have know that neither congress nor any functionary of the general government have authority to call such a convention unless it be demand by two third of the states this suggestion then be another instance of the reckless inattention to the provision of the constitution with which this crisis have be madly hurry on or of the attempt to persuade the people that a constitutional remedy have be seek and refuse if the legislature of south carolina anxiously desire a general convention to consider their complaint why have they not make application for it in the way the constitution point out the assertion that they earnestly seek it be completely negative by the omission
 this then be the position in which we stand a small majority of the citizen of one state in the union have elect delegate to a state convention that convention have ordain that all the revenue law of the united states must be repeal or that they be no long a member of the union the governor of that state have recommend to the legislature the raising of an army to carry the secession into effect and that he may be empower to give clearance to vessel in the name of the state no act of violent opposition to the law have yet be commit but such a state of thing be hourly apprehend and it be the intent of this instrument to proclaim not only that the duty impose on i by the constitution to take care that the law be faithfully execute shall be perform to the extent of the power already vest in i by law or of such other as the wisdom of congress shall devise and intrust to i for that purpose but to warn the citizen of south carolina who have be delude into an opposition to the law of the danger they will incur by obedience to the illegal and disorganize ordinance of the convention to exhort those who have refuse to support it to persevere in their determination to uphold the constitution and law of their country and to point out to all the perilous situation into which the good people of that state have be lead and that the course they be urge to pursue be one of ruin and disgrace to the very state whose right they affect to support
 fellow citizen of my native state let i not only admonish you as the first magistrate of our common country not to incur the penalty of its law but use the influence that a father would over his child whom he saw rush to certain ruin in that paternal language with that paternal feeling let i tell you my countryman that you be delude by man who be either deceive themselves or wish to deceive you mark under what pretense you have be lead on to the brink of insurrection and treason on which you stand first a diminution of the value of your staple commodity lower by overproduction in other quarter and the consequent diminution in the value of your land be the sole effect of the tariff law the effect of those law be confessedly injurious but the evil be greatly exaggerate by the unfounded theory you be teach to believe that its burthen be in proportion to your export not to your consumption of import article your pride be rouse by the assertion that a submission to those law be a state of vassalage and that resistance to they be equal in patriotic merit to the opposition our father offer to the oppressive law of great britain you be tell that this opposition might be peaceably might be constitutionally make that you might enjoy all the advantage of the union and bear none of its burthen eloquent appeal to your passion to your state pride to your native courage to your sense of real injury be use to prepare you for the period when the mask which conceal the hideous feature of disunion should be take off it fall and you be make to look with complacency on object which not long since you would have regard with horror look back to the art which have bring you to this state look forward to the consequence to which it must inevitably lead look back to what be first tell you as an inducement to enter into this dangerous course the great political truth be repeat to you that you have the revolutionary right of resist all law that be palpably unconstitutional and intolerably oppressive it be add that the right to nullify a law rest on the same principle but that it be a peaceable remedy this character which be give to it make you receive with too much confidence the assertion that be make of the unconstitutionality of the law and its oppressive effect mark my fellow citizen that by the admission of your leader the unconstitutionality must be palpable or it will not justify either resistance or nullification what be the meaning of the word palpable in the sense in which it be here use that which be apparent to everyone that which no man of ordinary intellect will fail to perceive be the unconstitutionality of these law of that description let those among your leader who once approve and advocate the principle of protective duty answer the question and let they choose whether they will be consider as incapable then of perceive that which must have be apparent to every man of common understanding or as impose upon your confidence and endeavoring to mislead you now in either case they be unsafe guide in the perilous path they urge you to tread ponder well on this circumstance and you will know how to appreciate the exaggerated language they address to you they be not champion of liberty emulate the fame of our revolutionary father nor be you an oppressed people contend as they repeat to you against bad than colonial vassalage you be free member of a flourishing and happy union there be no settled design to oppress you you have indeed feel the unequal operation of law which may have be unwisely not unconstitutionally pass but that inequality must necessarily be remove at the very moment when you be madly urge on to the unfortunate course you have begin a change in public opinion have commence the nearly approach payment of the public debt and the consequent necessity of a diminution of duty have already produce a considerable reduction and that too on some article of general consumption in your state the importance of this change be underrated and you be authoritatively tell that no further alleviation of your burthen be to be expect at the very time when the condition of the country imperiously demand such a modification of the duty as should reduce they to a just and equitable scale but as if apprehensive of the effect of this change in allay your discontent you be precipitate into the fearful state in which you now find yourself
 i have urge you to look back to the mean that be use to hurry you on to the position you have now assume and forward to the consequence it will produce something more be necessary contemplate the condition of that country of which you still form an important part consider its government unite in one bond of common interest and general protection so many different state give to all their inhabitant the proud title of american citizen protect their commerce secure their literature and their art facilitate their intercommunication defend their frontier and make their name respect in the remotest part of the earth consider the extent of its territory its increase and happy population its advance in art which render life agreeable and the science which elevate the mind see education spread the light of religion morality and general information into every cottage in this wide extent of our territories and states behold it as the asylum where the wretched and the oppressed find a refuge and support look on this picture of happiness and honor and say we too be citizen of america carolina be one of these proud states her arm have defend her good blood have cement this happy union and then add if you can without horror and remorse this happy union we will dissolve this picture of peace and prosperity we will deface this free intercourse we will interrupt these fertile field we will deluge with blood the protection of that glorious flag we renounce the very name of americans we discard and for what mistaken man for what do you throw away these inestimable blessing for what would you exchange your share in the advantage and honor of the union for the dream of a separate independence a dream interrupt by bloody conflict with your neighbor and a vile dependence on a foreign power if your leader could succeed in establish a separation what would be your situation be you unite at home be you free from the apprehension of civil discord with all its fearful consequence do our neighboring republic every day suffer some new revolution or contend with some new insurrection do they excite your envy but the dictate of a high duty oblige i solemnly to announce that you can not succeed the law of the united states must be execute i have no discretionary power on the subject my duty be emphatically pronounce in the constitution those who tell you that you might peaceably prevent their execution deceive you they could not have be deceive themselves they know that a forcible opposition could alone prevent the execution of the law and they know that such opposition must be repel their object be disunion but be not deceive by name disunion by armed force be treason be you really ready to incur its guilt if you be on the head of the instigator of the act be the dreadful consequence on their head be the dishonor but on yours may fall the punishment on your unhappy state will inevitably fall all the evil of the conflict you force upon the government of your country it can not accede to the mad project of disunion of which you would be the first victim its first magistrate can not if he would avoid the performance of his duty the consequence must be fearful for you distress to your fellow citizen here and to the friend of good government throughout the world its enemy have behold our prosperity with a vexation they could not conceal it be a stand refutation of their slavish doctrine and they will point to our discord with the triumph of malignant joy it be yet in your power to disappoint they there be yet time to show that the descendant of the pinckneys the sumpters the rutledges and of the thousand other name which adorn the page of your revolutionary history will not abandon that union to support which so many of they fight and bleed and die i adjure you as you honor their memory as you love the cause of freedom to which they dedicate their life as you prize the peace of your country the life of its good citizen and your own fair fame to retrace your step snatch from the archive of your state the disorganize edict of its convention bid its member to reassemble and promulgate the decide expression of your will to remain in the path which alone can conduct you to safety prosperity and honor tell they that compare to disunion all other evil be light because that bring with it an accumulation of all declare that you will never take the field unless the star spangle banner of your country shall float over you that you will not be stigmatize when dead and dishonor and scorn while you live as the author of the first attack on the constitution of your country its destroyer you can not be you may disturb its peace you may interrupt the course of its prosperity you may cloud its reputation for stability but its tranquillity will be restore its prosperity will return and the stain upon its national character will be transfer and remain an eternal blot on the memory of those who cause the disorder
 fellow citizen of the united states the threat of unhallowed disunion the name of those once respect by whom it be utter the array of military force to support it denote the approach of a crisis in our affair on which the continuance of our unexampled prosperity our political existence and perhaps that of all free government may depend the conjuncture demand a free a full and explicit enunciation not only of my intention but of my principle of action and as the claim be assert of a right by a state to annul the law of the union and even to secede from it at pleasure a frank exposition of my opinion in relation to the origin and form of our government and the construction i give to the instrument by which it be create seem to be proper have the full confidence in the justness of the legal and constitutional opinion of my duty which have be express i rely with equal confidence on your undivided support in my determination to execute the law to preserve the union by all constitutional mean to arrest if possible by moderate and firm measure the necessity of a recourse to force and if it be the will of heaven that the recurrence of its primeval curse on man for the shedding of a brother&#39;s blood should fall upon our land that it be not call down by any offensive act on the part of the united states
 fellow citizen the momentous case be before you on your undivided support of your government depend the decision of the great question it involve whether your sacred union will be preserve and the blessing it secure to we as one people shall be perpetuate no one can doubt that the unanimity with which that decision will be express will be such as to inspire new confidence in republican institution and that the prudence the wisdom and the courage which it will bring to their defense will transmit they unimpaire and invigorate to our child
 may the great ruler of nations grant that the signal blessing with which he have favor our may not by the madness of party or personal ambition be disregard and lose and may his wise providence bring those who have produce this crisis to see the folly before they feel the misery of civil strife and inspire a return veneration for that union which if we may dare to penetrate his design he have choose as the only mean of attain the high destiny to which we may reasonably aspire
 in testimony whereof i have cause the seal of the united states to be hereunto affix having sign the same with my hand
 do at the city of washington this 10th day of december a.d. 1832 and of the independence of the united states the fifty seventh
 andrew jackson
 by the president
 edw livingston
 secretary of state

gentleman of the senate and house of representatives


 in my annual message at the commencement of your present session i advert to the opposition to the revenue law in a particular quarter of the united states which threaten not merely to thwart their execution but to endanger the integrity of the union and although i then express my reliance that it might be overcome by the prudence of the officer of the united states and the patriotism of the people i state that should the emergency arise render the execution of the exist law impracticable from any cause whatever prompt notice should be give to congress with the suggestion of such view and measure as might be necessary to meet it


 event which have occur in the quarter then allude to or which have come to my knowledge subsequently present this emergency
 since the date of my last annual message i have have officially transmit to i by the governor of south carolina which i now communicate to congress a copy of the ordinance pass by the convention which assemble at columbia in the state of south carolina in november last declare certain act of congress therein mention within the limit of that state to be absolutely null and void and make it the duty of the legislature to pass such law as would be necessary to carry the same into effect from and after the 1st february next
 the consequence to which this extraordinary defiance of the just authority of the government might too surely lead be clearly foresee and it be impossible for i to hesitate as to my own duty in such an emergency
 the ordinance have be pass however without any certain knowledge of the recommendation which from a view of the interest of the nation at large the executive have determine to submit to congress and a hope be indulge that by frankly explain his sentiment and the nature of those duty which the crisis would devolve upon he the authority of south carolina might be induce to retrace their step in this hope i determine to issue my proclamation of the 10th of december last a copy of which i now lie before congress
 i regret to inform you that these reasonable expectation have not be realize and that the several act of the legislature of south carolina which i now lay before you and which have all and each of they finally pass after a knowledge of the desire of the administration to modify the law complain of be too well calculate both in their positive enactment and in the spirit of opposition which they obviously encourage wholly to obstruct the collection of the revenue within the limit of that state
 up to this period neither the recommendation of the executive in regard to our financial policy and impost system nor the disposition manifest by congress promptly to act upon that subject nor the unequivocal expression of the public will in all part of the union appear to have produce any relaxation in the measure of opposition adopt by the state of south carolina nor be there any reason to hope that the ordinance and law will be abandon
 i have no knowledge that an attempt have be make or that it be in contemplation to reassemble either the convention or the legislature and it will be perceive that the interval before the 1st of february be too short to admit of the preliminary step necessary for that purpose it appear moreover that the state authority be actively organize their military resource and provide the mean and give the most solemn assurance of protection and support to all who shall enlist in opposition to the revenue law
 a recent proclamation of the present governor of south carolina have openly defy the authority of the executive of the union and general order from the headquarters of the state announce his determination to accept the service of volunteer and his belief that should their country need their service they will be find at the post of honor and duty ready to lay down their life in her defense under these order the force refer to be direct to hold themselves in readiness to take the field at a moment 's warning and in the city of charleston within a collection district and a port of entry a rendezvous have be open for the purpose of enlist man for the magazine and municipal guard thus south carolina present herself in the attitude of hostile preparation and ready even for military violence if need be to enforce her law for prevent the collection of the duty within her limit
 proceeding thus announce and mature must be distinguish from menace of unlawful resistance by irregular body of people who act under temporary delusion may be restrain by reflection and the influence of public opinion from the commission of actual outrage in the present instance aggression may be regard as commit when it be officially authorize and the mean of enforce it fully provide
 under these circumstance there can be no doubt that it be the determination of the authority of south carolina fully to carry into effect their ordinance and law after the 1st of february it therefore become my duty to bring the subject to the serious consideration of congress in order that such measure as they in their wisdom may deem fit shall be seasonably provide and that it may be thereby understand that while the government be disposed to remove all just cause of complaint as far as may be practicable consistently with a proper regard to the interest of the community at large it be nevertheless determined that the supremacy of the law shall be maintain
 in make this communication it appear to i to be proper not only that i should lay before you the act and proceeding of south carolina but that i should also fully acquaint you with those step which i have already cause to be take for the due collection of the revenue and with my view of the subject generally that the suggestion which the constitution require i to make in regard to your future legislation may be well understand
 this subject having early attract the anxious attention of the executive as soon as it be probable that the authority of south carolina seriously meditate resistance to the faithful execution of the revenue law it be deem advisable that the secretary of the treasury should particularly instruct the officer of the united states in that part of the union as to the nature of the duty prescribe by the exist law
 instruction be accordingly issue on the 6th of november to the collector in that state point out their respective duty and enjoin upon each a firm and vigilant but discreet performance of they in the emergency then apprehend
 i herewith transmit copy of these instruction and of the letter address to the district attorney request his cooperation these instruction be dictate in the hope that as the opposition to the law by the anomalous proceeding of nullification be represent to be of a pacific nature to be pursue substantially accord to the form of the constitution and without resort in any event to force or violence the measure of its advocate would be take in conformity with that profession and on such supposition the mean afford by the exist law would have be adequate to meet any emergency likely to arise
 it be however not possible altogether to suppress apprehension of the excess to which the excitement prevail in that quarter might lead but it certainly be not foresee that the meditated obstruction to the law would so soon openly assume its present character
 subsequently to the date of those instruction however the ordinance of the convention be pass which if comply with by the people of the state must effectually render inoperative the present revenue law within her limit
 that ordinance declare and ordains--
 that the several act and part of act of the congress of the united states purport to be law for the imposing of duty and impost on the importation of foreign commodity and now have operation and effect within the united states and more especially an act in alteration of the several act impose duty on import approve on the 19th of may 1828 and also an act entitle an act to alter and amend the several act impose duty on import approve on the 14th july 1832 be unauthorized by the constitution of the united states and violate the true intent and mean thereof and be null and void and no law nor bind upon the state of south carolina its officer and citizen and all promise contract and obligation make or enter into or to be make or enter into with purpose to secure the duty impose by the said act and all judicial proceeding which shall be hereafter have in affirmance thereof be and shall be hold utterly null and void
 it also ordains--
 that it shall not be lawful for any of the constituted authority whether of the state of south carolina or of the united states to enforce the payment of duty impose by the say act within the limit of the state but that it shall be the duty of the legislature to adopt such measure and pass such act as may be necessary to give full effect to this ordinance and to prevent the enforcement and arrest the operation of the say act and part of act of the congress of the united states within the limit of the state from and after the 1st of february next and it shall be the duty of all other constitute authority and of all other person reside or be within the limit of the state and they be hereby require and enjoin to obey and give effect to this ordinance and such act and measure of the legislature as may be pass or adopt in obedience thereto
 it far ordains--
 that in no case of law or equity decide in the court of the state wherein shall be draw in question the authority of this ordinance or the validity of such act or act of the legislature as may be pass for the purpose of give effect thereto or the validity of the aforesaid act of congress impose duty shall any appeal be take or allow to the supreme court of the united states nor shall any copy of the record be permit or allow for that purpose and the person or person attempt to take such appeal may be deal with as for a contempt of court
 it likewise ordains--
 that all person hold any office of honor profit or trust civil or military under the state shall within such time and in such manner as the legislature shall prescribe take an oath well and truly to obey execute and enforce this ordinance and such act or act of the legislature as may be pass in pursuance thereof accord to the true intent and meaning of the same and on the neglect or omission of any such person or person so to do his or their office or office shall be forthwith vacate and shall be fill up as if such person or person be dead or have resign and no person hereafter elect to any office of honor profit or trust civil or military shall until the legislature shall otherwise provide and direct enter on the execution of his office or be in any respect competent to discharge the duty thereof until he shall in like manner have take a similar oath and no juror shall be empanel in any of the court of the state in any cause in which shall be in question this ordinance or any act of the legislature pass in pursuance thereof unless he shall first in addition to the usual oath have take an oath that he will well and truly obey execute and enforce this ordinance and such act or act of the legislature as may be pass to carry the same into operation and effect accord to the true intent and mean thereof
 the ordinance conclude
 and we the people of south carolina to the end that it may be fully understand by the government of the united states and the people of the co states that we be determined to maintain this ordinance and declaration at every hazard do far declare that we will not submit to the application of force on the part of the federal government to reduce this state to obedience but that we will consider the passage by congress of any act authorize the employment of a military or naval force against the state of south carolina her constitute authority or citizen or any act abolish or close the port of this state or any of they or otherwise obstruct the free ingress and egress of vessel to and from the say port or any other act on the part of the federal government to coerce the state shut up her port destroy or harass her commerce or to enforce the act hereby declare to be null and void otherwise than through the civil tribunal of the country as inconsistent with the long continuance of south carolina in the union and that the people of this state will thenceforth hold themselves absolve from all further obligation to maintain or preserve their political connection with the people of the other states and will forthwith proceed to organize a separate government and to do all other act and thing which sovereign and independent state may of right do
 this solemn denunciation of the law and authority of the united states have be follow up by a series of act on the part of the authority of that state which manifest a determination to render inevitable a resort to those measure of self defense which the paramount duty of the federal government require but upon the adoption of which that state will proceed to execute the purpose it have avow in this ordinance of withdraw from the union
 on the 27th of november the legislature assemble at columbia and on their meeting the governor lay before they the ordinance of the convention in his message on that occasion he acquaint they that this ordinance have thus become a part of the fundamental law of south carolina that the die have be at last cast and south carolina have at length appeal to her ulterior sovereignty as a member of this confederacy and have plant herself on her reserved right the rightful exercise of this power be not a question which we shall any long argue it be sufficient that she have will it and that the act be do nor be its strict compatibility with our constitutional obligation to all law pass by the general government within the authorize grant of power to be draw in question when this interposition be exert in a case in which the compact have be palpably deliberately and dangerously violate that it bring up a conjuncture of deep and momentous interest be neither to be conceal nor deny this crisis present a class of duty which be referable to yourself you have be command by the people in their high sovereignty to take care that within the limit of this state their will shall be obey the measure of legislation he say which you have to employ at this crisis be the precise amount of such enactment as may be necessary to render it utterly impossible to collect within our limit the duty impose by the protective tariff thus nullify
 he proceed
 that you should arm every citizen with a civil process by which he may claim if he please a restitution of his good seize under the exist impost on his give security to abide the issue of a suit at law and at the same time define what shall constitute treason against the state and by a bill of pain and penalty compel obedience and punish disobedience to your own law be point too obvious to require any discussion in one word you must survey the whole ground you must look to and provide for all possible contingency in your own limit your own court of judicature must not only be supreme but you must look to the ultimate issue of any conflict of jurisdiction and power between they and the court of the united states
 the governor also ask for power to grant clearance in violation of the law of the union and to prepare for the alternative which must happen unless the united states shall passively surrender their authority and the executive disregard his oath refrain from execute the law of the union he recommend a thorough revision of the militia system and that the governor be authorize to accept for the defense of charleston and its dependency the service of 2,000 volunteer either by company or file and that they be form into a legionary brigade consist of infantry rifleman cavalry field and heavy artillery and that they be armed and equip from the public arsenal completely for the field and that appropriation be make for supply all deficiency in our munition of war in addition to these volunteer draft he recommend that the governor be authorize to accept the service of 10,000 volunteer from the other division of the state to be organize and arrange in regiment and brigade the officer to be select by the commander in chief and that this whole force be call the state guard
 a request have be regularly make of the secretary of state of south carolina for authentic copy of the act which have be pass for the purpose of enforce the ordinance but up to the date of the late advice that request have not be comply with and on the present occasion therefore reference can only be make to those act as publish in the newspaper of the state
 the act to which it be deem proper to invite the particular attention of congress be
 first an act to carry into effect in part an ordinance to nullify certain act of the congress of the united states purport to be law lay duty on the importation of foreign commodity pass in convention of this state at columbia on the 24th november 1832
 this act provide that any good seize or detain under pretense of secure the duty or for the nonpayment of duty or under any process order or decree or other pretext contrary to the intent and meaning of the ordinance may be recover by the owner or consignee by an act of replevin that in case of refuse to deliver they or remove they so that the replevin can not be execute the sheriff may seize the personal estate of the offender to double the amount of the good and if any attempt shall be make to retake or seize they it be the duty of the sheriff to recapture they and that any person who shall disobey the process or remove the good or anyone who shall attempt to retake or seize the good under pretense of secure the duty or for nonpayment of duty or under any process or decree contrary to the intent of the ordinance shall be fine and imprison besides be liable for any other offense involve in the act

 the next be call an act to provide for the security and protection of the people of the state of south carolina
 this act provide that if the government of the united states or any officer thereof shall by the employment of naval or military force attempt to coerce the state of south carolina into submission to the act of congress declare by the ordinance null and void or to resist the enforcement of the ordinance or of the law pass in pursuance thereof or in case of any armed or forcible resistance thereto the governor be authorize to resist the same and to order into service the whole or so much of the military force of the state as he may deem necessary and that in case of any overt act of coercion or intention to commit the same manifest by an unusual assemblage of naval or military force in or near the state or the occurrence of any circumstance indicate that armed force be about to be employ against the state or in resistance to its law the governor be authorize to accept the service of such volunteer and call into service such portion of the militia as may be require to meet the emergency
 the act also provide for accept the service of the volunteer and organize the militia embrace all free white male between the age of 16 and 60 and for the purchase of arm ordnance and ammunition it also declare that the power confer on the governor shall be applicable to all case of insurrection or invasion or imminent danger thereof and to case where the law of the state shall be oppose and the execution thereof forcibly resist by combination too powerful to be suppress by the power vest in the sheriff and other civil officer and declare it to be the duty of the governor in every such case to call forth such portion of the militia and volunteer as may be necessary promptly to suppress such combination and cause the law of the state to be execute
 no 9 be an act concern the oath require by the ordinance pass in convention at columbia on the 24th of november 1832
 this act prescribe the form of the oath which be to obey and execute the ordinance and all act pass by the legislature in pursuance thereof and direct the time and manner of take it by the officer of the state civil judiciary and military
 it be believe that other act have be pass embrace provision for enforce the ordinance but i have not yet be able to procure they
 i transmit however a copy of governor hamilton 's message to the legislature of south carolina of governor hayne 's inaugural address to the same body as also of his proclamation and a general order of the governor and commander in chief date the 20th of december give public notice that the service of volunteer will be accept under the act already refer to
 if these measure can not be defeat and overcome by the power confer by the constitution on the federal government the constitution must be consider as incompetent to its own defense the supremacy of the law be at an end and the right and liberty of the citizen can no long receive protection from the government of the union they not only abrogate the act of congress commonly call the tariff act of 1828 and 1832 but they prostrate and sweep away at once and without exception every act and every part of every act impose any amount whatever of duty on any foreign merchandise and virtually every existing act which have ever be pass authorize the collection of the revenue include the act of 1816 and also the collection law of 1799 the constitutionality of which have never be question it be not only those duty which be charge to have be impose for the protection of manufacture that be thereby repeal but all other though lay for the purpose of revenue merely and upon article in no degree suspect of be object of protection the whole revenue system of the united states in south carolina be obstruct and overthrow and the government be absolutely prohibit from collect any part of the public revenue within the limit of that state henceforth not only the citizen of south carolina and of the united states but the subject of foreign state may import any description or quantity of merchandise into the port of south carolina without the payment of any duty whatsoever that state be thus relieve from the payment of any part of the public burthen and duty and impost be not only render not uniform throughout the united states but a direct and ruinous preference be give to the port of that state over those of all the other states of the union in manifest violation of the positive provision of the constitution
 in point of duration also those aggression upon the authority of congress which by the ordinance be make part of the fundamental law of south carolina be absolute indefinite and without limitation they neither prescribe the period when they shall cease nor indicate any condition upon which those who have thus undertake to arrest the operation of the law be to retrace their step and rescind their measure they offer to the united states no alternative but unconditional submission if the scope of the ordinance be to be receive as the scale of concession their demand can be satisfied only by a repeal of the whole system of revenue law and by abstain from the collection of any duty and impost whatsoever
 it be true that in the address to the people of the united states by the convention of south carolina after announce the fixed and final determination of the state in relation to the protect system they say that it remain for we to submit a plan of taxation in which we would be willing to acquiesce in a liberal spirit of concession provide we be meet in due time and in a become spirit by the states interested in manufacture in the opinion of the convention an equitable plan would be that the whole list of protect article should be import free of all duty and that the revenue derive from import duty should be raise exclusively from the unprotected article or that whenever a duty be impose upon protect article import an excise duty of the same rate shall be impose upon all similar article manufacture in the united states
 the address proceed to state however that they be willing to make a large offering to preserve the union and with a distinct declaration that it be a concession on our part we will consent that the same rate of duty may be impose upon the protect article that shall be impose upon the unprotected provide that no more revenue be raise than be necessary to meet the demand of the government for constitutional purpose and provide also that a duty substantially uniform be impose upon all foreign import
 it be also true that in his message to the legislature when urge the necessity of provide mean of secure their safety by ample resource for repel force by force the governor of south carolina observe that he can not but think that on a calm and dispassionate review by congress and the functionary of the general government of the true merit of this controversy the arbitration by a call of a convention of all the states which we sincerely and anxiously seek and desire will be accord to we
 from the diversity of term indicate in these two important document take in connection with the progress of recent event in that quarter there be too much reason to apprehend without in any manner doubt the intention of those public functionary that neither the term propose in the address of the convention nor those allude to in the message of the governor would appease the excitement which have lead to the present excess it be obvious however that should the latter be insist on they present an alternative which the general government of itself can by no possibility grant since by an express provision of the constitution congress can call a convention for the purpose of propose amendment only on the application of the legislature of two third of the states and it be not perceive that the term present in the address be more practicable than those refer to in the message
 it will not escape attention that the condition on which it be say in the address of the convention they would be willing to acquiesce form no part of the ordinance while this ordinance bear all the solemnity of a fundamental law be to be authoritative upon all within the limit of south carolina and be absolute and unconditional in its term the address convey only the sentiment of the convention in no binding or practical form one be the act of the state the other only the expression of the opinion of the member of the convention to limit the effect of that solemn act by any term or condition whatever they should have be embody in it and make of import no less authoritative than the act itself by the positive enactment of the ordinance the execution of the law of the union be absolutely prohibit and the address offer no other prospect of their be again restore even in the modify form propose than what depend upon the improbable contingency that amid change event and increase excitement the sentiment of the present member of the convention and of their successor will remain the same
 it be to be regret however that these condition even if they have be offer in the same bind form be so undefined depend upon so many contingency and be so directly oppose to the known opinion and interest of the great body of the american people as to be almost hopeless of attainment the majority of the states and of the people will certainly not consent that the protect duty shall be wholly abrogate never to be reenact at any future time or in any possible contingency as little practicable be it to provide that the same rate of duty shall be impose upon the protect article that shall be impose upon the unprotected which moreover would be severely oppressive to the poor and in time of war would add greatly to its rigor and though there can be no objection to the principle properly understand that no more revenue shall be raise than be necessary for the constitutional purpose of the government which principle have be already recommend by the executive as the true basis of taxation yet it be very certain that south carolina alone can not be permit to decide what these constitutional purpose be
 the period which constitute the due time in which the term propose in the address be to be accept would seem to present scarcely less difficulty than the term themselves though the revenue law be already declare to be void in south carolina as well as the bond take under they and the judicial proceeding for carry they into effect yet as the full action and operation of the ordinance be to be suspend until the 1st of february the interval may be assume as the time within which it be expect that the most complicated portion of the national legislation a system of long standing and affect great interest in the community be to be rescind and abolish if this be require it be clear that a compliance be impossible
 in the uncertainty then that exist as to the duration of the ordinance and of the enactment for enforce it it become imperiously the duty of the executive of the united states act with a proper regard to all the great interest commit to his care to treat those act as absolute and unlimited they be so as far as his agency be concern he can not either embrace or lead to the performance of the condition he have already discharge the only part in his power by the recommendation in his annual message the rest be with congress and the people and until they have act his duty will require he to look to the exist state of thing and act under they accord to his high obligation
 by these various proceeding therefore the state of south carolina have force the general government unavoidably to decide the new and dangerous alternative of permit a state to obstruct the execution of the law within its limit or see it attempt to execute a threat of withdraw from the union that portion of the people at present exercise the authority of the state solemnly assert their right to do either and as solemnly announce their determination to do one or the other
 in my opinion both purpose be to be regard as revolutionary in their character and tendency and subversive of the supremacy of the law and of the integrity of the union the result of each be the same since a state in which by an usurpation of power the constitutional authority of the federal government be openly defy and set aside want only the form to be independent of the union
 the right of the people of a single state to absolve themselves at will and without the consent of the other states from their most solemn obligation and hazard the liberty and happiness of the million compose this union can not be acknowledge such authority be believe to be utterly repugnant both to the principle upon which the general government be constitute and to the object which it be expressly form to attain
 against all act which may be allege to transcend the constitutional power of the government or which may be inconvenient or oppressive in their operation the constitution itself have prescribe the mode of redress it be the acknowledge attribute of free institution that under they the empire of reason and law be substitute for the power of the sword to no other source can appeal for suppose wrong be make consistently with the obligation of south carolina to no other can such appeal be make with safety at any time and to their decision when constitutionally pronounce it become the duty no less of the public authority than of the people in every case to yield a patriotic submission
 that a state or any other great portion of the people suffer under long and intolerable oppression and having try all constitutional remedy without the hope of redress may have a natural right when their happiness can be no otherwise secure and when they can do so without great injury to other to absolve themselves from their obligation to the government and appeal to the last resort need not on the present occasion be deny
 the existence of this right however must depend upon the cause which may justify its exercise it be the ultima ratio which presuppose that the proper appeal to all other mean of redress have be make in good faith and which can never be rightfully resort to unless it be unavoidable it be not the right of the state but of the individual and of all the individual in the state it be the right of mankind generally to secure by all mean in their power the blessing of liberty and happiness but when for these purpose any body of man have voluntarily associate themselves under a particular form of government no portion of they can dissolve the association without acknowledge the correlative right in the remainder to decide whether that dissolution can be permit consistently with the general happiness in this view it be a right dependent upon the power to enforce it such a right though may be admit to preexist and can not be wholly surrender be necessarily subject to limitation in all free government and in compact of all kind freely and voluntarily enter into and in which the interest and welfare of the individual become identify with those of the community of which he be a member in compact between individual however deeply they may affect their relation these principle be acknowledge to create a sacred obligation and in compact of civil government involve the liberty and happiness of million of mankind the obligation can not be less
 without advert to the particular theory to which the federal compact have give rise both as to its formation and the party to it and without inquire whether it be merely federal or social or national it be sufficient that it must be admit to be a compact and to possess the obligation incident to a compact to be a compact by which power be create on the one hand and obedience exact on the other a compact freely voluntarily and solemnly enter into by the several states and ratify by the people thereof respectively a compact by which the several states and the people thereof respectively have bind themselves to each other and to the federal government and by which the federal government be bind to the several states and to every citizen of the united states to this compact in whatever mode it may have be do the people of south carolina have freely and voluntarily give their assent and to the whole and every part of it they be upon every principle of good faith inviolably bind under this obligation they be bind and should be require to contribute their portion of the public expense and to submit to all law make by the common consent in pursuance of the constitution for the common defense and general welfare until they can be change in the mode which the compact have provide for the attainment of those great end of the government and of the union nothing less than cause which would justify revolutionary remedy can absolve the people from this obligation and for nothing less can the government permit it to be do without violate its own obligation by which under the compact it be bind to the other states and to every citizen of the united states
 these deduction plainly flow from the nature of the federal compact which be one of limitation not only upon the power originally possess by the party thereto but also upon those confer on the government and every department thereof it will be freely concede that by the principle of our system all power be vest in the people but to be exercise in the mode and subject to the check which the people themselves have prescribe these check be undoubtedly only different modification of the same great popular principle which lie at the foundation of the whole but be not on that account to be less regarded or less obligatory
 upon the power of congress the veto of the executive and the authority of the judiciary which be to extend to all case in law and equity arise under the constitution and law of the united states make in pursuance thereof be the obvious check and the sound action of public opinion with the ultimate power of amendment be the salutary and only limitation upon the power of the whole
 however it may be allege that a violation of the compact by the measure of the government can affect the obligation of the party it can not even be pretend that such violation can be predicate of those measure until all the constitutional remedy shall have be fully try if the federal government exercise power not warrant by the constitution and immediately affect individual it will scarcely be deny that the proper remedy be a recourse to the judiciary such undoubtedly be the remedy for those who deem the act of congress lay duty and impost and provide for their collection to be unconstitutional the whole operation of such law be upon the individual import the merchandise a state be absolutely prohibit from lay impost or duty on import or export without the consent of congress and can not become a party under these law without import in her own name or wrongfully interpose her authority against they by thus interpose however she can not rightfully obstruct the operation of the law upon individual for their disobedience to or violation of the law the ordinary remedy through the judicial tribunal would remain and in a case where an individual should be prosecute for any offense against the law he could not set up in justification of his act a law of the state which be unconstitutional would therefore be regard as null and void the law of a state can not authorize the commission of a crime against the united states or any other act which accord to the supreme law of the union would be otherwise unlawful and it be equally clear that if there be any case in which a state as such be affect by the law beyond the scope of judicial power the remedy consist in appeal to the people either to effect a change in the representation or to procure relief by an amendment of the constitution but the measure of the government be to be recognize as valid and consequently supreme until these remedy shall have be effectually try and any attempt to subvert those measure or to render the law subordinate to state authority and afterwards to resort to constitutional redress be bad than evasive it would not be a proper resistance to a government of unlimited power as have be sometimes pretend but unlawful opposition to the very limitation on which the harmonious action of the government and all its part absolutely depend south carolina have appeal to none of these remedy but in effect have defy they all while threaten to separate from the union if any attempt be make to enforce the revenue law otherwise than through the civil tribunal of the country she have not only not appeal in her own name to those tribunal which the constitution have provide for all case in law or equity arise under the constitution and law of the united states but have endeavor to frustrate their proper action on her citizen by draw the cognizance of case under the revenue law to her own tribunal specially prepared and fit for the purpose of enforce the act pass by the state to obstruct those law and both the judge and juror of which will be bind by the import of oath previously take to treat the constitution and law of the united states in this respect as a nullity nor have the state make the proper appeal to public opinion and to the remedy of amendment for without wait to learn whether the other states will consent to a convention or if they do will construe or amend the constitution to suit her view she have of her own authority alter the import of that instrument and give immediate effect to the change in fine she have set her own will and authority above the law have make herself arbiter in her own cause and have pass at once over all intermediate step to measure of avow resistance which unless they be submit to can be enforce only by the sword
 in decide upon the course which a high sense of duty to all the people of the united states impose upon the authority of the union in this emergency it can not be overlook that there be no sufficient cause for the act of south carolina or for she thus place in jeopardy the happiness of so many million of people misrule and oppression to warrant the disruption of the free institution of the union of these states should be great and lasting defy all other remedy for cause of minor character the government could not submit to such a catastrophe without a violation of its most sacred obligation to the other states of the union who have submit their destiny to its hand
 there be in the present instance no such cause either in the degree of misrule or oppression complain of or in the hopelessness of redress by constitutional mean the long sanction they have receive from the proper authority and from the people not less than the unexampled growth and increase prosperity of so many million of freeman attest that no such oppression as would justify or even palliate such a resort can be justly impute either to the present policy or past measure of the federal government
 the same mode of collect duty and for the same general object which begin with the foundation of the government and which have conduct the country through its subsequent step to its present enviable condition of happiness and renown have not be change taxation and representation the great principle of the american revolution have continually go hand in hand and at all time and in every instance no tax of any kind have be impose without their participation and in some instance which have be complain of with the express assent of a part of the representative of south carolina in the council of the government up to the present period no revenue have be raise beyond the necessary want of the country and the authorized expenditure of the government and as soon as the burthen of the public debt be remove those charge with the administration have promptly recommend a corresponding reduction of revenue
 that this system thus pursue have result in no such oppression upon south carolina need no other proof than the solemn and official declaration of the late chief magistrate of that state in his address to the legislature in that he say that--
 the occurrence of the past year in connection with our domestic concern be to be review with a sentiment of fervent gratitude to the great disposer of human event that tribute of grateful acknowledgment be due for the various and multiplied blessing he have be pleased to bestow on our people that abundant harvest in every quarter of the state have crown the exertion of agricultural labor that health almost beyond former precedent have bless our home and that there be not less reason for thankfulness in survey our social condition
 it would indeed be difficult to imagine oppression where in the social condition of a people there be equal cause of thankfulness as for abundant harvest and varied and multiplied blessing with which a kind providence have favor they
 independently of these consideration it will not escape observation that south carolina still claim to be a component part of the union to participate in the national council and to share in the public benefit without contribute to the public burden thus assert the dangerous anomaly of continue in an association without acknowledge any other obligation to its law than what depend upon her own will
 in this posture of affair the duty of the government seem to be plain it inculcate a recognition of that state as a member of the union and subject to its authority a vindication of the just power of the constitution the preservation of the integrity of the union and the execution of the law by all constitutional mean
 the constitution which his oath of office oblige he to support declare that the executive shall take care that the law be faithfully execute and in provide that he shall from time to time give to congress information of the state of the union and recommend to their consideration such measure as he shall judge necessary and expedient impose the additional obligation of recommend to congress such more efficient provision for execute the law as may from time to time be find requisite
 the same instrument confer on congress the power not merely to lay and collect taxis duty impost and excise to pay the debt and provide for the common defense and general welfare but to make all law which shall be necessary and proper for carry into effect the forego power and all other power vest by the constitution in the government of the united states or in any department or officer thereof and also to provide for call forth the militia for execute the law of the union in all case similar to the present the duty of the government become the measure of its power and whenever it fail to exercise a power necessary and proper to the discharge of the duty prescribe by the constitution it violate the public trust not less than it would in transcend its proper limit to refrain therefore from the high and solemn duty thus enjoin however painful the performance may be and thereby tacitly permit the rightful authority of the government to be contemn and its law obstruct by a single state would neither comport with its own safety nor the right of the great body of the american people
 it be thus show to be the duty of the executive to execute the law by all constitutional mean it remain to consider the extent of those already at his disposal and what it may be proper far to provide
 in the instruction of the secretary of the treasury to the collector in south carolina the provision and regulation make by the act of 1799 and also the fine penalty and forfeiture for their enforcement be particularly detailed and explain it may be well apprehend however that these provision may prove inadequate to meet such an open powerful organized opposition as be to be commence after the 1st of february next
 subsequently to the date of these instruction and to the passage of the ordinance information have be receive from source entitle to be rely on that owe to the popular excitement in the state and the effect of the ordinance declare the execution of the revenue law unlawful a sufficient number of person in whom confidence might be place could not be induce to accept the office of inspector to oppose with any probability of success the force which will no doubt be use when an attempt be make to remove vessel and their cargo from the custody of the officer of the custom and indeed that it would be impracticable for the collector with the aid of any number of inspector whom he may be authorize to employ to preserve the custody against such an attempt
 the removal of the custom house from charleston to castle pinckney be deem a measure of necessary precaution and though the authority to give that direction be not question it be nevertheless apparent that a similar precaution can not be observe in regard to the port of georgetown and beaufort each of which under the present law remain a port of entry and expose to the obstruction meditate in that quarter
 in consider the good mean of avoid or of prevent the apprehend obstruction to the collection of the revenue and the consequence which may ensue it would appear to be proper and necessary to enable the officer of the custom to preserve the custody of vessel and their cargo which by the exist law they be require to take until the duty to which they be liable shall be pay or secure the mode by which it be contemplate to deprive they of that custody be the process of replevin and that of capia in withernam in the nature of a distress from the state tribunal organize by the ordinance
 against the proceeding in the nature of a distress it be not perceive that the collector can interpose any resistance whatever and against the process of replevin authorize by the law of the state he have no common law power can only oppose such inspector as he be by statute authorize and may find it practicable to employ and these from the information already advert to be show to be wholly inadequate
 the respect which that process deserve must therefore be consider
 if the authority of south carolina have not obstruct the legitimate action of the court of the united states or if they have permit the state tribunal to administer the law accord to their oath under the constitution and the regulation of the law of the union the general government might have be content to look to they for maintain the custody and to encounter the other inconvenience arise out of the recent proceeding even in that case however the process of replevin from the court of the state would be irregular and unauthorized it have be decide by the supreme court of the united states that the court of the united states have exclusive jurisdiction of all seizure make on land or water for a breach of the law of the united states and any intervention of a state authority which by take the thing seize out of the hand of the united states officer might obstruct the exercise of this jurisdiction be unlawful that in such case the court of the united states have cognizance of the seizure may enforce a redelivery of the thing by attachment or other summary process that the question under such a seizure whether a forfeiture have be actually incur belong exclusively to the court of the united states and it depend on the final decree whether the seizure be to be deem rightful or tortuous and that not until the seizure be finally judge wrongful and without probable cause by the court of the united states can the party proceed at common law for damage in the state court
 but by make it unlawful for any of the constituted authority whether of the united states or of the state to enforce the law for the payment of duty and declare that all judicial proceeding which shall be hereafter have in affirmance of the contract make with purpose to secure the duty impose by the say act be and shall be hold utterly null and void she have in effect abrogate the judicial tribunal within her limit in this respect have virtually deny the united states access to the court establish by their own law and declare it unlawful for the judge to discharge those duty which they be swear to perform in lieu of these she have substitute those state tribunal already advert to the judge whereof be not merely forbid to allow an appeal or permit a copy of their record but be previously swear to disregard the law of the union and enforce those only of south carolina and thus deprive of the function essential to the judicial character of inquire into the validity of the law and the right of the matter become merely ministerial instrument in aid of the concerted obstruction of the law of the union
 neither the process nor authority of these tribunal thus constitute can be respect consistently with the supremacy of the law or the right and security of the citizen if they be submit to the protection due from the government to its officer and citizen be withhold and there be at once an end not only to the law but to the union itself
 against such a force as the sheriff may and which by the replevin law of south carolina it be his duty to exercise it can not be expect that a collector can retain his custody with the aid of the inspector in such case it be true it would be competent to institute suit in the united states court against those engage in the unlawful proceeding or the property might be seize for a violation of the revenue law and be libel in the proper court an order might be make for its redelivery which would be commit to the marshal for execution but in that case the fourth section of the act in broad and unqualified term make it the duty of the sheriff to prevent such recapture or seizure or to redeliver the good as the case may be even under any process order or decree or other pretext contrary to the true intent and meaning of the ordinance aforesaid it be thus make the duty of the sheriff to oppose the process of the court of the united states and for that purpose if need be to employ the whole power of the county and the act expressly reserve to he all power which independently of its provision he could have use in this reservation it obviously contemplate a resort to other mean than those particularly mention
 it be not to be disguise that the power which it be thus enjoin upon the sheriff to employ be nothing less than the posse comitatus in all the rigor of the ancient common law this power though it may be use against unlawful resistance to judicial process be in its character forcible and analogous to that confer upon the marshal by the act of 1795 it be in fact the embodying of the whole mass of the population under the command of a single individual to accomplish by their forcible aid what could not be effect peaceably and by the ordinary mean it may properly be say to be a relic of those age in which the law could be defend rather by physical than moral force and in its origin be confer upon the sheriff of england to enable they to defend their county against any of the king 's enemy when they come into the land as well as for the purpose of execute process in early and less civilized time it be intend to include the aid and attendance of all knight and other who be bind to have harness it include the right of go with arm and military equipment and embrace large class and great masse of population than can be compel by the law of most of the states to perform militia duty if the principle of the common law be recognize in south carolina and from this act it would seem they be the power of summon the posse comitatus will compel under the penalty of fine and imprisonment every man over the age of 15 and able to travel to turn out at the call of the sheriff and with such weapon as may be necessary and it my justify beat and even kill such as may resist the use of the posse comitatus be therefore a direct application of force and can not be otherwise regard than as the employment of the whole militia force of the county and in an equally efficient form under a different name no proceeding which resort to this power to the extent contemplate by the act can be properly denominate peaceable
 the act of south carolina however do not rely altogether upon this forcible remedy for even attempt to resist or disobey though by the aid only of the ordinary officer of the custom the process of replevin the collector and all concerned be subject to a further proceeding in the nature of a distress of their personal effect and be moreover make guilty of a misdemeanor and liable to be punish by a fine of not less than $ 1,000 nor more than $ 5,000 and to imprisonment not exceed two year and not less than six month and for even attempt to execute the order of the court for retake the property the marshal and all assist would be guilty of a misdemeanor and liable to a fine of not less than $ 3,000 nor more than $ 10,000 and to imprisonment not exceed two year nor less than one and in case the good should be retake under such process it be make the absolute duty of the sheriff to retake they
 it be not to be suppose that in the face of these penalty aid by the powerful force of the county which would doubtless be bring to sustain the state officer either that the collector would retain the custody in the first instance or that the marshal could summon sufficient aid to retake the property pursuant to the order or other process of the court
 it be moreover obvious that in this conflict between the power of the officer of the united states and of the state unless the latter be passively submit to the destruction to which the property of the officer of the custom would be expose the commission of actual violence and the loss of life would be scarcely avoidable
 under these circumstance and the provision of the act of south carolina the execution of the law be render impracticable even through the ordinary judicial tribunal of the united states there would certainly be few difficulty and less opportunity of actual collision between the officer of the united states and of the state and the collection of the revenue would be more effectually secure if indeed it can be do in any other way by place the custom house beyond the immediate power of the county
 for this purpose it might be proper to provide that whenever by any unlawful combination or obstruction in any state or in any port it should become impracticable faithfully to collect the duty the president of the united states should be authorize to alter and abolish such of the district and port of entry as should be necessary and to establish the custom house at some secure place within some port or harbor of such state and in such case it should be the duty of the collector to reside at such place and to detain all vessel and cargoe until the duty impose by law should be properly secure or pay in cash deduct interest that in such case it should be unlawful to take the vessel and cargo from the custody of the proper officer of the custom unless by process from the ordinary judicial tribunal of the united states and that in case of an attempt otherwise to take the property by a force too great to be overcome by the officer of the custom it should be lawful to protect the possession of the officer by the employment of the land and naval force and militia under provision similar to those authorize by the eleventh section of the act of the 9th of january 1809
 this provision however would not shield the officer and citizen of the united states act under the law from suit and prosecution in the tribunal of the state which might thereafter be bring against they nor would it protect their property from the proceeding by distress and it may well be apprehend that it would be insufficient to insure a proper respect to the process of the constitutional tribunal in prosecution for offense against the united states and to protect the authority of the united states whether judicial or ministerial in the performance of their duty it would moreover be inadequate to extend the protection due from the government to that portion of the people of south carolina against outrage and oppression of any kind who may manifest their attachment and yield obedience to the law of the union
 it may therefore be desirable to revive with some modification well adapt to the occasion the sixth section of the act of the 3d march 1815 which expire on the 4th march 1817 by the limitation of that of 27th april 1816 and to provide that in any case where suit shall be bring against any individual in the court of the state for any act do under the law of the united states he should be authorize to remove the said cause by petition into the circuit court of the united states without any copy of the record and that the court should proceed to hear and determine the same as if it have be originally institute therein and that in all case of injury to the person or property of individual for disobedience to the ordinance and law of south carolina in pursuance thereof redress may be seek in the court of the united states it may be expedient also by modify the resolution of the 3d march 1791 to authorize the marshal to make the necessary provision for the safe keeping of prisoner commit under the authority of the united states
 provision less than these consist as they do for the most part rather of a revival of the policy of former act call for by the exist emergency than of the introduction of any unusual or rigorous enactment would not cause the law of the union to be properly respect or enforce it be believe these would prove adequate unless the military force of the state of south carolina authorize by the late act of the legislature should be actually embody and call out in aid of their proceeding and of the provision of the ordinance generally even in that case however it be believe that no more will be necessary than a few modification of its term to adapt the act of 1795 to the present emergency as by that act the provision of the law of 1792 be accommodate to the crisis then exist and by confer authority upon the president to give it operation during the session of congress and without the ceremony of a proclamation whenever it shall be officially make known to he by the authority of any state or by the court of the united states that within the limit of such state the law of the united states will be openly oppose and their execution obstruct by the actual employment of military force or by any unlawful mean whatsoever too great to be otherwise overcome
 in close this communication i should do injustice to my own feeling not to express my confident reliance upon the disposition of each department of the government to perform its duty and to cooperate in all measure necessary in the present emergency
 the crisis undoubtedly invoke the fidelity of the patriot and the sagacity of the statesman not more in remove such portion of the public burden as may be necessary than in preserve the good order of society and in the maintenance of well regulate liberty
 while a forbear spirit may and i trust will be exercise toward the error of our brother in a particular quarter duty to the rest of the union demand that open and organize resistance to the law should not be execute with impunity
 the rich inheritance bequeath by our father have devolve upon we the sacred obligation of preserve it by the same virtue which conduct they through the eventful scene of the revolution and ultimately crown their struggle with the noble model of civil institution they bequeath to we a government of law and a federal union found upon the great principle of popular representation after a successful experiment of forty four year at a moment when the government and the union be the object of the hope of the friend of civil liberty throughout the world and in the midst of public and individual prosperity unexampled in history we be call to decide whether these law possess any force and that union the mean of self preservation the decision of this question by an enlightened and patriotic people can not be doubtful for myself fellow citizen devoutly rely upon that kind providence which have hitherto watch over our destiny and actuate by a profound reverence for those institution i have so much cause to love and for the american people whose partiality honor i with their high trust i have determine to spare no effort to discharge the duty which in this conjuncture be devolve upon i that a similar spirit will actuate the representative of the american people be not to be question and i fervently pray that the great ruler of nations may so guide your deliberation and our joint measure as that they may prove salutary example not only to the present but to future time and solemnly proclaim that the constitution and the law be supreme and the union indissoluble


fellow citizen the will of the american people express through their unsolicited suffrage call i before you to pass through the solemnity preparatory to take upon myself the duty of president of the united states for another term for their approbation of my public conduct through a period which have not be without its difficulty and for this renew expression of their confidence in my good intention i be at a loss for term adequate to the expression of my gratitude it shall be display to the extent of my humble ability in continue effort so to administer the government as to preserve their liberty and promote their happiness so many event have occur within the last four year which have necessarily call forth&mdash;sometime under circumstance the most delicate and painful&mdash;my view of the principle and policy which ought to be pursue by the general government that i need on this occasion but allude to a few lead consideration connect with some of they the foreign policy adopt by our government soon after the formation of our present constitution and very generally pursue by successive administration have be crown with almost complete success and have elevate our character among the nation of the earth to do justice to all and to submit to wrong from none have be during my administration its govern maxim and so happy have be its result that we be not only at peace with all the world but have few cause of controversy and those of minor importance remain unadjusted in the domestic policy of this government there be two object which especially deserve the attention of the people and their representative and which have be and will continue to be the subject of my increase solicitude they be the preservation of the right of the several state and the integrity of the union these great object be necessarily connect and can only be attain by an enlightened exercise of the power of each within its appropriate sphere in conformity with the public will constitutionally express to this end it become the duty of all to yield a ready and patriotic submission to the law constitutionally enact and thereby promote and strengthen a proper confidence in those institution of the several state and of the united states which the people themselves have ordain for their own government my experience in public concern and the observation of a life somewhat advanced confirm the opinion long since imbibe by i that the destruction of our state government or the annihilation of their control over the local concern of the people would lead directly to revolution and anarchy and finally to despotism and military domination in proportion therefore as the general government encroach upon the right of the state in the same proportion do it impair its own power and detract from its ability to fulfill the purpose of its creation solemnly impressed with these consideration my countryman will ever find i ready to exercise my constitutional power in arrest measure which may directly or indirectly encroach upon the right of the state or tend to consolidate all political power in the general government but of equal and indeed of incalculable importance be the union of these state and the sacred duty of all to contribute to its preservation by a liberal support of the general government in the exercise of its just power you have be wisely admonish to accustom yourself to think and speak of the union as of the palladium of your political safety and prosperity watch for its preservation with jealous anxiety discountenance whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandon and indignantly frown upon the first dawning of any attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred tie which now link together the various part without union our independence and liberty would never have be achieve without union they never can be maintain divide into 24 or even a small number of separate community we shall see our internal trade burden with numberless restraint and exaction communication between distant point and section obstruct or cut off our son make soldier to deluge with blood the field they now till in peace the mass of our people bear down and impoverish by taxis to support army and navy and military leader at the head of their victorious legion become our lawgiver and judge the loss of liberty of all good government of peace plenty and happiness must inevitably follow a dissolution of the union in support it therefore we support all that be dear to the freeman and the philanthropist the time at which i stand before you be full of interest the eye of all nation be fix on our republic the event of the exist crisis will be decisive in the opinion of mankind of the practicability of our federal system of government great be the stake place in our hand great be the responsibility which must rest upon the people of the united states let we realize the importance of the attitude in which we stand before the world let we exercise forbearance and firmness let we extricate our country from the danger which surround it and learn wisdom from the lesson they inculcate deeply impressed with the truth of these observation and under the obligation of that solemn oath which i be about to take i shall continue to exert all my faculty to maintain the just power of the constitution and to transmit unimpaire to posterity the blessing of our federal union at the same time it will be my aim to inculcate by my official act the necessity of exercise by the general government those power only that be clearly delegate to encourage simplicity and economy in the expenditure of the government to raise no more money from the people than may be requisite for these object and in a manner that will well promote the interest of all class of the community and of all portion of the union constantly bear in mind that in enter into society individual must give up a share of liberty to preserve the rest it will be my desire so to discharge my duty as to foster with our brother in all part of the country a spirit of liberal concession and compromise and by reconcile our fellow citizen to those partial sacrifice which they must unavoidably make for the preservation of a great good to recommend our invaluable government and union to the confidence and affection of the american people finally it be my most fervent prayer to that almighty be before whom i now stand and who have keep we in his hand from the infancy of our republic to the present day that he will so overrule all my intention and action and inspire the heart of my fellow citizen that we may be preserve from danger of all kind and continue forever a united and happy people
having carefully and anxiously consider all the fact and argument which have be submit to he relative to a removal of the public deposit from the bank of the united states the president deem it his duty to communicate in this manner to his cabinet the final conclusion of his own mind and the reason on which they be found in order to put they in durable form and to prevent misconception
 the president&#39;s conviction of the dangerous tendency of the bank of the united states since signally illustrate by its own act be so overpowering when he enter on the duty of chief magistrate that he feel it his duty notwithstanding the objection of the friend by whom he be surround to avail himself of the first occasion to call the attention of congress and the people to the question of its recharter the opinion express in his annual message of december 1829 be reiterate in those of december 1830 and 1831 and in that of 1830 he throw out for consideration some suggestion in relation to a substitute at the session of 1831 32 an act be pass by a majority of both houses of congress rechartere the present bank upon which the president feel it his duty to put his constitutional veto in his message return that act he repeat and enlarge upon the principle and view briefly assert in his annual message declare the bank to be in his opinion both inexpedient and unconstitutional and announce to his countryman very unequivocally his firm determination never to sanction by his approval the continuance of that institution or the establishment of any other upon similar principle
 there be strong reason for believe that the motive of the bank in ask for a recharter at that session of congress be to make it a lead question in the election of a president of the united states the ensue november and all step deem necessary be take to procure from the people a reversal of the president&#39;s decision
 although the charter be approach its termination and the bank be aware that it be the intention of the government to use the public deposit as fast as it have accrue in the payment of the public debt yet do it extend its loan from january 1831 to may 1832 from $ 42,402,304.24 to $ 70,428 070.72 be an increase of $ 28,025,766.48 in sixteen month it be confidently believe that the lead object of this immense extension of its loan be to bring as large a portion of the people as possible under its power and influence and it have be disclose that some of the large sum be grant on very unusual term to the conductor of the public press in some of these case the motive be make manifest by the nominal or insufficient security take for the loan by the large amount discount by the extraordinary time allow for payment and especially by the subsequent conduct of those receive the accommodation
 having take these preliminary step to obtain control over public opinion the bank come into congress and ask a new charter the object avow by many of the advocate of the bank be to put the president to the test that the country might know his final determination relative to the bank prior to the ensue election many document and article be print and circulate at the expense of the bank to bring the people to a favorable decision upon its pretension those whom the bank appear to have make its debtor for the special occasion be warn of the ruin which await they should the president be sustain and attempt be make to alarm the whole people by paint the depression in the price of property and produce and the general loss inconvenience and distress which it be represent would immediately follow the reelection of the president in opposition to the bank
 can it now be say that the question of a recharter of the bank be not decide at the election which ensue have the veto be equivocal or have it not cover the whole ground if it have merely take exception to the detail of the bill or to the time of its passage if it have not meet the whole ground of constitutionality and expediency then there might have be some plausibility for the allegation that the question be not decide by the people it be to compel the president to take his stand that the question be bring forward at that particular time he meet the challenge willingly take the position into which his adversary seek to force he and frankly declare his unalterable opposition to the bank as be both unconstitutional and inexpedient on that ground the case be argue to the people and now that the people have sustain the president notwithstanding the array of influence and power which be bring to bear upon he it be too late he confidently think to say that the question have not be decide whatever may be the opinion of other the president consider his reelection as a decision of the people against the bank in the concluding paragraph of his veto message he say
 i have now do my duty to my country if sustain by my fellow citizen i shall be grateful and happy if not i shall find in the motive which impel i ample ground for contentment and peace
 he be sustain by a just people and he desire to evince his gratitude by carry into effect their decision so far as it depend upon he
 of all the substitute for the present bank which have be suggest none seem to have unite any considerable portion of the public in its favor most of they be liable to the same constitutional objection for which the present bank have be condemn and perhaps to all there be strong objection on the score of expediency in rid the country of an irresponsible power which have attempt to control the government care must be take not to unite the same power with the executive branch to give a president the control over the currency and the power over individual now possess by the bank of the united states even with the material difference that he be responsible to the people would be as objectionable and as dangerous as to leave it as it be neither one nor the other be necessary and therefore ought not to be resort to
 on the whole the president consider it as conclusively settle that the charter of the bank of the united states will not be renew and he have no reasonable ground to believe that any substitute will be establish be bind to regulate his course by the law as they exist and not to anticipate the interference of the legislative power for the purpose of frame new system it be proper for he seasonably to consider the mean by which the service render by the bank of the united states be to be perform after its charter shall expire
 the exist law declare that--
 the deposit of the money of the united states in place in which the say bank and branch thereof may be establish shall be make in say bank or branch thereof unless the secretary of the treasury shall at any time otherwise order and direct in which case the secretary of the treasury shall immediately lay before congress if in session and if not immediately after the commencement of the next session the reason of such order or direction
 the power of the secretary of the treasury over the deposit be unqualified the provision that he shall report his reason to congress be no limitation have it not be insert he would have be responsible to congress have he make a removal for any other than good reason and his responsibility now cease upon the rendition of sufficient one to congress the only object of the provision be to make his reason accessible to congress and enable that body the more readily to judge of their soundness and purity and thereupon to make such further provision by law as the legislative power may think proper in relation to the deposit of the public money those reason may be very diversified it be assert by the secretary of the treasury without contradiction as early as 1817 that he have power to control the proceeding of the bank of the united states at any moment by change the deposit to the state bank should it pursue an illiberal course toward those institution that the secretary of the treasury will always be dispose to support the credit of the state bank and will invariably direct transfer from the deposit of the public money in aid of their legitimate exertion to maintain their credit and he assert a right to employ the state bank when the bank of the united states should refuse to receive on deposit the note of such state bank as the public interest require should be receive in payment of the public due in several instance he do transfer the public deposit to state bank in the immediate vicinity of branch for reason connect only with the safety of those bank the public convenience and the interest of the treasury
 if it be lawful for mr. crawford the secretary of the treasury at that time to act on these principle it will be difficult to discover any sound reason against the application of similar principle in still strong case and it be a matter of surprise that a power which in the infancy of the bank be freely assert as one of the ordinary and familiar duty of the secretary of the treasury should now be gravely question and attempt make to excite and alarm the public mind as if some new and unheard of power be about to be usurp by the executive branch of the government
 it be but a little more than two and a half year to the termination of the charter of the present bank it be consider as the decision of the country that it shall then cease to exist and no man the president believe have reasonable ground for expectation that any other bank of the united states will be create by congress
 to the treasury department be intrust the safe keeping and faithful application of the public money a plan of collection different from the present must therefore be introduce and put in complete operation before the dissolution of the present bank when shall it be commence shall no step be take in this essential concern until the charter expire and the treasury find itself without an agent its account in confusion with no depository for its fund and the whole business of the government derange or shall it be delay until six month or a year or two year before the expiration of the charter it be obvious that any new system which may be substitute in the place of the bank of the united states could not be suddenly carry into effect on the termination of its existence without serious inconvenience to the government and the people its vast amount of note be then to be redeem and withdraw from circulation and its immense debt collect these operation must be gradual otherwise much suffering and distress will be bring upon the community
 it ought to be not a work of month only but of year and the president think it can not with due attention to the interest of the people be long postpone it be safe to begin it too soon than to delay it too long
 it be for the wisdom of congress to decide upon the good substitute to be adopt in the place of the bank of the united states and the president would have feel himself relieve from a heavy and painful responsibility if in the charter to the bank congress have reserve to itself the power of direct at its pleasure the public money to be elsewhere deposited and have not devolve that power exclusively on one of the executive departments it be useless now to inquire why this high and important power be surrender by those who be peculiarly and appropriately the guardian of the public money perhaps it be an oversight but as the president presume that the charter to the bank be to be consider as a contract on the part of the government it be not now in the power of congress to disregard its stipulation and by the term of that contract the public money be to be deposit in the bank during the continuance of its charter unless the secretary of the treasury shall otherwise direct unless therefore the secretary of the treasury first act congress have no power over the subject for they can not add a new clause to the charter or strike one out of it without the consent of the bank and consequently the public money must remain in that institution to the last hour of its existence unless the secretary of the treasury shall remove it at an early day the responsibility be thus throw upon the executive branch of the government of decide how long before the expiration of the charter the public interest will require the deposit to be place elsewhere and although accord to the frame and principle of our government this decision would seem more properly to belong to the legislative power yet as the law have impose it upon the executive department the duty ought to be faithfully and firmly meet and the decision make and execute upon the good light that can be obtain and the good judgment that can be form it would ill become the executive branch of the government to shrink from any duty which the law impose on it to fix upon other the responsibility which justly belong to itself and while the president anxiously wish to abstain from the exercise of doubtful power and to avoid all interference with the right and duty of other he must yet with unshaken constancy discharge his own obligation and can not allow himself to turn aside in order to avoid any responsibility which the high trust with which he have be honor require he to encounter and it be the duty of one of the executive departments to decide in the first instance subject to the future action of the legislative power whether the public deposit shall remain in the bank of the united states until the end of its existence or be withdraw some time before the president have feel himself bind to examine the question carefully and deliberately in order to make up his judgment on the subject and in his opinion the near approach of the termination of the charter and the public consideration heretofore mention be of themselves amply sufficient to justify the removal of the deposit without reference to the conduct of the bank or their safety in its keeping
 but in the conduct of the bank may be find other reason very imperative in their character and which require prompt action development have be make from time to time of its faithlessness as a public agent its misapplication of public fund its interference in election its effort by the machinery of committee to deprive the government director of a full knowledge of its concern and above all its flagrant misconduct as recently and unexpectedly disclose in place all the fund of the bank include the money of the government at the disposition of the president of the bank as mean of operate upon public opinion and procure a new charter without require he to render a voucher for their disbursement a brief recapitulation of the fact which justify these charge and which have come to the knowledge of the public and the president will he think remove every reasonable doubt as to the course which it be now the duty of the president to pursue
 we have see that in sixteen month end in may 1832 the bank have extend its loan more than $ 28,000,000 although it know the government intend to appropriate most of its large deposit during that year in payment of the public debt it be in may 1832 that its loan arrive at the maximum and in the precede march so sensible be the bank that it would not be able to pay over the public deposit when it would be require by the government that it commence a secret negotiation without the approbation or knowledge of the government with the agent for about $ 2,700,000 of the 3 per cent stock hold in holland with a view of induce they not to come forward for payment for one or more year after notice should be give by the treasury department this arrangement would have enable the bank to keep and use during that time the public money set apart for the payment of these stock
 after this negotiation have commence the secretary of the treasury inform the bank that it be his intention to pay off one half of the 3 percent on the 1st of the succeed july which amount to about $ 6,500,000 the president of the bank although the committee of investigation be then look into its affair at philadelphia come immediately to washington and upon represent that the bank be desirous of accommodate the import merchant at new york which it fail to do and undertake to pay the interest itself procure the consent of the secretary after consultation with the president to postpone the payment until the succeed 1st of october
 conscious that at the end of that quarter the bank would not be able to pay over the deposit and that further indulgence be not to be expect of the government an agent be dispatch to england secretly to negotiate with the holder of the public debt in europe and induce they by the offer of an equal or high interest than that pay by the government to hold back their claim for one year during which the bank expect thus to retain the use of $ 5,000,000 of the public money which the government should set apart for the payment of that debt the agent make an arrangement on term in part which be in direct violation of the charter of the bank and when some incident connect with this secret negotiation accidentally come to the knowledge of the public and the government then and not before so much of it as be palpably in violation of the charter be disavow a modification of the rest be attempt with the view of get the certificate without payment of the money and thus absolve the government from its liability to the holder in this scheme the bank be partially successful but to this day the certificate of a portion of these stock have not be pay and the bank retain the use of the money
 this effort to thwart the government in the payment of the public debt that it might retain the public money to be use for their private interest palliate by pretense notoriously unfounded and insincere would have justify the instant withdrawal of the public deposit the negotiation itself render doubtful the ability of the bank to meet the demand of the treasury and the misrepresentation by which it be attempt to be justify prove that no reliance could be place upon its allegation
 if the question of a removal of the deposit present itself to the executive in the same attitude that it appear before the house of representatives at their last session their resolution in relation to the safety of the deposit would be entitle to more weight although the decision of the question of removal have be confide by law to another department of the government but the question now occurs attend by other circumstance and new disclosure of the most serious import it be true that in the message of the president which produce this inquiry and resolution on the part of the house of representatives it be his object to obtain the aid of that body in make a thorough examination into the conduct and condition of the bank and its branch in order to enable the executive department to decide whether the public money be long safe in its hand the limited power of the secretary of the treasury over the subject disable he from make the investigation as fully and satisfactorily as it could be do by a committee of the house of representatives and hence the president desire the assistance of congress to obtain for the treasury department a full knowledge of all the fact which be necessary to guide his judgment but it be not his purpose as the language of his message will show to ask the representative of the people to assume a responsibility which do not belong to they and relieve the executive branch of the government from the duty which the law have impose upon it it be due to the president that his object in that proceeding should be distinctly understand and that he should acquit himself of all suspicion of seek to escape from the performance of his own duty or of desire to interpose another body between himself and the people in order to avoid a measure which he be call upon to meet but although as an act of justice to himself he disclaim any design of solicit the opinion of the house of representatives in relation to his own duty in order to shelter himself from responsibility under the sanction of their counsel yet he be at all time ready to listen to the suggestion of the representative of the people whether give voluntarily or upon solicitation and to consider they with the profound respect to which all will admit that they be justly entitle whatever may be the consequence however to himself he must finally form his own judgment where the constitution and the law make it his duty to decide and must act accordingly and he be bind to suppose that such a course on his part will never be regard by that elevated body as a mark of disrespect to itself but that they will on the contrary esteem it the strong evidence he can give of his fix resolution conscientiously to discharge his duty to they and the country
 a new state of thing have however arise since the close of the last session of congress and evidence have since be lay before the president which he be persuade would have lead the house of representatives to a different conclusion if it have come to their knowledge the fact that the bank control and in some case substantially own and by its money support some of the lead press of the country be now more clearly establish editor to whom it loan extravagant sum in 1831 and 1832 on unusual time and nominal security have since turn out to be insolvent and to other apparently in no well condition accommodation still more extravagant on term more unusual and some without any security have also be heedlessly grant
 the allegation which have so often circulate through these channel that the treasury be bankrupt and the bank be sustain it when for many year there have not be less on an average than six million of public money in that institution might be pass over as a harmless misrepresentation but when it be attempt by substantial act to impair the credit of the government and tarnish the honor of the country such charge require more serious attention with six million of public money in its vault after having have the use of from five to twelve million for nine year without interest it become the purchaser of a bill draw by our government on that of france for about $ 900,000 be the first installment of the french indemnity the purchase money be leave in the use of the bank be simply add to the treasury deposit the bank sell the bill in england and the holder send it to france for collection and arrangement not having be make by the french government for its payment it be take up by the agent of the bank in paris with the fund of the bank in their hand under these circumstance it have through its organ openly assail the credit of the government and have actually make and persist in a demand of 15 per cent or $ 158,842.77 as damage when no damage or none beyond some trifling expense have in fact be sustain and when the bank have in its own possession on deposit several million of the public money which it be then use for its own profit be a fiscal agent of the government which thus seek to enrich itself at the expense of the public worthy of further trust
 there be other important fact not in the contemplation of the house of representatives or not know to the member at the time they vote for the resolution
 although the charter and the rule of the bank both declare that not less than seven director shall be necessary to the transaction of business yet the most important business even that of grant discount to any extent be intrust to a committee of five member who do not report to the board
 to cut off all mean of communication with the government in relation to its most important act at the commencement of the present year not one of the government director be place on any one committee and although since by an unusual remodeling of those body some of those director have be place on some of the committee they be yet entirely exclude from the committee of exchange through which the great and most objectionable loan have be make
 when the government director make an effort to bring back the business of the bank to the board in obedience to the charter and the exist regulation the board not only overrule their attempt but alter the rule so as to make it conform to the practice in direct violation of one of the most important provision of the charter which give they existence
 it have long be know that the president of the bank by his single will originate and execute many of the most important measure connect with the management and credit of the bank and that the committee as well as the board of director be leave in entire ignorance of many act do and correspondence carry on in their name and apparently under their authority the fact have be recently disclose that an unlimited discretion have be and be now vest in the president of the bank to expend its fund in payment for prepare and circulate article and purchasing pamphlet and newspaper calculate by their content to operate on election and secure a renewal of its charter it appear from the official report of the public director that on the 30th november 1830 the president submit to the board an article publish in the american quarterly review contain favorable notice of the bank and suggest the expediency of give it a wide circulation at the expense of the bank whereupon the board pass the follow resolution viz
 resolved that the president be authorize to take such measure in regard to the circulation of the content of the say article either in whole or in part as he may deem most for the interest of the bank
 by an entry in the minute of the bank date march 11 1831 it appear that the president have not only cause a large edition of that article to be issue but have also before the resolution of 30th november be adopt procure to be print and widely circulate numerous copy of the report of general smith and mr. mcduffie in favor of the bank and on that day he suggest the expediency of extend his power to the printing of other article which might subserve the purpose of the institution whereupon the follow resolution be adopt viz
 resolve that the president be hereby authorize to cause to be prepare and circulate such document and paper as may communicate to the people information in regard to the nature and operation of the bank
 the expenditure purport to have be make under authority of these resolution during the year 1831 and 1832 be about $ 80,000 for a portion of these expenditure voucher be render from which it appear that they be incur in the purchase of some hundred thousand copy of newspaper report and speech make in congress review of the veto message and review of speech against the bank etc for another large portion no voucher whatever be render but the various sum be pay on order of the president of the bank make reference to the resolution of the 11th of march 1831
 on ascertain these fact and perceive that expenditure of a similar character be still continue the government director a few week ago offer a resolution in the board call for a specific account of these expenditure show the object to which they have be apply and the person to whom the money have be pay this reasonable proposition be vote down
 they also offer a resolution rescind the resolution of november 1830 and march 1831 this also be reject
 not content with thus refuse to recall the obnoxious power or even to require such an account of the expenditure as would show whether the money of the bank have in fact be apply to the object contemplate by these resolution as obnoxious as they be the board renew the power already confer and even enjoin renew attention to its exercise by adopt the following in lieu of the proposition submit by the government director viz
 resolve that the board have confidence in the wisdom and integrity of the president and in the propriety of the resolution of 30th november 1830 and 11th march 1831 and entertain a full conviction of the necessity of a renew attention to the object of those resolution and that the president be authorize and request to continue his exertion for the promotion of say object
 take in connection with the nature of the expenditure heretofore make as recently disclose which the board not only tolerate but approve this resolution put the fund of the bank at the disposition of the president for the purpose of employ the whole press of the country in the service of the bank to hire writer and newspaper and to pay out such sum as he please to what person and for what service he please without the responsibility of render any specific account the bank be thus convert into a vast electioneer engine with mean to embroil the country in deadly feud and under cover of expenditure in themselves improper extend its corruption through all the ramification of society
 some of the item for which account have be render show the construction which have be give to the resolution and the way in which the power it confer have be exert the money have not be expend merely in the publication and distribution of speech report of committee or article write for the purpose of show the constitutionality or usefulness of the bank but publication have be prepare and extensively circulate contain the gross invective against the officer of the government and the money which belong to the stockholder and to the public have be freely apply in effort to degrade in public estimation those who be suppose to be instrumental in resist the wish of this gasping and dangerous institution as the president of the bank have not be require to settle his account no one but himself know how much more than the sum already mention may have be squander and for which a credit may hereafter be claim in his account under this most extraordinary resolution with these fact before we can we be surprised at the torrent of abuse incessantly pour out against all who be suppose to stand in the way of the cupidity or ambition of the bank of the united states can we be surprised it sudden and unexpected change of opinion in favor of an institution which have million to lavish and avow its determination not to spare its mean when they be necessary to accomplish its purpose the refusal to render an account of the manner in which a part of the money expend have be apply give just cause for the suspicion that it have be use for purpose which it be not deem prudent to expose to 39;the eye of an intelligent and virtuous people those who act justly do not shun the light nor do they refuse explanation when the propriety of their conduct be bring into question
 with these fact before he in an official report from the government director the president would feel that he be not only responsible for all the abuse and corruption the bank have commit or may commit but almost an accomplice in a conspiracy against that government which he have swear honestly to administer if he do not take every step within his constitutional and legal power likely to be efficient in put an end to these enormity if it be possible within the scope of human affair to find a reason for remove the government deposit and leave the bank to its own resource for the mean of effect its criminal design we have it here be it expect when the money of the united states be direct to be place in that bank that they would be put under the control of one man empower to spend million without render a voucher or specify the object can they be consider safe with the evidence before we that ten of thousand have be spend for highly improper if not corrupt purpose and that the same motive may lead to the expenditure of hundred of thousand and even million more and can we justify ourselves to the people by long lend to it the money and power of the government to be employ for such purpose
 it have be allege by some as an objection to the removal of the deposit that the bank have the power and in that event will have the disposition to destroy the state bank employ by the government and bring distress upon the country it have be the fortune of the president to encounter danger which be represent as equally alarming and he have see they vanish before resolution and energy picture equally appalling be parade before he when this bank come to demand a new charter but what be the result have the country be ruin or even distressed be it ever more prosperous than since that act the president verily believe the bank have not the power to produce the calamity its friend threaten the fund of the government will not be annihilate by be transfer they will immediately be issue for the benefit of trade and if the bank of the united states curtail its loan the state bank strengthen by the public deposit will extend theirs what come in through one bank will go out through other and the equilibrium will be preserve should the bank for the mere purpose of produce distress press its debtor more heavily than some of they can bear the consequence will recoil upon itself and in the attempt to embarrass the country it will only bring loss and ruin upon the holder of its own stock but if the president believe the bank possess all the power which have be attribute to it his determination would only be render the more inflexible if indeed this corporation now hold in its hand the happiness and prosperity of the american people it be high time to take the alarm if the despotism be already upon we and our only safety be in the mercy of the despot recent development in relation to his design and the mean he employ show how necessary it be to shake it off the struggle can never come with less distress to the people or under more favorable auspex than at the present moment
 all doubt as to the willingness of the state bank to undertake the service of the government to the same extent and on the same term as it be now perform by the bank of the united states be put to rest by the report of the agent recently employ to collect information and from that willingness their own safety in the operation may be confidently infer know their own resource well than they can be know by other it be not to be suppose that they would be willing to place themselves in a situation which they can not occupy without danger of annihilation or embarrassment the only consideration apply to the safety of the public fund if deposit in those institution and when it be see that the director of many of they be not only willing to pledge the character and capital of the corporation in give success to this measure but also their own property and reputation we can not doubt that they at least believe the public deposit would be safe in their management the president think that these fact and circumstance afford as strong a guaranty as can be have in human affair for the safety of the public fund and the practicability of a new system of collection and disbursement through the agency of the state bank
 from all these consideration the president think that the state bank ought immediately to be employ in the collection and disbursement of the public revenue and the fund now in the bank of the united states draw out with all convenient dispatch the safety of the public money if deposit in the state bank must be secure beyond all reasonable doubt but the extent and nature of the security in addition to their capital if any be deem necessary be a subject of detail to which the treasury department will undoubtedly give its anxious attention the bank to be employ must remit the money of the government without charge as the bank of the united states now do must render all the service which that bank now perform must keep the government advise of their situation by periodical return in fine in any arrangement with the state bank the government must not in any respect be place on a bad footing than it now be the president be happy to perceive by the report of the agent that the bank which he have consult have in general consent to perform the service on these term and that those in new york have far agree to make payment in london without other charge than the mere cost of the bill of exchange
 it should also be enjoin upon any bank which may be employ that it will be expect of they to facilitate domestic exchange for the benefit of internal commerce to grant all reasonable facility to the payer of the revenue to exercise the utmost liberality toward the other state bank and do nothing uselessly to embarrass the bank of the united states
 as one of the most serious objection to the bank of the united states be the power which it concentrate care must be take in find other agent for the service of the treasury not to raise up another power equally formidable although it would probably be impossible to produce such a result by any organization of the state bank which could be devise yet it be desirable to avoid even the appearance to this end it would be expedient to assume no more power over they and interfere no more in their affair than might be absolutely necessary to the security of the public deposit and the faithful performance of their duty as agent of the treasury any interference by they in the political contest of the country with a view to influence election ought in the opinion of the president to be follow by an immediate discharge from the public service
 it be the desire of the president that the control of the bank and the currency shall as far as possible be entirely separate from the political power of the country as well as wrest from an institution which have already attempt to subject the government to its will in his opinion the action of the general government on this subject ought not to extend beyond the grant in the constitution which only authorize congress to coin money and regulate the value thereof all else belong to the states and the people and must be regulate by public opinion and the interest of trade
 in conclusion the president must be permit to remark that he look upon the pende question as of high consideration than the mere transfer of a sum of money from one bank to another its decision may affect the character of our government for age to come should the bank be suffer long to use the public money in the accomplishment of its purpose with the proof of its faithlessness and corruption before our eye the patriotic among our citizen will despair of success in struggle against its power and we shall be responsible for entail it upon our country forever view it as a question of transcendent importance both in the principle and consequence it involve the president could not in justice to the responsibility which he owe to the country refrain from press upon the secretary of the treasury his view of the consideration which impel to immediate action upon he have be devolve by the constitution and the suffrage of the american people the duty of superintend the operation of the executive departments of the government and see that the law be faithfully execute in the performance of this high trust it be his undoubted right to express to those whom the law and his own choice have make his associate in the administration of the government his opinion of their duty under circumstance as they arise it be this right which he now exercise far be it from he to expect or require that any member of the cabinet should at his request order or dictation do any act which he believe unlawful or in his conscience condemn from they and from his fellow citizen in general he desire only that aid and support which their reason approve and their conscience sanction
 in the remark he have make on this all important question he trust the secretary of the treasury will see only the frank and respectful declaration of the opinion which the president have form on a measure of great national interest deeply affect the character and usefulness of his administration and not a spirit of dictation which the president would be as careful to avoid as ready to resist happy will he be if the fact now disclose produce uniformity of opinion and unity of action among the member of the administration
 the president again repeat that he beg his cabinet to consider the propose measure as his own in the support of which he shall require no one of they to make a sacrifice of opinion or principle its responsibility have be assume after the most mature deliberation and reflection as necessary to preserve the moral of the people the freedom of the press and the purity of the elective franchise without which all will unite in say that the blood and treasure expend by our forefather in the establishment of our happy system of government will have be vain and fruitless under these conviction he feel that a measure so important to the american people can not be commence too soon and he therefore name the 1st day of october next as a period proper for the change of the deposit or soon provide the necessary arrangement with the state bank can be make

which the united states have construct on the western side of the gulf of florida will contribute essentially to the safety of navigation in that sea this joint participation in establishment interesting to humanity and beneficial to commerce be worthy of two enlightened nation and indicate feeling which can not fail to have a happy influence upon their political relation it be gratify to the friend of both to perceive that the intercourse between the two people be become daily more extensive and that sentiment of mutual good will have grow up befit their common origin and justify the hope that by wise counsel on each side not only unsettled question may be satisfactorily terminate but new cause of misunderstanding prevent not withstand that i continue to receive the most amicable assurance from the government of france and that in all other respect the most friendly relation exist between the united states and that government it be to be regret that the stipulation of the convention conclude on 1831 07 04 remain in some important part unfulfille by the second article of that convention it be stipulate that the sum payable to the united states should be pay at paris in 6 annual installment into the hand of such person or person as should be authorize by the government of the united states to receive it and by the same article the first installment be payable on 1833 02 02 by the act of congress of 1832 07 13 it be make the duty of the secretary of the treasury to cause the several installment with the interest thereon to be receive from the french government and transfer to the united states in such manner as he may deem good and by the same act of congress the stipulation on the part of the united states in the convention be in all respect fulfil not doubt that a treaty thus make and ratify by the two government and faithfully execute by the united states would be promptly comply with by the other party and desire to avoid the risk and expense of intermediate agency the secretary of the treasury deem it advisable to receive and transfer the first installment by mean of a draft upon the french minister of finance a draft for this purpose be accordingly draw in favor of the cashier of the bank of the united states for the amount accrue to the united states out of the first installment and the interest payable with it this bill be not draw at washington until 5 day after the installment be payable at paris and be accompany by a special authority from the president authorize the cashier or his assign to receive the amount the mode thus adopt of receive the installment be officially make known to the french government by the american charg d'affaires at paris pursuant to instruction from the department of state the bill however though not present for payment until 1833 03 23 be not pay and for the reason assign by the french minister of finance that no appropriation have be make by the french chambers it be not know to i that up to that period any appropriation have be require of the chambers and although a communication be subsequently make to the chambers by direction of the king recommend that the necessary provision should be make for carry the convention into effect it be at an advanced period of the session and the subject be finally postpone until the next meeting of the chambers not withstand it have be suppose by the french ministry that the financial stipulation of the treaty can not be carry into effect without an appropriation by the chambers it appear to i to be not only consistent with the character of france but due to the character of both government as well as to the right of our citizen to treat the convention make and ratify in proper form as pledge the good faith of the french government for its execution and as impose upon each department an obligation to fulfill it and i have receive assurance through our charg d'affaires at paris and the french minister plenipotentiary at washington and more recently through the minister of the united states at paris that the delay have not proceed from any indisposition on the part of the king and his minister to fulfill their treaty and that measure will be present at the next meeting of the chambers and with a reasonable hope of success to obtain the necessary appropriation it be necessary to state however that the document except certain list of vessel capture condemn or burn at sea proper to facilitate the examination and liquidation of the reclamation comprise in the stipulation of the convention and which by the 6th article france engage to communicate to the united states by the intermediary of the legation though repeatedly apply for by the american charg d'affaire under instruction from this government have not yet be communicate and this delay it be apprehend will necessarily prevent the completion of the duty assign to the commissioner within the time at present prescribe by law the reason for delay to communicate these document have not be explicitly state and this be the more to be regret as it be not understand that the interposition of the chambers be in any manner require for the delivery of those paper under these circumstance in a case so important to the interest of our citizen and to the character of our country and under disappointment so unexpected i deem it my duty however i might respect the general assurance to which i have advert no long to delay the appointment of a minister plenipotentiary to paris but to dispatch he in season to communicate the result of his application to the french government at an early period of your session i accordingly appoint a distinguished citizen for this purpose who proceed on his mission in august last and be present to the king early in the month of october he be particularly instruct as to all matter connect with the present posture of affair and i indulge the hope that with the representation he be instruct to make and from the disposition manifest by the king and his minister in their recent assurance to our minister at paris the subject will be early consider and satisfactorily dispose of at the next meeting of the chambers as this subject involve important interest and have attract a considerable share of the public attention i have deem it proper to make this explicit statement of its actual condition and should i be disappoint in the hope now entertain the subject will be again bring to the notice of congress in such manner as the occasion may require the friendly relation which have always be maintain between the united states and russia have be far extend and strengthen by the treaty of navigation and commerce conclude on 1832 12 06 and sanction by the senate before the close of its last session the ratification having be since exchange the liberal provision of the treaty be now in full force and under the encouragement which they have secure a flourish and increase commerce yield its benefit to the enterprise of both nation afford to each the just recompense of wise measure and add new motive for that mutual friendship which the two country have hitherto cherish toward each other it afford i peculiar satisfaction to state that the government of spain have at length yield to the justice of the claim which have be so long urge in behalf of our citizen and have express a willingness to provide an indemnification as soon as the proper amount can be agree upon upon this latter point it be probable an understanding have take place between the minister of the united states and the spanish government before the decease of the late king of spain and unless that event may have delay its completion there be reason to hope that it may be in my power to announce to you early in your present session the conclusion of a convention upon term not less favorable than those enter into for similar object with other nation that act of justice would well accord with the character of spain and be due to the united states from their ancient friend it could not fail to strengthen the sentiment of amity and good will between the two nation which it be so much the wish of the united states to cherish and so truly the interest of both to maintain by the first section of an act of congress pass on 1832 07 13 the tonnage duty on spanish ship arrive from the port of spain previous to 1817 10 20 be 5 cent per ton that act be intend to give effect on our side to an arrangement make with the spanish government by which discriminate duty of tonnage be to be abolish in the port of the united states and spain on he vessel of the two nation pursuant to that arrangement which be carry into effect on the part of spain on 1832 05 20 by a royal order date 1832 04 29 american vessel in the port of spain have pay 5 cent per ton which rate of duty be also pay in those port by spanish ship but as american vessel pay no tonnage duty in the port of the united states the duty of 5 cent payable in our port by spanish vessel under the act above mention be really a discriminating duty operate to the disadvantage of spain though no complaint have yet be make on the part of spain we be not the less bind by the obligation of good faith to remove the discrimination and i recommend that the act be amend accordingly as the royal order above allude to include the port of the balearic and canary island as well as those of spain it would seem that the provision of the act of congress should be equally extensive and that for the repayment of such duty as may have be improperly receive an addition should be make to the sum appropriate at the last session of congress for refund discriminating duty as the arrangement refer to however do not embrace the island of cuba and puerto rico discriminate duty to the prejudice of american shipping continue to be levy there from the extent of the commerce carry on between the united states and those island particularly the former this discrimination cause serious injury to one of those great national interest which it have be consider an essential part of our policy to cherish and have give rise to complaint on the part of our merchant under instruction give to our minister at madrid earnest representation have be make by he to the spanish government upon this subject and there be reason to expect from the friendly disposition which be entertain toward this country that a beneficial change will be produce the disadvantage however to which our shipping be subject by the operation of these discriminating duty require that they be meet by suitable countervail duty during your present session power be at the same time vest in the president to modify or discontinue they as the discriminating duty on american vessel or their cargo may be modify or discontinue at those island intimation have be give to the spanish government that the united states may be oblige to resort to such measure as be of necessary self defense and there be no reason to apprehend that it would be unfavorably receive the propose proceeding if adopt would not be permit however in any degree to induce a relaxation in the effort of our minister to effect a repeal of this irregularity by friendly negotiation and it might serve to give force to his representation by show the danger to which that valuable trade be expose by the obstruction and burden which a system of discriminate and countervail duty necessarily produce the selection and preparation of the florida archive for the purpose of be deliver over to the united states in conformity with the royal order as mention in my last annual message though in progress have not yet be complete this delay have be produce partly by cause which be unavoidable particularly the prevalence of the cholera at havana but measure have be take which it be believe will expedite the delivery of those important record congress be inform at the opening of the last session that owing as be allege to embarrassment in the finance of portugal consequent upon the civil war in which that nation be engage payment have be make of only one installment of the amount which the portuguese government have stipulate to pay for indemnify our citizen for property illegally capture in the blockade of terceira since that time a postponement for two year with interest of the 2 remain installment be request by the portuguese government and as a consideration it offer to stipulate that rice of the united states should be admit into portugal at the same duty as brazilian rice be satisfied that no well arrangement could be make my consent be give and a royal order of the king of portugal be accordingly issue on 1833 02 04 for the reduction of the duty on rice of the united states it would give i great pleasure if in speak of that country in whose prosperity the united states be so much interested and with whom a long- subsist extensive and mutually advantageous commercial intercourse have strengthen the relation of friendship i could announce to you the restoration of its internal tranquillity subsequently to the commencement of the last session of congress the final installment payable by denmark under the convention of 1830 03 28 be receive the commissioner for examine the claim have since terminate their labor and their award have be pay at the treasury as they have be call for the justice render to our citizen by that government be thus complete and a pledge be thereby afford for the maintenance of that friendly intercourse become the relation that the two nation mutually bear to each other it be satisfactory to inform you that the danish government have recently issue an ordinance by which the commerce with the island of st. croix be place on a more liberal footing than heretofore this change can not fail to prove beneficial to the trade between the united states and that colony and the advantage likely to flow from it may lead to great relaxation in the colonial system of other nation the ratification of the convention with the king of the two sicily have be duly exchange and the commissioner appoint for examine the claim under it have enter upon the duty assign to they by law the friendship that the interest of the two nation require of they be now establish it may be hope that each will enjoy the benefit which a liberal commerce should yield to both a treaty of amity and commerce between the united states and belgium be conclude during the last winter and receive the sanction of the senate but the exchange of the ratification have be hitherto delay in consequence in the first instance of some delay in the reception of the treaty at brussels and subsequently of the absence of the belgian minister of foreign affair at the important conference in which his government be engage at london that treaty do but embody those enlarge principle of friendly policy which it be sincerely hope will always regulate the conduct of the two nation have such strong motive to maintain amicable relation toward each other and so sincerely desirous to cherish they with all the other european power with whom the united states have form diplomatic relation and with the sublime porte the good understanding prevail from all i continue to receive assurance of good will toward the united states assurance which it give i no less pleasure to reciprocate than to receive with all the engagement which have be enter into be fulfil with good faith on both side measure have also be take to enlarge our friendly relation and extend our commercial intercourse with other states the system we have pursue of aim at no exclusive advantage of deal with all on term of fair and equal reciprocity and of adhere scrupulously to all our engagement be well calculate to give success to effort intend to be mutually beneficial the war of which the southern part of this continent be so long the theater and which be carry on either by the mother country against the states which have formerly be her colony or by the states against each other having terminate and their civil dissension having so far subside as with few exception no long to disturb the public tranquillity it be earnestly hope those states will be able to employ themselves without interruption in perfect their institution cultivate the art of peace and promote by wise council and able exertion the public and private prosperity which their patriotic struggle so well entitle they to enjoy with those state our relation have under go but little change during the present year no reunion having yet take place between the states which compose the republic of colombia our charg d'affaire at bogota have be accredit to the government of new grenada and we have therefore no diplomatic relation with venezuela and equator except as they may be include in those heretofore form with the colombian republic it be understand that representative from the three statte be about to assemble at bogota to confer on the subject of their mutual interest particularly that of their union and if the result should render it necessary measure will be take on our part to preserve with each that friendship and those liberal commercial connection which it have be the constant desire of the united states to cultivate with their sister republics of this hemisphere until the important question of reunion shall be settle however the different matter which have be under discussion between the united states and the republic of colombia or either of the states which compose it be not likely to be bring to a satisfactory issue in consequence of the illness of the charg d'affaires appoint to central america at the last session of congress he be prevent from proceed on his mission until the month of october it be hope however that he be by this time at his post and that the official intercourse unfortunately so long interrupt have be thus renew on the part of the two nation so amicably and advantageously connect by engagement found on the most enlarged principle of commercial reciprocity it be gratify to state that since my last annual message some of the most important claim of our fellow citizen upon the government of brazil have be satisfactorily adjust and a reliance be place on the friendly disposition manifest by it that justice will also be do in other no new cause of complaint have arise and the trade between the two country flourish under the encouragement secure to it by the liberal provision of the treaty it be cause of regret that owing probably to the civil dissension which have occupy the attention of the mexican government the time fix by the treaty of limit with the united states for the meeting of the commissioner to define the boundary between the two nation have be suffer to expire without the appointment of any commissioner on the part of that government while the true boundary remain in doubt by either party it be difficult to give effect to those measure which be necessary to the protection and quiet of our numerous citizen reside near that frontier the subject be one of great solicitude to the united states and will not fail to receive my earnest attention the treaty conclude with chili and approve by the senate at its last session be also ratify by the chilian government but with certain additional and explanatory article of a nature to have require it to be again submit to the senate the time limit for the exchange of the ratification however having since expire the action of both government on the treaty will again become necessary the negotiation commence with the argentine republic relative to the outrage commit on our vessel engage in the fishery at the falkland islands by person act under the color of its authority as well as the other matter in controversy between the two government have be suspend by the departure of the charg d'affaires of the united states from buenos ayres it be understand however that a minister be subsequently appoint by that government to renew the negotiation in the united states but though daily expect he have not yet arrive in this country with peru no treaty have yet be form and with bolivia no diplomatic intercourse have yet be establish it will be my endeavor to encourage those sentiment of amity and that liberal commerce which belong to the relation in which all the independent states of this continent stand toward each other i deem it proper to recommend to your notice the revision of our consular system this have become an important branch of the public service in as much as it be intimately connect with the preservation of our national character abroad with the interest of our citizen in foreign country with the regulation and care of our commerce and with the protection of our sea man at the close of the last session of congress i communicate a report from the secretary of state upon the subject to which i now refer as contain information which may be useful in any inquiry that congress may see fit to institute with a view to a salutary reform of the system it give i great pleasure to congratulate you upon the prosperous condition of the finance of the country as will appear from the report which the secretary of the treasury will in due time lie before you the receipt into the treasury during the present year will amount to more than $ 32,000,000 the revenue derive from custom will it be believe be more than $ 28,000,000 and the public land will yield about $ 3,0900,000 the expenditure within the year for all object include $ 2,572,240.99 on account of the public debt will not amount to $ 25,000,000 and a large balance will remain in the treasury after satisfy all the appropriation chargeable on the revenue for the present year the measure take by the secretary of the treasury will probably enable to pay off in the course of the present year the residue of the exchange 4.5 stock redeemable on 1834 01 01 it have therefore be include in the estimated expenditure of this year and form a part of the sum above state to have be pay on account of the public debt the payment of this stock will reduce the whole debt of the united states fund and unfunded to the sum of $ 4,760,082.08 and as provision have already be make for the 4.5 stock above mention and charge in the expense of the present year the sum last state be all that now remain of the national debt and the revenue of the come year together with the balance now in the treasury will be sufficient to discharge it after meet the current expense of the government under the power give to the commissioner of the sink fund it will i have no doubt be purchase on favorable term within the year from this view of the state of the finance and the public engagement yet to be fulfil you will perceive that if providence permit i to meet you at another session i shall have the high gratification of announce to you that the national debt be extinguish i can not refrain from express the pleasure i feel at the near approach of that desirable event the short period of time within which the public debt will have be discharge be strong evidence of the abundant resource of the country and of the prudence and economy with which the government have heretofore be administer we have wage two war since we become a nation with one of the most powerful kingdom in the world both of they undertake in defense of our dear right be successfully prosecute and honorably terminate and many of those who partook in the first struggle as well as in the second will have live to see the last item of the debt incur in these necessary but expensive conflict faithfully and honestly discharge and we shall have the proud satisfaction of bequeath to the public servant who follow we in the administration of the government the rare blessing of a revenue sufficiently abundant raise without injustice or oppression to our citizen and unencumbered with any burden but what they themselves shall think proper to impose upon it the flourishing state of the finance ought not however to encourage we to indulge in a lavish expenditure of the public treasure the receipt of the present year do not furnish the test by which we be to estimate the income of the next the change make in our revenue system by the act of congress of 1832 and 1833 and more especially by the former have swell the receipt of the present year far beyond the amount to be expect in future year upon the reduce tariff of duty the shorten credit on revenue bond and the cash duty on woolens which be introduce by the act of 1832 and take effect on 1832 03 04 have bring large sum into the treasury in 1833 which accord to the credit formerly give would not have be payable until 1834 and would have form a part of the income of that year these cause would of themselves produce a great diminution of the receipt in the year 1834 as compare with the present one and they will be still more diminish by the reduce rate of duty which take place on 1834 01 01 on some of the most important and productive article upon the good estimate that can be make the receipt of the next year with the aid of the unappropriated amount now in the treasury will not be much more than sufficient to meet the expense of the year and pay the small remnant of the national debt which yet remain unsatisfied i can not therefore recommend to you any alteration in the present tariff of duty the rate as now fix by law on the various article be adopt at the last session of congress as a matter of compromise with unusual unanimity and unless it be find to produce more than the necessity of the government call for there would seem to be no reason at this time to justify a change but while i forbear to recommend any further reduction of the duty beyond that already provide for by the exist law i must earnestly and respectfully press upon congress the importance of abstain from all appropriation which be not absolutely require for the public interest and authorize by the power clearly delegate to the united states we be begin a new era in our government the national debt which have so long be a burden on the treasury will be finally discharge in the course of the ensue year no more memory will afterwards be need than what may be necessary to meet the ordinary expense of the government now then be the proper moment to fix our system of expenditure on firm and durable principle and i can not too strongly urge the necessity of a rigid economy and an inflexible determination not to enlarge the income beyond the real necessity of the government and not to increase the want of the government by unnecessary and profuse expenditure if a contrary course should be pursue it may happen that the revenue of 1834 will fall short of the demand upon it and after reduce the tariff in order to lighten the burden of the people and provide for a still further reduction to take effect hereafter it would be much to be deplore if at the end of another year we should find ourselves oblige to retrace our step and impose additional taxis to meet unnecessary expenditure it be my duty on this occasion to call your attention to the destruction of the public building occupy by the treasury department which happen since the last adjournment of congress a thorough inquiry into the cause of this loss be direct and make at the time the result of which will be duly communicate to you i take pleasure however in state here that by the laudable exertion of the officer of the department and many of the citizen of the district but few paper be lose and none that will materially affect the public interest the public convenience require that another building should be erect as soon as practicable and in provide for it it will be advisable to enlarge in some manner the accommodation for the public officer of the several departments and to authorize the erection of suitable depository for the safe keeping of the public document and record since the last adjournment of congress the secretary of the treasury have direct the money of the united states to be deposit in certain state bank designate by he and he will immediately lay before you his reason for this direction i concur with he entirely in the view he have take on the subject and some month before the removal i urge upon the department the propriety of take that step the near approach of the day on which the charger will expire as well as the conduct of the bank appear to i to call for this measure upon the high consideration of public interest and public duty the extent of its misconduct however although know to be great be not at that time fully develop by proof it be not until late in the month of august that i receive from the government director an official report establish beyond question that this great and powerful institution have be actively engage in attempt to influence the election of the public officer by mean of its money and that in violation of the express provision of its charter it have by a formal resolution place its fund at the disposition of its president to be employ in sustain the political power of the bank a copy of this resolution be contain in the report of the government director before refer to and how ever the object may be disguise by cautious language no one can doubt that this money be in truth intend for electioneer purpose and the particular use to which it be prove to have be apply abundantly show that it be so understood not only be the evidence complete as to the past application of the money and power of the bank to electioneer purpose but that the resolution of the board of director authorize the same course to be pursue in future it be thus establish by unquestionable proof that the bank of the united states be convert into a permanent electioneering engine it appear to i that the path of duty which the executive department of the government ought to pursue be not doubtful as by the term of the bank charter no officer but the secretary of the treasury could remove the deposit it seem to i that this authority ought to be at once exert to deprive that great corporation of the support and countenance of the government in such an use of its and such an exertion of its power in this point of the case the question be distinctly present whether the people of the united states be to govern through representative choose by their unbiased suffrage or whether the money and power of a great corporation be to be secretly exert to influence their judgment and control their decision it must now be determine whether the bank be to have its candidate for all office in the country from the high to the low or whether candidate on both side of political question shall be bring forward as heretofore and support by the usual mean at this time the effort of the bank to control public opinion through the distress of some and the fear of other be equally apparent and if possible more objectionable by a curtailment of its accommodation more rapid than any emergency require and even while it retain specie to an almost unprecedented amount in its vault it be attempt to produce great embarrassment in one portion of the community while through press know to have be sustain by its money it attempt by unfounded alarm to create a panic in all these be the mean by which it seem to expect that it can force a restoration of the deposit and as a necessary consequence extort from congress a renewal of its charter i be happy to know that through the good sense of our people the effort to get up a panic have hitherto fail and that through the increase accommodation which the state bank have be enable to afford no public distress have follow the exertion of the bank and it can not be doubt that the exercise of its power and the expenditure of its money as well as its effort to spread groundless alarm will be meet and rebuke as they deserve in my own sphere of duty i should feel myself call on by the fact disclose to order a scire facia against the bank with a view to put an end to the charter right it have so palpably violate be it not that the charter itself will expire as soon as a decision would probably be obtain from the court of last resort i call the attention of congress to this subject in my last annual message and inform they that such measure as be within the reach of the secretary of the treasury have be take to enable he to judge whether the public deposit in the bank of the united states be entirely safe but that as his single power might be inadequate to the object i recommend the subject to congress as worthy of their serious investigation declare it as my opinion that an inquiry into the transaction of that institution embrace the branch as well as the principal bank be call for by the credit which be give throughout the country to many serious charge impeach their character and which if true might justly excite the apprehension that they be no long a safe depository for the public money the extent to which the examination thus recommend be go into be spread upon your journal and be too well known to require to be state such as be make resulted in a report from a majority of the committee of ways and means touch certain specify point only conclude with a resolution that the government deposit might safely be continue in the bank of the united states this resolution be adopt at the close of the session by the vote of a majority of the house of representatives although i may not always be able to concur in the view of the public interest or the duty of its agent which may be take by the other department of the government or either of its branch i be not withstand wholly incapable of receive otherwise than with the most sincere respect all opinion or suggestion proceed from such a source and in respect to none be i more inclined to do so than to the house of representatives but it will be see from the brief view at this time take of the subject by myself as well as the more ample one present by the secretary of the treasury that the change in the deposit which have be order have be deem to be call for by consideration which be not affect by the proceeding refer to and which if correctly view by that department render its act a matter of imperious duty come as you do for the most part immediately from the people and the states by election and possess the full opportunity to know their sentiment the present congress will be sincerely solicitous to carry into full and fair effect the will of their constituent in regard to this institution it will be for those in whose behalf we all act to decide whether the executive department of the government in the step which it have take on this subject have be find in the line of its duty the accompanying report of the secretary of war with the document annex to it exhibit the operation of the war department for the past year and the condition of the various subject intrust to its administration it will be see from they that the army maintain the character it have heretofore acquire for efficiency and military knowledge nothing have occur since your last session to require its service beyond the ordinary routine duty which upon the sea board and the in land frontier devolve upon it in a time of peace the system so wisely adopt and so long pursue of construct fortification at expose point and of prepare and collect the supply necessary for the military defense of the country and thus providently furnish in peace the mean of defense in war have be continue with the usual result i recommend to your consideration the various subject suggest in the report of the secretary of war their adoption would promote the public service and meliorate the condition of the army our relation with the various indian tribe have be undisturbed since the termination of the difficulty grow out of the hostile aggression of the sac and fox indians several treaty have be form for the relinquishment of territory to the united states and for the migration of the occupant of the region assign for their residence west of the mississippi should these treaty be ratify by the senate provision will have be make for the removal of almost all the tribe remain e of that river and for the termination of many difficult and embarrassing question arise out of their anomalous political condition it be to be hope that those portion of two of the southern tribe which in that event will present the only remain difficulty will realize the necessity of emigration and will speedily resort to it my original conviction upon this subject have be confirm by the course of event for several year and experience be every day add to their strength that those tribe can not exist surround by our settlement and in continual contact with our citizen be certain they have neither the intelligence the industry the moral habit nor the desire of improvement which be essential to any favorable change in their condition establish in the midst of another and a superior race and without appreciate the cause of their inferiority or seek to control they they must necessarily yield to the force of circumstance and ere long disappear such have be their fate heretofore and if it be to be avert and it be it can only be do by a general removal beyond our boundary and by the reorganization of their political system upon principle adapt to the new relation in which they will be place the experiment which have be recently make have so far prove successful the emigrant generally be represent to be prosperous and content the country suitable to their want and habit and the essential article of subsistence easily procure when the report of the commissioner now engage in investigate the condition and prospect of these indians and in devise a plan for their intercourse and government be receive i trust ample mean of information will be in possession of the government for adjust all the unsettled question connect with this interesting subject the operation of the navy during the year and its present condition be fully exhibit in the annual report from the navy department suggestion be make by the secretary of various improvement which deserve careful consideration and most of which if adopt bid fair to promote the efficiency of this important branch of the public service among these be the new organization of the navy board the revision of the pay to officer and a change in the period of time or in the manner of make the annual appropriation to which i beg leave to call your particular attention the view which be present on almost every portion of our naval concern and especially on the amount of force and the number of officer and the general course of policy appropriate in the present state of our country for secure the great and useful purpose of naval protection in peace and due preparation for the contingency of war meet with my entire approbation it will be perceive from the report refer to that the fiscal concern of the establishment be in an excellent condition and it be hope that congress may feel disposed to make promptly every suitable provision desire either for preserve or improve the system the general post office department have continue upon the strength of its own resource to facilitate the mean of communication between the various portion of the union with increase activity the method however in which the account of the transportation of the mail have always be keep appear to have present an imperfect view of its expense it have recently be discover that from the early record of the department the annual statement have be calculate to exhibit an amount considerably short of the actual expense incur for that service these illusory statement together with the expense of carry into effect the law of the last session of congress establish new mail route and a disposition on the part of the head of the department to gratify the wish of the public in the extension of mail facility have induce he to incur responsibility for their improvement beyond what the current resource of the department would sustain as soon as he have discover the imperfection of the method he cause an investigation to be make of its result and apply the proper remedy to correct the evil it become necessary for he to withdraw some of the improvement which he have make to bring the expense of the department within its own resource these expense be incur for the public good and the public have enjoy their benefit they be now but partially suspend and that where they may be discontinue with the least inconvenience to the country the progressive increase in the income from postage have equal the high expectation and it afford demonstrative evidence of the grow importance and great utility of this department the detail be exhibit in the accompanying report of the postmaster general the many distressing accident which have of late occur in that portion of our navigation carry on by the use of steam power deserve the immediate and unremitting attention of the constituted authority of the country the fact that the number of those fatal disaster be constantly increase not withstand the great improvement which be every where make in the machinery employ and in the rapid advance which have make in that branch of science show very clearly that they be in a great degree the result of criminal negligence on the part of those by whom the vessel be navigate and to whose care and attention the life and property of our citizen be so extensively intrust that these evil may be greatly lessen if not substantially remove by mean of precautionary and penal legislation seem to be highly probably so far therefore as the subject can be regard as within the constitutional purview of congress i earnestly recommend it to your prompt and serious consideration i would also call your attention to the view i have heretofore express of the propriety of amend the constitution in relation to the mode of elect the president and the vice president of the united states regard it as all important to the future quiet and harmony of the people that every intermediate agency in the election of these officer should be remove and that their eligibility should be limit to one term of either 4 or 6 year i can not too earnestly invite your consideration of the subject trust that your deliberation on all the topic of general interest to which i have advert and such other as your more extensive knowledge of the want of our beloved country may suggest may be crown with success i tender you in conclusion the cooperation which it may be in my power to afford they
i have attentively consider the resolution of the senate of the 11th instant request the president of the united states to communicate to the senate a copy of the paper which have be publish and which purport to have be read by he to the head of the executive departments date the 18th day of september last relate to the removal of the deposit of the public money from the bank of the united states and its office
 the executive be a coordinate and independent branch of the government equally with the senate and i have yet to learn under what constitutional authority that branch of the legislature have a right to require of i an account of any communication either verbally or in writing make to the head of departments act as a cabinet council as well might i be require to detail to the senate the free and private conversation i have hold with those officer on any subject relate to their duty and my own
 feel my responsibility to the american people i be willing upon all occasion to explain to they the ground of my conduct and i be willing upon all proper occasion to give to either branch of the legislature any information in my possession that can be useful in the execution of the appropriate duty confide to they
 know the constitutional right of the senate i shall be the last man under any circumstance to interfere with they know those of the executive i shall at all time endeavor to maintain they agreeably to the provision of the constitution and the solemn oath i have take to support and defend it
 i be constrain therefore by a proper sense of my own self respect and of the right secure by the constitution to the executive branch of the government to decline a compliance with your request

to the senate of the united states
 it appear by the publish journal of the senate that on the 26th of december last a resolution be offer by a member of the senate which after a protract debate be on the 28th day of march last modify by the mover and pass by the vote of twenty six senator out of forty six who be present and vote in the follow word viz
 the senate order that it be not enter on the journal
 resolve that the president in the late executive proceeding in relation to the public revenue have assume upon himself authority and power not confer by the constitution and law but in derogation of both
 having have the honor through the voluntary suffrage of the american people to fill the office of president of the united states during the period which may be presume to have be refer to in this resolution it be sufficiently evident that the censure it inflict be intend for myself without notice unheard and untried i thus find myself charge on the record of the senate and in a form hitherto unknown in our history with the high crime of violate the law and constitution of my country
 it can seldom be necessary for any department of the government when assail in conversation or debate or by the stricture of the press or of popular assembly to step out of its ordinary path for the purpose of vindicate its conduct or of point out any irregularity or injustice in the manner of the attack but when the chief executive magistrate be by one of the most important branch of the government in its official capacity in a public manner and by its record sentence but without precedent competent authority or just cause declare guilty of a breach of the law and constitution it be due to his station to public opinion and to a proper self respect that the officer thus denounce should promptly expose the wrong which have be do
 in the present case moreover there be even a strong necessity for such a vindication by an express provision of the constitution before the president of the united states can enter on the execution of his office he be require to take an oath or affirmation in the following word
 i do solemnly swear or affirm that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the good of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states
 the duty of defend so far as in he lie the integrity of the constitution would indeed have result from the very nature of his office but by thus express it in the official oath or affirmation which in this respect differ from that of any other functionary the founder of our republic have attest their sense of its importance and have give to it a peculiar solemnity and force bind to the performance of this duty by the oath i have take by the strong obligation of gratitude to the american people and by the tie which unite my every earthly interest with the welfare and glory of my country and perfectly convince that the discussion and passage of the above mention resolution be not only unauthorized by the constitution but in many respect repugnant to its provision and subversive of the right secure by it to other coordinate department i deem it an imperative duty to maintain the supremacy of that sacred instrument and the immunity of the department intrust to my care by all mean consistent with my own lawful power with the right of other and with the genius of our civil institution to this end i have cause this my solemn protest against the aforesaid proceeding to be place on the file of the executive department and to be transmit to the senate
 it be alike due to the subject the senate and the people that the view which i have take of the proceeding refer to and which compel i to regard they in the light that have be mention should be exhibit at length and with the freedom and firmness which be require by an occasion so unprecedented and peculiar
 under the constitution of the united states the power and function of the various department of the federal government and their responsibility for violation or neglect of duty be clearly define or result by necessary inference the legislative power be subject to the qualified negative of the president vest in the congress of the united states compose of the senate and house of representatives the executive power be vest exclusively in the president except that in the conclusion of treaty and in certain appointment to office he be to act with the advice and consent of the senate the judicial power be vest exclusively in the supreme and other court of the united states except in case of impeachment for which purpose the accusatory power be vest in the house of representatives and that of hear and determine in the senate but although for the special purpose which have be mention there be an occasional intermixture of the power of the different department yet with these exception each of the three great department be independent of the other in its sphere of action and when it deviate from that sphere be not responsible to the other far than it be expressly make so in the constitution in every other respect each of they be the coequal of the other two and all be the servant of the american people without power or right to control or censure each other in the service of their common superior save only in the manner and to the degree which that superior have prescribe
 the responsibility of the president be numerous and weighty he be liable to impeachment for high crime and misdemeanor and on due conviction to removal from office and perpetual disqualification and notwithstanding such conviction he may also be indict and punish accord to law he be also liable to the private action of any party who may have be injure by his illegal mandate or instruction in the same manner and to the same extent as the humblest functionary in addition to the responsibility which may thus be enforce by impeachment criminal prosecution or suit at law he be also accountable at the bar of public opinion for every act of his administration subject only to the restraint of truth and justice the free people of the united states have the undoubted right as individual or collectively orally or in writing at such time and in such language and form as they may think proper to discuss his official conduct and to express and promulgate their opinion concern it indirectly also his conduct may come under review in either branch of the legislature or in the senate when act in its executive capacity and so far as the executive or legislative proceeding of these body may require it it may be exercise by they these be believe to be the proper and only mode in which the president of the united states be to be hold accountable for his official conduct
 test by these principle the resolution of the senate be wholly unauthorized by the constitution and in derogation of its entire spirit it assume that a single branch of the legislative department may for the purpose of a public censure and without any view to legislation or impeachment take up consider and decide upon the official act of the executive but in no part of the constitution be the president subject to any such responsibility and in no part of that instrument be any such power confer on either branch of the legislature
 the justice of these conclusion will be illustrate and confirm by a brief analysis of the power of the senate and a comparison of their recent proceeding with those power
 the high function assign by the constitution to the senate be in their nature either legislative executive or judicial it be only in the exercise of its judicial power when sit as a court for the trial of impeachment that the senate be expressly authorize and necessarily require to consider and decide upon the conduct of the president or any other public officer indirectly however as have already be suggest it may frequently be call on to perform that office case may occur in the course of its legislative or executive proceeding in which it may be indispensable to the proper exercise of its power that it should inquire into and decide upon the conduct of the president or other public officer and in every such case its constitutional right to do so be cheerfully concede but to authorize the senate to enter on such a task in its legislative or executive capacity the inquiry must actually grow out of and tend to some legislative or executive action and the decision when express must take the form of some appropriate legislative or executive act
 the resolution in question be introduce discuss and pass not as a joint but as a separate resolution it assert no legislative power propose no legislative action and neither possess the form nor any of the attribute of a legislative measure it do not appear to have be entertain or pass with any view or expectation of its issuing in a law or joint resolution or in the repeal of any law or joint resolution or in any other legislative action
 whilst want both the form and substance of a legislative measure it be equally manifest that the resolution be not justify by any of the executive power confer on the senate these power relate exclusively to the consideration of treaty and nomination to office and they be exercise in secret session and with closed door this resolution do not apply to any treaty or nomination and be pass in a public session
 nor do this proceeding in any way belong to that class of incidental resolution which relate to the officer of the senate to their chamber and other appurtenance or to subject of order and other matter of the like nature in all which either house may lawfully proceed without any cooperation with the other or with the president
 on the contrary the whole phraseology and sense of the resolution seem to be judicial its essence true character and only practical effect be to be find in the conduct which it enlarge upon the president and in the judgment which it pronounce on that conduct the resolution therefore though discuss and adopt by the senate in its legislative capacity be in its office and in all its characteristic essentially judicial
 that the senate possess a high judicial power and that instance may occur in which the president of the united states will be amenable to it be undeniable but under the provision of the constitution it would seem to be equally plain that neither the president nor any other officer can be rightfully subject to the operation of the judicial power of the senate except in the case and under the form prescribe by the constitution
 the constitution declare that the president vice president and all civil officer of the united states shall be remove from office on impeachment for and conviction of treason bribery or other high crime and misdemeanor that the house of representatives shall have the sole power of impeachment that the senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachment that when sit for that purpose they shall be on oath or affirmation that when the president of the united states be try the chief justice shall preside that no person shall be convict without the concurrence of two third of the member present and that judgment shall not extend far than to removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor trust or profit under the united states
 the resolution above quote charge in substance that in certain proceeding relate to the public revenue the president have usurped authority and power not confer upon he by the constitution and law and that in do so he violate both any such act constitute a high crime one of the high indeed which the president can commit a crime which justly expose he to impeachment by the house of representatives and upon due conviction to removal from office and to the complete and immutable disfranchisement prescribe by the constitution the resolution then be in substance an impeachment of the president and in its passage amount to a declaration by a majority of the senate that he be guilty of an impeachable offense as such it be spread upon the journal of the senate publish to the nation and to the world make part of our endure archive and incorporate in the history of the age the punishment of removal from office and future disqualification do not it be true follow this decision nor would it have follow the like decision if the regular form of proceeding have be pursue because the requisite number do not concur in the result but the moral influence of a solemn declaration by a majority of the senate that the accuse be guilty of the offense charge upon he have be as effectually secure as if the like declaration have be make upon an impeachment express in the same term indeed a great practical effect have be gain because the vote give for the resolution though not sufficient to authorize a judgment of guilty on an impeachment be numerous enough to carry that resolution
 that the resolution do not expressly allege that the assumption of power and authority which it condemn be intentional and corrupt be no answer to the precede view of its character and effect the act thus condemn necessarily imply volition and design in the individual to whom it be impute and be unlawful in its character the legal conclusion be that it be prompt by improper motive and commit with an unlawful intent the charge be not of a mistake in the exercise of suppose power but of the assumption of power not confer by the constitution and law but in derogation of both and nothing be suggest to excuse or palliate the turpitude of the act in the absence of any such excuse or palliation there be only room for one inference and that be that the intent be unlawful and corrupt besides the resolution not only contain no mitigating suggestion but on the contrary it hold up the act complain of as justly obnoxious to censure and reprobation and thus as distinctly stamp it with impurity of motive as if the strong epithet have be use
 the president of the united states therefore have be by a majority of his constitutional trier accuse and find guilty of an impeachable offense but in no part of this proceeding have the direction of the constitution be observe
 the impeachment instead of be prefer and prosecute by the house of representatives originate in the senate and be prosecute without the aid or concurrence of the other house the oath or affirmation prescribe by the constitution be not take by the senators the chief justice do not preside no notice of the charge be give to the accuse and no opportunity afford he to respond to the accusation to meet his accuser face to face to cross examine the witness to procure counteracting testimony or to be hear in his defense the safeguard and formality which the constitution have connect with the power of impeachment be doubtless suppose by the framer of that instrument to be essential to the protection of the public servant to the attainment of justice and to the order impartiality and dignity of the procedure these safeguard and formality be not only practically disregarded in the commencement and conduct of these proceeding but in their result i find myself convict by less than two third of the member present of an impeachable offense
 in vain may it be allege in defense of this proceeding that the form of the resolution be not that of an impeachment or of a judgment thereupon that the punishment prescribe in the constitution do not follow its adoption or that in this case no impeachment be to be expect from the house of representatives it be because it do not assume the form of an impeachment that it be the more palpably repugnant to the constitution for it be through that form only that the president be judicially responsible to the senate and though neither removal from office nor future disqualification ensue yet it be not to be presume that the framer of the constitution consider either or both of those result as constitute the whole of the punishment they prescribe the judgment of guilty by the high tribunal in the union the stigma it would inflict on the offender his family and fame and the perpetual record on the journal hand down to future generation the story of his disgrace be doubtless regard by they as the bitter portion if not the very essence of that punishment so far therefore as some of its most material part be concern the passage recording and promulgation of the resolution be an attempt to bring they on the president in a manner unauthorized by the constitution to shield he and other officer who be liable to impeachment from consequence so momentous except when really merit by official delinquency the constitution have most carefully guard the whole process of impeachment a majority of the house of representatives must think the officer guilty before he can be charge two third of the senate must pronounce he guilty or he be deem to be innocent forty six senators appear by the journal to have be present when the vote on the resolution be take if after all the solemnity of an impeachment thirty of those senators have vote that the president be guilty yet would he have be acquit but by the mode of proceeding adopt in the present case a lasting record of conviction have be enter up by the vote of twenty six senator without an impeachment or trial whilst the constitution expressly declare that to the entry of such a judgment an accusation by the house of representatives a trial by the senate and a concurrence of two third in the vote of guilty shall be indispensable prerequisite
 whether or not an impeachment be to be expect from the house of representatives be a point on which the senate have no constitutional right to speculate and in respect to which even have it possess the spirit of prophecy its anticipation would have furnish no just ground for this procedure admit that there be reason to believe that a violation of the constitution and law have be actually commit by the president still it be the duty of the senate as his sole constitutional judge to wait for an impeachment until the other house should think proper to prefer it the member of the senate could have no right to infer that no impeachment be intend on the contrary every legal and rational presumption on their part ought to have be that if there be good reason to believe he guilty of an impeachable offense the house of representatives would perform its constitutional duty by arraign the offender before the justice of his country the contrary presumption would involve an implication derogatory to the integrity and honor of the representative of the people but suppose the suspicion thus imply be actually entertain and for good cause how can it justify the assumption by the senate of power not confer by the constitution
 it be only necessary to look at the condition in which the senate and the president have be place by this proceeding to perceive its utter incompatibility with the provision and the spirit of the constitution and with the plainest dictate of humanity and justice
 if the house of representatives shall be of opinion that there be just ground for the censure pronounce upon the president then will it be the solemn duty of that house to prefer the proper accusation and to cause he to be bring to trial by the constitutional tribunal but in what condition would he find that tribunal a majority of its member have already consider the case and have not only form but express a deliberate judgment upon its merit it be the policy of our benign system of jurisprudence to secure in all criminal proceeding and even in the most trivial litigation a fair unprejudiced and impartial trial and surely it can not be less important that such a trial should be secure to the high officer of the government
 the constitution make the house of representatives the exclusive judge in the first instance of the question whether the president have commit an impeachable offense a majority of the senate whose interference with this preliminary question have for the good of all reason be studiously exclude anticipate the action of the house of representatives assume not only the function which belong exclusively to that body but convert themselves into accuser witness counsel and judge and prejudge the whole case thus present the appalling spectacle in a free state of judge go through a labored preparation for an impartial hearing and decision by a previous ex parte investigation and sentence against the suppose offender
 there be no more settle axiom in that government whence we derive the model of this part of our constitution than that the lord can not impeach any to themselves nor join in the accusation because they be judge independently of the general reason on which this rule be found its propriety and importance be greatly increase by the nature of the impeach power the power of arraign the high officer of government before a tribunal whose sentence may expel they from their seat and brand they as infamous be eminently a popular remedy a remedy design to be employ for the protection of private right and public liberty against the abuse of injustice and the encroachment of arbitrary power but the framer of the constitution be also undoubtedly aware that this formidable instrument have be and might be abuse and that from its very nature an impeachment for high crime and misdemeanor whatever might be its result would in most case be accompany by so much of dishonor and reproach solicitude and suffering as to make the power of prefer it one of the high solemnity and importance it be due to both these consideration that the impeach power should be lodge in the hand of those who from the mode of their election and the tenure of their office would most accurately express the popular will and at the same time be most directly and speedily amenable to the people the theory of these wise and benignant intention be in the present case effectually defeat by the proceeding of the senate the member of that body represent not the people but the states and though they be undoubtedly responsible to the states yet from their extended term of service the effect of that responsibility during the whole period of that term must very much depend upon their own impression of its obligatory force when a body thus constitute express beforehand its opinion in a particular case and thus indirectly invite a prosecution it not only assume a power intend for wise reason to be confine to other but it shield the latter from that exclusive and personal responsibility under which it be intend to be exercise and reverse the whole scheme of this part of the constitution
 such would be some of the objection to this procedure even if it be admit that there be just ground for impute to the president the offense charge in the resolution but if on the other hand the house of representatives shall be of opinion that there be no reason for charge they upon he and shall therefore deem it improper to prefer an impeachment then will the violation of privilege as it respect that house of justice as it regard the president and of the constitution as it relate to both be only the more conspicuous and impressive
 the constitutional mode of procedure on an impeachment have not only be wholly disregard but some of the first principle of natural right and enlighten jurisprudence have be violate in the very form of the resolution it carefully abstain from aver in which of the late proceeding in relation to the public revenue the president have assume upon himself authority and power not confer by the constitution and law it carefully abstain from specify what law or what part of the constitution have be violate why be not the certainty of the offense-- the nature and cause of the accusation --set out in the manner require in the constitution before even the humblest individual for the small crime can be expose to condemnation such a specification be due to the accuse that he might direct his defense to the real point of attack to the people that they might clearly understand in what particular their institution have be violate and to the truth and certainty of our public annal as the record now stand whilst the resolution plainly charge upon the president at least one act of usurpation in the late executive proceeding in relation to the public revenue and be so frame that those senator who believe that one such act and only one have be commit could assent to it its language be yet broad enough to include several such act and so it may have be regard by some of those who vote for it but though the accusation be thus comprehensive in the censure it imply there be no such certainty of time place or circumstance as to exhibit the particular conclusion of fact or law which induce any one senator to vote for it and it may well have happen that whilst one senator believe that some particular act embrace in the resolution be an arbitrary and unconstitutional assumption of power other of the majority may have deem that very act both constitutional and expedient or if not expedient yet still within the pale of the constitution and thus a majority of the senators may have be enable to concur in a vague and undefined accusation that the president in the course of the late executive proceeding in relation to the public revenue have violate the constitution and law whilst if a separate vote have be take in respect to each particular act include within the general term the accuser of the president might on any such vote have be find in the minority
 still far to exemplify this feature of the proceeding it be important to be remark that the resolution as originally offer to the senate specify with adequate precision certain act of the president which it denounce as a violation of the constitution and law and that it be not until the very close of the debate and when perhaps it be apprehend that a majority might not sustain the specific accusation contain in it that the resolution be so modified as to assume its present form a more striking illustration of the soundness and necessity of the rule which forbid vague and indefinite generality and require a reasonable certainty in all judicial allegation and a more glaring instance of the violation of those rule have seldom be exhibit
 in this view of the resolution it must certainly be regard not as a vindication of any particular provision of the law or the constitution but simply as an official rebuke or condemnatory sentence too general and indefinite to be easily repel but yet sufficiently precise to bring into discredit the conduct and motive of the executive but whatever it may have be intend to accomplish it be obvious that the vague general and abstract form of the resolution be in perfect keeping with those other departure from first principle and settle improvement in jurisprudence so properly the boast of free country in modern time and it be not too much to say of the whole of these proceeding that if they shall be approve and sustain by an intelligent people then will that great contest with arbitrary power which have establish in statute in bill of right in sacred charter and in constitution of government the right of every citizen to a notice before trial to a bearing before conviction and to an impartial tribunal for decide on the charge have be wage in vain
 if the resolution have be leave in its original form it be not to be presume that it could ever have receive the assent of a majority of the senate for the act therein specify as violation of the constitution and law be clearly within the limit of the executive authority they be the dismiss the late secretary of the treasury because he would not contrary to his sense of his own duty remove the money of the united states in deposit with the bank of the united states and its branch in conformity with the president&#39;s opinion and appoint his successor to effect such removal which have be do but as no other specification have be substitute and as these be the executive proceeding in relation to the public revenue principally refer to in the course of the discussion they will doubtless be generally regard as the act intend to be denounce as an assumption of authority and power not confer by the constitution or law but in derogation of both it be therefore due to the occasion that a condensed summary of the view of the executive in respect to they should be here exhibit
 by the constitution the executive power be vest in a president of the united states among the duty impose upon he and which he be swear to perform be that of take care that the law be faithfully execute be thus make responsible for the entire action of the executive department it be but reasonable that the power of appoint overseeing and control those who execute the law a power in its nature executive should remain in his hand it be therefore not only his right but the constitution make it his duty to nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate appoint all officer of the united states whose appointment be not in the constitution otherwise provide for with a proviso that the appointment of inferior officer may be vest in the president alone in the court of justice or in the head of departments
 the executive power vest in the senate be neither that of nominate nor appoint it be merely a check upon the executive power of appointment if individual be propose for appointment by the president by they deem incompetent or unworthy they may withhold their consent and the appointment can not be make they check the action of the executive but can not in relation to those very subject act themselves nor direct he selection be still make by the president and the negative give to the senate without diminish his responsibility furnish an additional guaranty to the country that the subordinate executive as well as the judicial office shall be fill with worthy and competent man
 the whole executive power be vest in the president who be responsible for its exercise it be a necessary consequence that he should have a right to employ agent of his own choice to aid he in the performance of his duty and to discharge they when he be no long willing to be responsible for their act in strict accordance with this principle the power of removal which like that of appointment be an original executive power be leave unchecked by the constitution in relation to all executive officer for whose conduct the president be responsible while it be take from he in relation to judicial officer for whose act he be not responsible in the government from which many of the fundamental principle of our system be derive the head of the executive department originally have power to appoint and remove at will all officer executive and judicial it be to take the judge out of this general power of removal and thus make they independent of the executive that the tenure of their office be change to good behavior nor be it conceivable why they be place in our constitution upon a tenure different from that of all other officer appoint by the executive unless it be for the same purpose
 but if there be any just ground for doubt on the face of the constitution whether all executive officer be removable at the will of the president it be obviate by the contemporaneous construction of the instrument and the uniform practice under it
 the power of removal be a topic of solemn debate in the congress of 1789 while organize the administrative department of the government and it be finally decide that the president derive from the constitution the power of removal so far as it regard that department for whose act he be responsible although the debate cover the whole ground embrace the treasury as well as all the other executive departments it arise on a motion to strike out of the bill to establish a department of foreign affairs since call the department of state a clause declare the secretary to be removable from office by the president of the united states after that motion have be decide in the negative it be perceive that these word do not convey the sense of the house of representatives in relation to the true source of the power of removal with the avow object of prevent any future inference that this power be exercise by the president in virtue of a grant from congress when in fact that body consider it as derive from the constitution the word which have be the subject of debate be strike out and in lieu thereof a clause be insert in a provision concern the chief clerk of the department which declare that whenever the say principal officer shall be remove from office by the president of the united states or in any other case of vacancy the chief clerk should during such vacancy have charge of the paper of the office this change having be make for the express purpose of declare the sense of congress that the president derive the power of removal from the constitution the act as it pass have always be consider as a full expression of the sense of the legislature on this important part of the american constitution
 here then we have the concurrent authority of president washington of the senate and the house of representatives number of whom have take an active part in the convention which frame the constitution and in the state convention which adopt it that the president derive an unqualified power of removal from that instrument itself which be beyond the reach of legislative authority upon this principle the government have now be steadily administer for about forty five year during which there have be numerous removal make by the president or by his direction embrace every grade of executive officer from the head of departments to the messenger of bureau
 the treasury department in the discussion of 1789 be consider on the same footing as the other executive departments and in the act establish it be incorporate the precise word indicative of the sense of congress that the president derive his power to remove the secretary from the constitution which appear in the act establish the department of foreign affairs an assistant secretary of the treasury be create and it be provide that he should take charge of the book and paper of the department whenever the secretary shall be remove from office by the president of the united states the secretary of the treasury be appoint by the president and be consider as constitutionally removable by he it appear never to have occur to anyone in the congress of 1789 or since until very recently that he be other than an executive officer the mere instrument of the chief magistrate in the execution of the law subject like all other head of departments to his supervision and control no such idea as an officer of the congress can be find in the constitution or appear to have suggest itself to those who organize the government there be officer of each house the appointment of which be authorize by the constitution but all officer refer to in that instrument as come within the appoint power of the president whether establish thereby or create by law be officer of the united states no joint power of appointment be give to the two houses of congress nor be there any accountability to they as one body but as soon as any office be create by law of whatever name or character the appointment of the person or person to fill it devolve by the constitution upon the president with the advice and consent of the senate unless it be an inferior office and the appointment be vest by the law itself in the president alone in the court of law or in the head of departments
 but at the time of the organization of the treasury department an incident occur which distinctly evince the unanimous concurrence of the first congress in the principle that the treasury department be wholly executive in its character and responsibility a motion be make to strike out the provision of the bill make it the duty of the secretary to digest and report plan for the improvement and management of the revenue and for the support of public credit on the ground that it would give the executive department of the government too much influence and power in congress the motion be not oppose on the ground that the secretary be the officer of congress and responsible to that body which would have be conclusive if admit but on other ground which concede his executive character throughout the whole discussion evince an unanimous concurrence in the principle that the secretary of the treasury be wholly an executive officer and the struggle of the minority be to restrict his power as such from that time down to the present the secretary of the treasury the treasurer register comptrollers auditor and clerk who fill the office of that department have in the practice of the government be consider and treat as on the same footing with corresponding grade of officer in all the other executive departments
 the custody of the public property under such regulation as may be prescribe by legislative authority have always be consider an appropriate function of the executive department in this and all other government in accordance with this principle every specie of property belong to the united states except that which be in the use of the several coordinate department of the government as mean to aid they in perform their appropriate function be in charge of officer appoint by the president whether it be land or building or merchandise or provision or clothing or arm and munition of war the superintendent and keeper of the whole be appoint by the president responsible to he and removable at his will
 public money be but a species of public property it can not be raise by taxation or custom nor bring into the treasury in any other way except by law but whenever or howsoever obtain its custody always have be and always must be unless the constitution be change intrust to the executive department no officer can be create by congress for the purpose of take charge of it whose appointment would not by the constitution at once devolve on the president and who would not be responsible to he for the faithful performance of his duty the legislative power may undoubtedly bind he and the president by any law they may think proper to enact they may prescribe in what place particular portion of the public property shall be keep and for what reason it shall be remove as they may direct that supply for the army or navy shall be keep in particular store and it will be the duty of the president to see that the law be faithfully execute yet will the custody remain in the executive department of the government be the congress to assume with or without a legislative act the power of appoint officer independently of the president to take the charge and custody of the public property contain in the military and naval arsenal magazine and storehouse it be believe that such an act would be regard by all as a palpable usurpation of executive power subversive of the form as well as the fundamental principle of our government but where be the difference in principle whether the public property be in the form of arm munition of war and supply or in gold and silver or bank note none can be perceive none be believe to exist congress can not therefore take out of the hand of the executive department the custody of the public property or money without an assumption of executive power and a subversion of the first principle of the constitution
 the congress of the united states have never pass an act imperatively direct that the public money shall be keep in any particular place or place from the origin of the government to the year 1816 the statute book be wholly silent on the subject in 1789 a treasurer be create subordinate to the secretary of the treasury and through he to the president he be require to give bond safely to keep and faithfully to disburse the public money without any direction as to the manner or place in which they should be keep by reference to the practice of the government it be find that from its first organization the secretary of the treasury act under the supervision of the president designate the place in which the public money should be keep and especially direct all transfer from place to place this practice be continue with the silent acquiescence of congress from 1789 down to 1816 and although many bank be select and discharge and although a portion of the money be first place in the state bank and then in the former bank of the united states and upon the dissolution of that be again transfer to the state bank no legislation be think necessary by congress and all the operation be originate and perfect by executive authority the secretary of the treasury responsible to the president and with his approbation make contract and arrangement in relation to the whole subject matter which be thus entirely committed to the direction of the president under his responsibility to the american people and to those who be authorize to impeach and punish he for any breach of this important trust
 the act of 1816 establish the bank of the united states direct the deposit of public money to be make in that bank and its branch in place in which the say bank and branch thereof may be establish unless the secretary of the treasury should otherwise order and direct in which event he be require to give his reason to congress this be but a continuation of his preexist power as the head of an executive department to direct where the deposit should be make with the superadded obligation of give his reason to congress for make they elsewhere than in the bank of the united states and its branch it be not to be consider that this provision in any degree alter the relation between the secretary of the treasury and the president as the responsible head of the executive department or release the latter from his constitutional obligation to take care that the law be faithfully execute on the contrary it increase his responsibility by add another to the long list of law which it be his duty to carry into effect
 it would be an extraordinary result if because the person charge by law with a public duty be one of his secretary it be less the duty of the president to see that law faithfully execute than other law enjoin duty upon subordinate officer or private citizen if there be any difference it would seem that the obligation be the strong in relation to the former because the neglect be in his presence and the remedy at hand
 it can not be doubt that it be the legal duty of the secretary of the treasury to order and direct the deposit of the public money to be make elsewhere than in the bank of the united states whenever sufficient reason exist for make the change if in such a case he neglect or refuse to act he would neglect or refuse to execute the law what would be the sworn duty of the president could he say that the constitution do not bind he to see the law faithfully execute because it be one of his secretaries and not himself upon whom the service be specially impose might he not be ask whether there be any such limitation to his obligation prescribe in the constitution whether he be not equally bind to take care that the law be faithfully execute whether they impose duty on the high officer of state or the low subordinate in any of the departments might he not be tell that it be for the sole purpose of cause all executive officer from the high to the low faithfully to perform the service require of they by law that the people of the united states have make he their chief magistrate and the constitution have clothe he with the entire executive power of this government the principle imply in these question appear too plain to need elucidation
 but here also we have a contemporaneous construction of the act which show that it be not understand as in any way change the relation between the president and secretary of the treasury or as place the latter out of executive control even in relation to the deposit of the public money nor on that point be we leave to any equivocal testimony the document of the treasury department show that the secretary of the treasury do apply to the president and obtain his approbation and sanction to the original transfer of the public deposit to the present bank of the united states and do carry the measure into effect in obedience to his decision they also show that transfer of the public deposit from the branch of the bank of the united states to state bank at chillicothe cincinnati and louisville in 1819 be make with the approbation of the president and by his authority they show that upon all important question appertain to his department whether they relate to the public deposit or other matter it be the constant practice of the secretary of the treasury to obtain for his act the approval and sanction of the president these act and the principle on which they be rounded be know to all the department of the government to congress and the country and until very recently appear never to have be call in question
 thus be it settle by the constitution the law and the whole practice of the government that the entire executive power be vest in the president of the united states that as incident to that power the right of appoint and remove those officer who be to aid he in the execution of the law with such restriction only as the constitution prescribe be vest in the president that the secretary of the treasury be one of those officer that the custody of the public property and money be an executive function which in relation to the money have always be exercise through the secretary of the treasury and his subordinate that in the performance of these duty he be subject to the supervision and control of the president and in all important measure have relation to they consult the chief magistrate and obtain his approval and sanction that the law establish the bank do not as it could not change the relation between the president and the secretary do not release the former from his obligation to see the law faithfully execute nor the latter from the president&#39;s supervision and control that afterwards and before the secretary do in fact consult and obtain the sanction of the president to transfer and removal of the public deposit and that all department of the government and the nation itself approve or acquiesce in these act and principle as in strict conformity with our constitution and law
 during the last year the approach termination accord to the provision of its charter and the solemn decision of the american people of the bank of the united states make it expedient and its expose abuse and corruption make it in my opinion the duty of the secretary of the treasury to place the money of the united states in other depository the secretary do not concur in that opinion and decline give the necessary order and direction so glaring be the abuse and corruption of the bank so evident its fix purpose to persevere in they and so palpable its design by its money and power to control the government and change its character that i deem it the imperative duty of the executive authority by the exertion of every power confide to it by the constitution and law to check its career and lessen its ability to do mischief even in the painful alternative of dismiss the head of one of the departments at the time the removal be make other cause sufficient to justify it exist but if they have not the secretary would have be dismiss for this cause only
 his place i supply by one whose opinion be well known to i and whose frank expression of they in another situation and generous sacrifice of interest and feeling when unexpectedly call to the station he now occupy ought forever to have shield his motive from suspicion and his character from reproach in accordance with the view long before express by he he proceed with my sanction to make arrangement for deposit the money of the united states in other safe institution
 the resolution of the senate as originally frame and as pass if it refer to these act presuppose a right in that body to interfere with this exercise of executive power if the principle be once admit it be not difficult to perceive where it may end if by a mere denunciation like this resolution the president should ever be induce to act in a matter of official duty contrary to the honest conviction of his own mind in compliance with the wish of the senate the constitutional independence of the executive department would be as effectually destroy and its power as effectually transfer to the senate as if that end have be accomplish by an amendment of the constitution but if the senate have a right to interfere with the executive power they have also the right to make that interference effective and if the assertion of the power imply in the resolution be silently acquiesce in we may reasonably apprehend that it will be follow at some future day by an attempt at actual enforcement the senate may refuse except on the condition that he will surrender his opinion to theirs and obey their will to perform their own constitutional function to pass the necessary law to sanction appropriation propose by the house of representatives and to confirm proper nomination make by the president it have already be maintain and it be not conceivable that the resolution of the senate can be base on any other principle that the secretary of the treasury be the officer of congress and independent of the president that the president have no right to control he and consequently none to remove he with the same propriety and on similar ground may the secretary of state the secretaries of war and the navy and the postmaster general each in succession be declare independent of the president the subordinate of congress and removable only with the concurrence of the senate follow to its consequence this principle will be find effectually to destroy one coordinate department of the government to concentrate in the hand of the senate the whole executive power and to leave the president as powerless as he would be useless the shadow of authority after the substance have depart
 the time and the occasion which have call forth the resolution of the senate seem to impose upon i an additional obligation not to pass it over in silence nearly forty five year have the president exercise without a question as to his rightful authority those power for the recent assumption of which he be now denounce the vicissitude of peace and war have attend our government violent party watchful to take advantage of any seeming usurpation on the part of the executive have distract our council frequent removal or force resignation in every sense tantamount to removal have be make of the secretary and other officer of the treasury and yet in no one instance be it know that any man whether patriot or partisan have raise his voice against it as a violation of the constitution the expediency and justice of such change in reference to public officer of all grade have frequently be the topic of discussion but the constitutional right of the president to appoint control and remove the head of the treasury as well as all other departments seem to have be universally concede and what be the occasion upon which other principle have be first officially assert the bank of the united states a great moneyed monopoly have attempt to obtain a renewal of its charter by control the election of the people and the action of the government the use of its corporate fund and power in that attempt be fully disclose and it be make known to the president that the corporation be put in train the same course of measure with the view of make another vigorous effort through an interference in the election of the people to control public opinion and force the government to yield to its demand this with its corruption of the press its violation of its charter its exclusion of the government director from its proceeding its neglect of duty and arrogant pretension make it in the opinion of the president incompatible with the public interest and the safety of our institution that it should be long employ as the fiscal agent of the treasury a secretary of the treasury appoint in the recess of the senate who have not be confirm by that body and whom the president might or might not at his pleasure nominate to they refuse to do what his superior in the executive department consider the most imperative of his duty and become in fact however innocent his motive the protector of the bank and on this occasion it be discover for the first time that those who frame the constitution misunderstood it that the first congress and all its successor have be under a delusion that the practice of near forty five year be but a continued usurpation that the secretary of the treasury be not responsible to the president and that to remove he be a violation of the constitution and law for which the president deserve to stand forever dishonor on the journal of the senate
 there be also some other circumstance connect with the discussion and passage of the resolution to which i feel it to be not only my right but my duty to refer it appear by the journal of the senate that among the twenty six senators who vote for the resolution on its final passage and who have support it in debate in its original form be one of the senators from the state of maine the two senators from new jersey and one of the senators from ohio it also appear by the same journal and by the file of the senate that the legislature of these states have severally express their opinion in respect to the executive proceeding draw in question before the senate
 the two branch of the legislature of the state of maine on the 25th of january 1834 pass a preamble and series of resolution in the following word
 whereas at an early period after the election of andrew jackson to the presidency in accordance with the sentiment which he have uniformly express the attention of congress be call to the constitutionality and expediency of the renewal of the charter of the united states bank and
 whereas the bank have transcend its charter limit in the management of its business transaction and have abandon the object of its creation by engage in political controversy by wield its power and influence to embarrass the administration of the general government and by bring insolvency and distress upon the commercial community and
 whereas the public security from such an institution consist less in its present pecuniary capacity to discharge its liability than in the fidelity with which the trust repose in it have be execute and
 whereas the abuse and misapplication of the power confer have destroy the confidence of the public in the officer of the bank and demonstrate that such power endanger the stability of republican institution therefore

 whereas the present crisis in our public affair call for a decide expression of the voice of the people of this state and
 whereas we consider it the undoubted right of the legislature of the several states to instruct those who represent their interest in the council of the nation in all matter which intimately concern the public weal and may affect the happiness or well being of the people therefore
 1 be it resolve by the council and general assembly of this state that while we acknowledge with feeling of devout gratitude our obligation to the great ruler of nations for his mercy to we as a people that we have be preserve alike from foreign war from the evil of internal commotion and the machination of design and ambitious man who would prostrate the fair fabric of our union that we ought nevertheless to humble ourselves in his presence and implore his aid for the perpetuation of our republican institution and for a continuance of that unexampled prosperity which our country have hitherto enjoy
 2 resolve that we have undiminishe confidence in the integrity and firmness of the venerable patriot who now hold the distinguished post of chief magistrate of this nation and whose purity of purpose and elevated motive have so often receive the unqualified approbation of a large majority of his fellow citizen
 3 resolve that we view with agitation and alarm the existence of a great moneyed incorporation which threaten to embarrass the operation of the government and by mean of its unbounded influence upon the currency of the country to scatter distress and ruin throughout the community and that we therefore solemnly believe the present bank of the united states ought not to be rechartere
 4 resolve that our senator in congress be instruct and our member of the house of representatives be request to sustain by their vote and influence the course adopt by the secretary of the treasury mr. taney in relation to the bank of the united states and the deposit of the government money believe as we do the course of the secretary to have be constitutional and that the public good require its adoption

 on the 2d of january 1834 the senate and house of representative compose the legislature of ohio pass a preamble and resolution in the following word
 whereas there be reason to believe that the bank of the united states will attempt to obtain a renewal of its charter at the present session of congress and
 whereas it be abundantly evident that say bank have exercise power derogatory to the spirit of our free institution and dangerous to the liberty of these united states and
 whereas there be just reason to doubt the constitutional power of congress to grant act of incorporation for banking purpose out of the district of columbia and
 whereas we believe the proper disposal of the public land to be of the utmost importance to the people of these united states and that honor and good faith require their equitable distribution therefore
 resolve by the general assembly of the state of ohio that we consider the removal of the public deposit from the bank of the united states as require by the good interest of our country and that a proper sense of public duty imperiously demand that that institution should be no long use as a depository of the public fund

 resolved that our senator in congress be instruct and our representatives request to use their influence to prevent the rechartering of the bank of the united states to sustain the administration in its removal of the public deposit and to oppose the passage of a land bill contain the principle adopt in the act upon that subject pass at the last session of congress
 resolve that the governor be request to transmit copy of the foregoing preamble and resolution to each of our senators and representatives
 it be thus see that four senator have declare by their vote that the president in the late executive proceeding in relation to the revenue have be guilty of the impeachable offense of assume upon himself authority and power not confer by the constitution and law but in derogation of both whilst the legislature of their respective states have deliberately approve those very proceeding as consistent with the constitution and demand by the public good if these four vote have be give in accordance with the sentiment of the legislature as above express there would have be but twenty two vote out of forty six for censure the president and the unprecedented record of his conviction could not have be place upon the journal of the senate
 in thus refer to the resolution and instruction of the state legislature i disclaim and repudiate all authority or design to interfere with the responsibility due from member of the senate to their own conscience their constituent and their country the fact now state belong to the history of these proceeding and be important to the just development of the principle and interest involve in they as well as to the proper vindication of the executive department and with that view and that view only be they here make the topic of remark
 the dangerous tendency of the doctrine which deny to the president the power of supervise directing and control the secretary of the treasury in like manner with the other executive officer would soon be manifest in practice be the doctrine to be establish the president be the direct representative of the american people but the secretary be not if the secretary fo the treasury be independent of the president in the execution of the law then be there no direct responsibility to the people in that   important branch of this government to which be commit the care of the national finance and it be in the power of the bank of the united states or any other corporation body of man or individual if a secretary shall be find to accord with they in opinion or can be induce in practice to promote their view to control through he the whole action of the government so far as it be exercise by his department in defiance of the chief magistrate elect by the people and responsible to they
 but the evil tendency of the particular doctrine avert to though sufficiently serious would be as nothing in comparison with the pernicious consequence which would inevitably flow from the approbation situational power of arraign and censure the official conduct of the executive in the manner recently pursue such proceeding be eminently calculate to unsettle the foundation of the government to disturb the harmonious action of its different department and to break down the check and balance by which the wisdom of its framer seek to insure its stability and usefulness
 the honest difference of opinion which occasionally exist between the senate and the president in regard to matter in which both be oblige to participate be sufficiently embarrassing but if the course recently adopt by the senate shall hereafter be frequently pursue it be not only obvious that the harmony of the relation between the president and the senate will be destroy but that other and graver effect will ultimately ensue if the censure of the senate be submit to by the president the confidence of the people in his ability and virtue and the character and usefulness of his administration will soon be at an end and the real power of the government will fall in to the hand of a body hold their office for long term not elect by the people and not to they directly responsible if on the other hand the illegal censure of the senate should be resist by the president collision and angry controversy might ensue discreditable in their progress and in the end compel the people to adopt the conclusion either that their chief magistrate be unworthy of their respect or that the senate be chargeable with calumny and injustice either of these result would impair public confidence in the perfection of the system and lead to serious alteration of its framework or the practical abandonment of some of its provision
 the influence of such proceeding on the other department of the government and more especially on the states could   not fail to be extensively pernicious when the judge in the last resort of official misconduct themselves overleap the bound of their authority as prescribe by the constitution what general disregard of its provision might not their example be expect to produce and who do not perceive that such contempt of the federal constitution by one of its most important department would hold out the strong temptation to resistance on the part of the state sovereignty whenever they shall suppose their just right to have be invade thus all the independent department   of the government and the state which compose our confederate union instead of attend to their appropriate duty and leave those who may offend to be reclaim or punish in the manner point out in the constitution would fall to mutual crimination and recrimination and give to the people confusion and anarchy instead of order and law until at length some form of aristocratic power would be establish on the ruin of the constitution or the states be break into separate community
 far be it from i to charge or to insinuate that the present senate of the united states intend tin the most distant way to encourage such a result it be not of their motive or design but only of the tendency of their act that it be my duty to speak   it be if possible to make senator themselves sensible of the danger which lurk under the precedent set in their resolution and at any rate to perform my duty as the responsible head of one of the coequal department of the government that i have be compel to point out the consequence to which the discussion and passage of the resolution may lead if the tendency of the measure be not check in its inception it be due to the high trust with which i have be charge to those who may be call to succeed i in it to the representative of the people whose constitutional prerogative have be unlawfully assume to the people and to the states and to the constitution they have establish that i should not permit its provision to be break down by such an attack on the executive department without at least some effort ldquo;to preserve protect and defend&rdquo they with this view and for the reason which have be state i do hereby solemnly protest against the aforementioned proceeding of the senate as unauthorized by the constitution contrary to its spirit and to several of its express provision subversive of that distribution of the power of government which it have ordain and establish destructive of the check and safeguard by which those power be intend on the one hand to be control and on the other to be protect and calculate by their immediate and collateral effect by their character and tendency to concentrate in the hand of a body not directly amenable to the people a degree of influence and power dangerous to their liberty and fatal to the constitution of their choice
 the resolution of the senate contain an imputation upon my private as well as upon my public character and as it must stand forever on their journal i can not close this substitute for that defense which i have not be allow to present in the ordinary form without remark that i have live in vain if it be necessary to enter into a formal vindication of my character and purpose from such an imputation in vain do i bear upon my person endure memorial of that contest in which american liberty be purchase in vain have i since peril property fame and life in defense of the right and privilege so dearly buy in vain be i now without a personal aspiration or the hope of individual advantage encounter responsibility and danger from which by mere inactivity in relation to a single point i might have be exempt if any serious doubt can be entertain as to the purity of my purpose and motive if i have be ambitious i should have seek an alliance with that powerful institution which even now aspire to no divided empire if i have be venal i should have sell myself to its design have i prefer personal comfort and official ease to the performance of my arduous duty i should have cease to molest it in the history of conqueror and usurper never in the fire of youth nor in the vigor of manhood could i find an attraction to lure i from the path of duty and now i shall scarcely find and inducement to commence their career of ambition when gray hair and a decay fame instead of invite to toil and battle call i to the contemplation of other world where conqueror cease to be honor and usurper expiate their crime the only ambition i can feel be to acquit myself   to he to whom i must soon render an account of my stewardship to serve my fellowman and to live respected and honor in the history of my country no the ambition which lead i on be an anxious desire and a fix determination to return to the people unimpaire the sacred trust they have confide to my charge to heal the wound of the constitution and preserve it from further violation to persuade my countryman so far as i may that it be not in a splendid government support by powerful monopoly and aristocratical establishment that they will find happiness or their liberty protection but in a plain system void of pomp protect all and grant favor to none dispense its blessing like the dew of heaven unseen and unfelt save in the freshness and beauty they contribute to produce it be such a government that the genius of our people require such an one only under which our state may remain for age to come united prosperous and free if the almighty be who have hitherto sustain and protect i will but vouchsafe to make my feeble power instrumental to such a result i shall anticipate with pleasure the place to be assign i in the history of my country and die content with the belief that i have contribute in some small degree to increase the value and prolong the duration of american liberty
 to the end that the resolution of the senate may not be hereafter draw into precedent with the authority of silent acquiescence on the part of the executive department and to the end also that my motive and view in the executive proceeding denounce in that resolution may be know to my fellow citizen to the world and to all posterity i respectfully request that this message and protest may be enter at length on the journal of the senate
to the senate of the united states
 have reason to believe that certain passage contain in my message and protest transmit to the senate on the 17th 15th instant may be misunderstood i think it proper to state that it be not my intention to deny in the say message the power and right of the legislative department to provide by law for the custody safe keeping and disposition of the public money and property of the united states
 although i be well satisfied that such a construction be not warrant by anything contain in that message yet aware from experience that detach passage of an argumentative document when disconnect from their context and consider without reference to previous limitation and the particular position they be intend to refute or to establish may be make to bear a construction vary altogether front the sentiment really entertain and intend to be express and deeply solicitous that my view on this point should not either now or hereafter be misapprehend i have deem it due to the gravity of the subject to the great interest it involve and to the senate as well as to myself to embrace the early opportunity to make this communication
 i admit without reserve as i have before do the constitutional power of the legislature to prescribe by law the place or place in which the public money or other property be to be deposit and to make such regulation concern its custody removal or disposition as they may think proper to enact nor do i claim for the executive any right to the possession or disposition of the public property or treasure or any authority to interfere with the same except when such possession disposition or authority be give to he by law nor do i claim the right in any manner to supervise or interfere with the person intrust with such property or treasure unless he be an officer whose appointment under the constitution and law be devolve upon the president alone or in conjunction with the senate and for whose conduct he be constitutionally responsible
 as the message and protest refer to may appear on the journal of the senate and remain among the record document of the nation i be unwilling that opinion should be impute to i even through misconstruction which be not entertain and more particularly be i solicitous that i may not be suppose to claim for myself or my successor any power or authority not clearly grant by the constitution and law to the president i have therefore respectfully to request that this communication may be consider a part of that message and that it may be enter therewith on the journal of the senate

resolution of the senate for the establishment of a line accord to the treaty of 1783 have not be accept by that government believe that every disposition be feel on both side to adjust this perplexing question to the satisfaction of all the party interested in it the hope be yet indulge that it may be effect on the basis of that proposition with the governments of austria russia prussia holland sweden and denmark the good understanding exist commerce with all be foster and protect by reciprocal good will under the sanction of liberal conventional or legal provision in the midst of her internal difficulty the queen of spain have ratify the convention for the payment of the claim of our citizen arise since 1819 it be in the course of execution on her part and a copy of it be now lay before you for such legislation as may be find necessary to enable those interested to derive the benefit of it yield to the force of circumstance and to the wise counsel of time and experience that power have finally resolve no long to occupy the unnatural position in which she stand to the new governments establish in this hemisphere i have the great satisfaction of state to you that in prepare the way for the restoration of harmony between those who have spring from the same ancestor who be ally by common interest profess the same religion and speak the same language the united states have be actively instrumental our effort to effect this good work will be persevere in while they be deem useful to the party and our entire disinterestedness continue to be feel and understand the act of congress to countervail the discriminating duty to the prejudice of our navigation levy in cuba and puerto rico have be transmit to the minister of the united states at madrid to be communicate to the government of the queen no intelligence of its receipt have yet reach the department of state if the present condition of the country permit the government to make a careful and enlarged examination of the true interest of these important portion of its dominion no doubt be entertain that their future intercourse with the united states will be place upon a more just and liberal basis the florida archive have not yet be select and deliver recent order have be send to the agent of the united states at havana to return with all that he can obtain so that they may be in washington before the session of the supreme court to be use in the legal question there pende to which the government be a party internal tranquillity be happily restore to portugal the distracted state of the country render unavoidable the postponement of a final payment of the just claim of our citizen our diplomatic relation will be soon resume and the long subsist friendship with that power afford the strong guaranty that the balance due will receive prompt attnetion the first installment due under the convention of indemnity with the king of the two sicilies have be duly receive and an offer have be make to extinguish the whole by a prompt payment an offer i do not consider myself authorize to accept as the indemnification provide be the exclusive property of individual citizen of the united states the original adjustment of our claim and the anxiety display to fulfill at once the stipulation make for the payment of they be highly honorable to the government of the two sicily when it be recollect that they be the result of the injustice of an intrusive power temporarily dominant in its territory a repugnance to acknowledge and to pay which would have be neither unnatural nor unexpected the circumstance can not fail to exalt its character for justice and good faith in the eye of all nation the treaty of amity and commerce between the united states and belgium bring to your notice in my last annual message as sanction by the senate but the ratification of which have not be exchange owe to a delay in its reception at brussels and a subsequent absence of the belgian minister of foreign affair have be after mature deliberation finally disavow by that government as inconsistent with the power and instruction give to their minister who negotiate it this disavowal be entirely unexpected as the liberal principle embody in the convention and which form the ground work of the objection to it be perfectly satisfactory to the belgian representative and be suppose to be not only within the power grant but expressly conformable to the instruction give to he an offer not yet accept have be make by belgium to renew negotiation for a treaty less liberal in its provision on question of general maritime law our newly establish relation with the sublime porte promise to be useful to our commerce and satisfactory in every respect to this government our intercourse with the barbary powers continue without important change except that the present political state of algiers have induce i to terminate the residence there of a salaried consul and to substitute an ordinary consulate to remain so long as the place continue in the possession of france our first treaty with one of these power the emperor of morocco be form in 1786 and be limit to fifty year that period have almost expire i shall take measure to renew it with the great satisfaction as its stipulation be just and liberal and have be with mutual fidelity and reciprocal advantage scrupulously fulfil intestine dissension have too frequently occur to mar the prosperity interrupt the commerce and distract the government of most of the nation of this hemisphere which have separate themselves from spain when a firm and permanent understanding with the parent country shall have produce a formal acknowledgment of their independence and the idea of danger from that quarter can be no long entertain the friend of freedom expect that those country so favor by nature will be distinguish for their love of justice and their devotion to those peaceful art the assiduous cultivation of which confer honor upon nation and give value to human life in the mean time i confidently hope that the apprehension entertain that some of the people of these luxuriant region may be tempt in a moment of unworthy distrust of their own capacity for the enjoyment of liberty to commit the too common error of purchase present repose by bestow on some favorite leader the fatal gift of irresponsible power will not be realize with all these government and with that of brazil no unexpected change in our relation have occur during the present year frequent cause of just complaint have arise upon the part of the citizen of the united states some time from the irregular action of the constituted subordinate authority of the maritime region and some time from the leader or partisan of those in arm against the established government in all case representation have be or will be make and as soon as their political affair be in a settle position it be expect that our friendly remonstrance will be follow by adequate redress the government of mexico make known in 1833 december last the appointment of commissioner and a surveyor on its part to run in conjunction with ours the boundary line between its territory and the united states and excuse the delay for the reason anticipate the prevalence of civil war the commissioner and surveyor not having meet within the time stipulate by the treaty a new arrangement become necessary and our charg d'affaires be instruct in 1833 january to negotiate in mexico an article additional to the pre existing treaty this instruction be acknowledge and no difficulty be apprehend in the accomplishment of that object by information just receive that additional article to the treaty will be obtain and transmit to this country as soon as it can receive the ratification of the mexican congress the reunion of the three states of new grenada venezuela and equador form the republic of colombia seem every day to become more improbable the commissioner of the two first be understand to be now negotiate a just division of the obligation contract by they when unite under one government the civil war in equador it be believe have prevent even the appointment of a commissioner on its part i propose at an early day to submit in the proper form the appointment of a diplomatic agent to venezuela the importance of the commerce of that country to the united states and the large claim of our citizen upon the government arise before and since the division of colombia render it in my judgment improper long to delay this step our representative to central america peru and brazil be either at or on their way to their respective post from the argentine republic from which a minister be expect to this government nothing far have be hear occasion have be take on the departure of a new consul to buenos ayres to remind that government that its long delay minister whose appointment have be make known to we have not arrive it become my unpleasant duty to inform you that this pacific and highly gratifying picture of our foreign relation do not include those with france at this time it be not possible that any government and people could be more sincerely desirous of conciliate a just and friendly intercourse with another nation than be those of the united states with their ancient ally and friend this disposition be found as well on the most grateful and honorable recollection associate with our struggle for independence as upon a well ground conviction that it be consonant with the true policy of both the people of the united states could not therefore see without the deep regret even a temporary interruption of the friendly relation between the two country a regret which would i be sure be greatly aggravate if there should turn out to be any reasonable ground for attribute such a result to any act of omission or commission on our part i derive therefore the high satisfaction from be able to assure you that the whole course of this government have be characterize by a spirit so conciliatory and for bear as to make it impossible that our justice and moderation should be question what ever may be the consequence of a long perseverance on the part of the french government in her omission to satisfy the concede claim of our citizen the history of the accumulated and unprovoked aggression upon our commerce commit by authority of the exist government of france between the year 1800 and 1817 have be render too painfully familiar to americans to make its repetition either necessary or desirable it will be sufficient here to remark that there have for many year be scarcely a single administration of the french government by whom the justice and legality of the claim of our citizen to indemnity be not to a very considerable extent admit and yet near a quarter of a century have be waste in ineffectual negotiation to secure it deeply sensible of the injurious effect result from this state of thing upon the interest and character of both nation i regard it as among my first duty to cause one more effort to be make to satisfy france that a just and liberal settlement of our claim be as well due to her own honor as to their incontestable validity the negotiation for this purpose be commence with the late government of france and be prosecute with such success as to leave no reasonable ground to doubt that a settlement of a character quite as liberal as that which be subsequently make would have be effect have not the revolution by which the negotiation be cut off take place the discussion be resume with the present government and the result show that we be not wrong in suppose that an event by which the two government be make to approach each other so much near in their political principle and by which the motive for the most liberal and friendly intercourse be so greatly multiply could exercise no other than a salutary influence upon the negotiation after the most deliberate and thorough examination of the whole subject a treaty between the two government be conclude and sign at paris on 1831 07 04 by which it be stipulate that the french government in order to liberate itself from all the reclamation prefer against it by citizen of the united states for unlawful seizure capture sequestration confiscation or destruction of their vessel cargoe or other property engage to pay a sum of 25,000,000 franc to the united states who shall distribute it among those entitle in the manner and accord to the rule it shall determine and it be also stipulate on the part of the french government that this 25,000,000 franc should be pay at paris in six annual installment of 4,166,666 franc and 66 centime each into the hand of such person or person as shall be authorize by the government of the us to receive it the first installment to be pay at the expiration of one year next follow the exchange of the ratification of this convention and the other at successive interval of a year one after another til the whole shall be pay to the amount of each of the say installment shall be add interest at 4 thereupon as upon the other installment then remain unpaid the say interest to be compute from the day of the exchange of the present convention it be also stipulate on the part of the united states for the purpose of be completely liberate from all the reclamation present by france on behalf of its citizen that the sum of 1,500,000 franc should be pay to the government of france in six annual installment to be deduct out of the annual sum which france have agree to pay interest thereupon be in like manner compute from the day of the exchange of the ratification in addition to this stipulation important advantage be secure to france by the follow article viz the wine of france from and after the exchange of the ratification of the present convention shall be admit to consumption in the states of the union at duty which shall not exceed the follow rate by the gallon such as it be use at present for wine in the us to wit 6 cent for red wine in cask 10 cent for white wine in cask and 22 cent for wine of all sort in bottle the proportion exist between the duty on french wine thus reduce and the general rate of the tariff which go into operation 1829 01 01 shall be maintain in case the government of the united states should think proper to diminish those general rate in a new tariff in consideration of this stipulation which shall be bind on the united states for 10 year the french government abandon the reclamation which it have form in relation to the 8th article of the treaty of cession of louisiana it engage moreover to establish on the long staple cotton of the united states which after the exchange of the ratification of the present convention shall be bring directly thence to france by the vessel of the us or by french vessel the same duty as on short staple cotton this treaty be duly ratify in the manner prescribe by the constitution of both country and the ratification be exchange at the city of washington on 1832 02 02 on account of its commercial stipulation it be in five day thereafter lay before the congress of the united states which proceed to enact such law favorable to the commerce of france as be necessary to carry it into full execution and france have from that period to the present be in the unrestricted enjoyment of the valuable privilege that be thus secure to she the faith of the french nation having be thus solemnly pledge through its constitutional organ for the liquidation and ultimate payment of the long defer claim of our citizen as also for the adjustment of other point of great and reciprocal benefit to both country and the united states have with a fidelity and promptitude by which their conduct will i trust be always characterize do every thing that be necessary to carry the treaty into full and fair effect on their part count with the most perfect confidence on equal fidelity and promptitude on the part of the french government in this reasonable expectation we have be i regret to inform you wholly disappointed no legislative provision have be make by france for the execution of the treaty either as it respect the indemnity to be pay or the commercial benefit to be secure to the united states and the relation between the united states and that power in consequence thereof be place in a situation threaten to interrupt the good understanding which have so long and so happily exist between the two nation not only have the french government been thus want in the performance of the stipulation it have so solemnly enter into with the united states but its omission have be mark by circumstance which would seem to leave we without satisfactory evidence that such performance will certainly take place at a future period advice of the exchange of ratification reach paris prior to 1832 04 08 the french chambers be then sit and continue in session until 1832 04 21 and although one installment of the indemnity be payable on 1833 02 02 one year after the exchange of ratification no application be make to the chambers for the require appropriation and in consequence of no appropriation having then be make the draft of the united states government for that installment be dishonor by the minister of finance and the united states thereby involve in much controversy the next session of the chambers commence on 1832 11 19 and continue until 1833 04 25 not withstand the omission to pay the first installment have be make the subject of earnest remonstrance on our part the treaty with the united states and a bill make the necessary appropriation to execute it be not lay before the chamber of deputies until 1833 04 06 nearly five month after its meeting and only nineteen day before the close of the session the bill be read and refer to a committee but there be no further action upon it the next session of the chambers commence on 1833 04 26 and continue until 1833 06 26 a new bill be introduce on 1833 06 11 but nothing important be do in relation to it during the session in 1834 april nearly three year after the signature of the treaty the final action of the french chambers upon the bill to carry the treaty into effect be obtain and result in a refusal of the necessary appropriation the avow ground upon which the bill be reject be to be find in the publish debate of that body and no observation of mine can be necessary to satisfy congress of their utter insufficiency although the gross amount of the claim of our citizen be probably great than will be ultimately allow by the commissioner sufficient be never the less show to render it absolutely certain that the indemnity fall far short of the actual amount of our just claim independently of the question of damage and interest for the detention that the settlement involve a sacrifice in this respect be well know at the time a sacrifice which be cheerfully acquiesce in by the different branch of the federal government whose action upon the treaty be require from a sincere desire to avoid further collision upon this old and disturbing subject and in the confident expectation that the general relation between the two country would be improve thereby the refusal to vote the appropriation the news of which be receive from our minister in paris about 1834 05 15 might have be consider the final determination of the french government not to execute the stipulation of the treaty and would have justify an immediate communication of the fact to congress with a recommendation of such ultimate measure as the interest and honor of the united states might seem to require but with the news of the refusal of the chambers to make the appropriation be convey the regret of the king and a declaration that a national vessel should be forthwith send out with instruction to the french minister to give the most ample explanation of the past and the strong assurance for the future after a long passage the promise dispatch vessel arrive the pledge give by the french minister upon receipt of his instruction be that as soon after the election of the new member as the charter would permit the legislative chambers of france should be call together and the proposition for an appropriation lay before they that all the constitutional power of the king and his cabinet should be exert to accomplish the object and that the result should be make known early enough to be communicate to congress at the commencement of the present session rely upon these pledge and not doubt that the acknowledge justice of our claim the promise exertion of the king and his cabinet and above all that sacred regard for the national faith and honor for which the french character have be so distinguished would secure an early execution of the treaty in all its part i do not deem it necessary to call the attention of congress to the subject at the last session i regret to say that the pledge make through the minister of france have not be redeem the new chambers meet on 1834 07 31 and although the subject of fulfil treaty be allude to in the speech from the throne no attempt be make by the king or his cabinet to procure an appropriation to carry it into execution the reason give for this omission although they might be consider sufficient in an ordinary case be not consistent with the expectation found upon the assurance give here for there be no constitutional obstacle to enter into legislative business at the first meeting of the chambers this point however might have be over look have not the chambers instead of be call to meet at so early a day that the result of their deliberation might be communicate to i before the meeting of congress be prorogue to 1834 12 29 a period so late that their decision can scarcely be make known to the present congress prior to its dissolution to avoid this delay our minister in paris in virtue of the assurance give by the french minister in the united states strongly urge the convocation of the chambers at an early day but without success it be proper to remark however that this refusal have be accompany with the most positive assurance on the part of the executive government of france of their intention to press the appropriation at the ensue session of the chambers the executive branch of this government have as matter stand exhaust all the authority upon the subject with which it be invest and which it have any reason to believe could be beneficially employ the idea of acquiesce in the refusal to execute the treaty will not i be confident be for a moment entertain by any branch of this government and further negotiation upon the subject be equally out of the question if it shall be the pleasure of congress to await the further action of the french chambers no further consideration of the subject will at this session probably be require at your hand but if from the original delay in ask for an appropriation from the refusal of the chambers to grant it when ask from the omission to bring the subject before the chambers at their last session from the fact that include that session there have be five different occasion when the appropriation might have be make and from the delay in convoke the chambers until some week after the meeting of congress when it be well know that a communication of the whole subject to congress at the last session be prevent by assurance that it should be dispose of before its present meeting you should feel yourself constrain to doubt whether it be the intention of the french government in all its branch to carry the treaty into effect and think that such measure as the occasion may be deem to call for should be now adopt the important question arise what those measure shall be our institution be essentially pacific peace and friendly intercourse with all nation be as much the desire of our government as they be the interest of our people but these object be not to be permanently secure by surrender the right of our citizen or permit solemn treaty for their indemnity in case of flagrant wrong to be abrogate or set aside it be undoubtedly in the power of congress seriously to affect the agricultural and manufacturing interest of france by the passage of law relate to her trade with the united states her product manufacture and tonnage may be subject to heavy duty in our port or all commercial intercourse with she may be suspend but there be powerful and to my mind conclusive objection to this mode of proceed we can not embarrass or cut off the trade of france without at the same time in some degree embarrassing or cut off our own trade the injury of such a warfare must fall though unequally upon our own citizen and could not but impair the mean of the government and weaken that united sentiment in support of the right and honor of the nation which must now pervade every bosom nor be it impossible that such a course of legislation would introduce once more into our national council those disturbing question in relation to the tariff of duty which have be so recently put to rest besides by every measure adopt by the government of the united sstates with the view of injure france the clear perception of right which will induce our own people and the ruler and people of all other nation even of france herself to pronounce our quarrel just will be obscure and the support render to we in a final resort to more decisive measure will be more limited and equivocal there be but one point of controversy and upon that the whole civilized world must pronounce france to be in the wrong we insist that she shall pay we a sum of money which she have acknowledge to be due and of the justice of this demand there can be but one opinion among mankind true policy would seem to dictate that the question at issue should be keep thus disencumber and that not the slight pretense should be give to france to persist in her refusal to make payment by any act on our part affect the interest of her people the question should be leave as it be now in such an attitude that when france fulfill her treaty stipulation all controversy will be at an end it be my conviction that the united states ought to insist on a prompt execution of the treaty and in case it be refuse or long delay take redress into their own hand after the delay on the part of france of a quarter of a century in acknowledge these claim by treaty it be not to be tolerate that another quarter of a century be to be waste in negotiate about the payment the law of nation provide a remedy for such occasion it be a well settle principle of the international code that where one nation owe another a liquidate debt which it refuse or neglect to pay the aggrieved party may seize on the property belong to the other its citizen or subject sufficient to pay the debt without give just cause of war this remedy have be repeatedly resort to and recently by france herself toward portugal under circumstance less unquestionable the time at which resort should be have to this or any other mode of redress be a point to be decide by congress if an appropriation shall not be make by the french chambers at their next session it may justly be conclude that the government of france have finally determine to disregard its own solemn undertaking and refuse to pay an acknowledge debt in that event every day 's delay on our part will be a stain upon our national honor as well as a denial of justice to our injure citizen prompt measure when the refusal of france shall be complete will not only be most honorable and just but will have the good effect upon our national character since france in violation of the pledge give through her minister here have delay her final action so long that her decision will not probably be know in time to be communicate to this congress i recommend that a law be pass authorize reprisal upon french property in case provision shall not be make for the payment of the debt at the approach session of the french chambers her pride and power be too well known to expect any thing from her fear and preclude the necessity of a declaration that nothing partake of the character of intimidation be intend by we she ought to look upon it as the evidence only of an inflexible determination on the part of the united states to insist on their right that government by do only what it have itself acknowledge to be just will be able to spare the united states the necessity of take redress into their own hand and save the property of french citizen from that seizure and sequestration which american citizen so long endure without retaliation or redress if she should continue to refuse that act of acknowledge justice and in violation of the law of nation make reprisal on our part the occasion of hostility against the united states she would but add violence to injustice and could not fail to expose herself to the just censure of civilized nation and to the retributive judgment of heaven collision with france be the more to be regret on account of the position she occupy in europe in relation to liberal institution but in maintain our national right and honor all government be alike to we if by a collision with france in a case where she be clearly in the wrong the march of liberal principle shall be impede the responsibility for that result as well as every other will rest on her own head having submit these consideration it belong to congress to decide whether after what have take place it will still await the further action of the french chambers or now adopt such provisional measure as it may deem necessary and well adapt to protect the right and maintain the honor of the country what ever that decision may be it will be faithfully enforce by the executive as far as he be authorize so to do accord to the estimate of the treasury department the revenue accrue from all source during the present year will amount to $ 20,624,717 which with the balance remain in the treasury on 1834 01 01 of $ 11,702,905 produce an aggregate of $ 32,327,623 the total expenditure during the year for all object include the public debt be estimate at $ 25,591,390 which will leave a balance in the treasury on 1835 01 01 of $ 6,736,232 in this balance however will be include about $ 1,150,000 of what be heretofore report by the department as not effective of former appropriation it be estimate that there will remain unexpended at the close of the year $ 8,002,925 and that of this sum there will not be require more than $ 5,141,964 to accomplish the object of all the current appropriation thus it appear that after satisfy all those appropriation and after discharge the last item of our public debt which will be do on 1835 01 01 there will remain unexpended in the treasury an effective balance of about $ 440,000 that such should be the aspect of our finance be highly flattering to the industry and enterprise of our population and auspicious of the wealth and prosperity which await the future cultivation of their grow resource it be not deem prudent however to recommend any change for the present in our impost rate the effect of the gradual reduction now in progress in many of they not be sufficiently test to guide we in determine the precise amount of revenue which they will produce free from public debt at peace with all the world and with no complicated interest to consult in our intercourse with foreign power the present may be hail as the epoch in our history the most favorable for the settlement of those principle in our domestic policy which shall be well calculate to give stability to our republic and secure the blessing of freedom to our citizen among these principle from our past experience it can not be doubt that simplicity in the character of the federal government and a rigid economy in its administration should be regard as fundamental and sacred all must be sensible that the existence of the public debt by render taxation necessary for its extinguishment have increase the difficulty which be inseparable from every exercise of the tax power and that it be in this respect a remote agent in produce those disturbing question which grow out of the discussion relate to the tariff if such have be the tendency of a debt incur in the acquisition and maintenance of our national right and liberty the obligation of which all portion of the union cheerfully acknowledge it must be obvious that what ever be calculate to increase the burden of government without necessity must be fatal to all our hope of preserve its true character while we be felicitate ourselves therefore upon the extinguishment of the national debt and the prosperous state of our finance let we not be tempt to depart from those sound maxim of public policy which enjoin a just adaptation of the revenue to the expenditure that be consistent with a rigid economy and an entire abstinence from all topic of legislation that be not clearly within the constitutional power of the government and suggest by the want of the country properly regard under such a policy every diminution of the public burden arise from taxation give to individual enterprise increase power and furnish to all the member of our happy confederacy new motive for patriotic affection and support but above all its most important effect will be find in its influence upon the character of the government by confine its action to those object which will be sure to secure to it the attachment and support of our fellow citizen circumstance make it my duty to call the attention of congress to the bank of the united states create for the convenience of the government that institution have become the scourge of the people its interference to postpone the payment of a portion of the national debt that it might retain the public money appropriate for that purpose to strengthen it in a political contest the extraordinary extension and contraction of its accommodation to the community its corrupt and partisan loan its exclusion of the public director from a knowledge of its most important proceeding the unlimited authority confer on the president to expend its fund in hire writer and procure the execution of printing and the use make of that authority the retention of the pension money and book after the selection of new agent the groundless claim to heavy damage in consequence of the protest of the bill draw on the french government have through various channel be lay before congress immediately after the close of the last session the bank through its president announce its ability and readiness to abandon the system of unparalleled curtailment and the interruption of domestic exchange which it have practice upon from 1833 08 01 to 1834 06 30 and to extend its accommodation to the community the ground assume in this annunciation amount to an acknowledgment that the curtailment in the extent to which it have be carry be not necessary to the safety of the bank and have be persist in merely to induce congress to grant the prayer of the bank in its memorial relative to the removal of the deposit and to give it a new charter they be substantially a confession that all the real distress which individual and the country have endure for the precede 6 or 8 month have be needlessly produce by it with the view of affect through the suffering of the people the legislative action of congress it be subject of congratulation that congress and the country have the virtue and firmness to bear the infliction that the energy of our people soon find relief from this wanton tyranny in vast importation of th eprecious metal from almost every part of the world and that at the close of this tremendous effort to control our government the bank find itself powerless and no long able to loan out its surplus mean the community have learn to manage its affair without its assistance and trade have already find new auxiliary so that on 1834 10 01 the extraordinary spectacle be present of a national more than half of whose capital be either lie unproductive in its vault or in the hand of foreign banker to the needless distress bring on the country during the last session of congress have since be add the open seizure of the dividend on the public stock to the amount of $ 170,041 under pretense of pay damage cost and interest upon the protest french bill this sum constitute a portion of the estimate revenue for the year 1834 upon which the appropriation make by congress be base it would as soon have be expect that our collector would seize on the custom or the receiver of our land office on the money arise from the sale of public land under pretense of claim against the united states as that the bank would have retain the dividend indeed if the principle be establish that any one who choose to set up a claim against the united states may without authority of law seize on the public property or money wherever he can find it to pay such claim there will remain no assurance that our revenue will reach the treasury or that it will be apply after the appropriation to the purpose designate in the law the pay master of our army and the purser of our navy may under like pretense apply to their own use money appropriate to set in motion the public force and in time of war leave the country without defense this measure resort to by the bank be disorganize and revolutionary and if generally resort to by private citizen in like case would fill the land with anarchy and violence it be a constitutional provision that no money shall be draw from the treasury but in consequence of appropriation make by law the palpable object of this provision be to prevent the expenditure of the public money for any purpose what so ever which shall not have be 1st approve by the representative of the people and the states in congress assemble it vest the power of declare for what purpose the public money shall be expend in the legislative department of the government to the exclusion of the executive and judicial and it be not within the constitutional authority of either of those department to pay it away without law or to sanction its payment accord to this plain constitutional provision the claim of the bank can never be pay without an appropriation by act of congress but the bank have never ask for an appropriation it attempt to defeat the provision of the constitution and obtain payment without an act of congress instead of await an appropriation pass by both houses and approve by the president it make an appropriation for itself and invite an appeal to the judiciary to sanction it that the money have not technically be pay into the treasury do not affect the principle intend to be establish by the constitution the executive and the judiciary have as little right to appropriate and expend the public money without authority of law before it be place to the credit of the treasury as to take it from the treasury in the annual report of the secretary of the treasury and in his correspondence with the president of the bank and the opinion of the attorney general accompany it you will find a further examination of the claim of the bank and the course it have pursue it seem due to the safety of the people fund remain in that bank and to the honor of the american people that measure be take to separate the government entirely from an institution so mischievous to the public prosperity and so regardless of the constitution and law by transfer the public deposit by appoint other pension agent as far as it have the power by order the discontinuance of the receipt of bank check in the payment of the public due after 1834 01 01 the executive have exert all its lawful authority to sever the connection between the government and this faithless corporation the high handed career of this institution impose upon the constitutional functionary of this government duty of the grave and most imperative character duty which they can not avoid and from which i trust there will be no inclination on the part of any of they to shrink my own sense of they be most clear as be also my readiness to discharge those which may rightfully fall on i to continue any business relation with the bank of the united states that may be avoid without a violation of the national faith after that institution have set at open defiance the concede right of the government to examine its affair after it have do all in its power to deride the public authority in other respect and to bring it into disrepute at home and abroad after it have attempt to defeat the clearly express will of the people by turn against they the immense power intrust to its hand and by involve a country otherwise peaceful flourish and happy in dissension embarrassment and distress would make the nation itself a party to the degradation so sedulously prepare for itss public agent and do much to destroy the confidence of man kind in popular government and to bring into contempt their authority and efficiency in guard against an evil of such magnitude consideration of temprary convenience should be throw out of the question and we should be influence by such motive only as look to the honor and preservation of the republican system deeply and solemnly impress with the justice of these view i feel it to be my duty to recommend to you that a law be pass authorize the sale of the public stock that the provision of the charter require the receipt of note of the bank in payment of public due shall in accordance with the power reserve to congress in the 14th section of the charter be suspend until the bank pay to the treasury the dividend withhold and that all law connect the government or its officer with the bank directly or indirectly be repeal and that the institution be leave hereafter to its own resource and mean event have satisfy my mind and i think the mind of the american people that the mischief and danger which flow from a national bank far over balance all its advantage the bold effort the present bank have make to control the government the distress it have wantonly produce the violence of which it have be the occasion in one of our city fame for its observance of law and order be but premonition of the fate which await the american people should they be delude into a perpetuation of this institution or the establishment of another like it it be fervently hope that thus admonish those who have heretofore favor the establishment of a substitute for the present bank will be induce to abandon it as it be evidently well to incur any inconvenience that may be reasonably expect than to concentrate the whole moneyed power of the republic in any form what so ever or under any restriction happily it be already illustrate that the agency of such an institution be not necessary to the fiscal operation of the government the state bank be find fully adequate to the performance of all service which be require of the bank of the united states quite as promptly and with the same cheapness they have maintain themselves and discharge all these duty while the bank of the united states be still powerful and in the field as an open enemy and it be not possible to conceive that they will find great difficulty in their operation when that enemy shall cease to exist the attention of congress be earnestly invite to the regulation of the deposit in the state bank by law although the power now exercise by the executive department in this behalf be only such as be uniformly exert through every administration from the origin of the government up to the establishment of the present bank yet it be one which be susceptible of regulation by law and therefore ought so to be regulate the power of congress to direct in what place the treasurer shall keep the money in the treasury and to impose restriction upon the executive authority in relation to their custody and removal be unlimited and its exercise will rather be court than discourage by those public officer and agent on whom rest the responsibility for their safety it be desirable that as little power as possible should be leave to the president or the secretary of the treasury over those institution which be thus free from executive influence and without a common head to direct their operation would have neither the temptation nor the ability to interfere in the political conflict of the country not derive their charter from the national authority they would never have those inducement to meddle in general election which have lead the bank of the united states to agitate and convulse the country for upward of two year the progress of our gold coinage be creditable to the officer of the mint and promise in a short period to furnish the country with a sound and portable currency which will much diminish the inconvenience to traveler of the want of a general paper currency should the state bank be incapable of furnish it those institution have already show themselves competent to purchase and furnish domestic exchange for the convenience of trade at reasonable rate and not a doubt be entertain that in a short period all the want of the country in bank accommodation and exchange will be supplid as promptly and as cheaply as they have heretofore be by the bank of the united states if the several state shall be induce gradually to reform their banking system and prohibit the issue of all small note we shall in a few year have a currency as sound and as little liable to fluctuation as any other commercial country the report of the secretary of war together with the accompany document from the several bureaux of that department will exhibit the situation of the various object commit to its administration no event have occur since your last session render necessary any movement of the army with the exception of the expedition of the regiment of dragoon into the territory of the wandering and predatory tribe inhabit the western frontier and living adjacent to the mexican boundary these tribe have be heretofore know to we principally by their attack upon our own citizen and upon other indians entitle to the protection of the united states it become necessary for the peace of the frontier to check these habitual inroad and i be happy to inform you that the object have be effect without the commission of any act of hostility colonel dodge and the troop under his command have act with equal firmness and humanity and an arrangement have be make with those indians which it be hope will assure their permanent pacific relation with the united states and the other tribe of indians upon that border it be to be regret that the prevalence of sickness in that quarter have deprive the country of a number of valuable life and particularly that general leavenworth an officer well know and esteem for his gallant service in the late war and for his subsequent good conduct have fall a victim to his zeal and exertion in the discharge of his duty the army be in a high state of discipline its moral condition so far as that be know here be good and the various branch of the public service be carefully attend to it be amply sufficient under its present organization for provide the necessary garrison for the seaboard and for the defense of the internal frontier and also for preserve the element of military knowledge and for keep pace with those improvement which modern experience be continually make and these object appear to i to embrace all the legitimate purpose for which a permanent military force should be maintain in our country the lesson of history teach we its danger and the tendency which exist to an increase this can be well meet and avert by a just caution on the part of the public itself and of those who represent they in congress from the duty which devolve on teh engineer department and upon the topographical engineer a different organization seem to be demand by the public interest and i recommend the subject to your consideration no important change have during this season take place in the condition of the indians arrangement be in progress for the removal of the creeks and will soon be for the removal of the seminoles i regret that the cherokees east of the mississippi have not yet determine as a community to remove how long the personal cause which have heretofore retard that ultimately inevitable measure will continue to operate i be unable to conjecture it be certain however that delay will bring with it accumulate evil which will render their condition more and more unpleasant the experience of every year add to the conviction that emigration and that alone can preserve from destruction the remnant of the tribe yet live amongst we the facility with which the necessary of life be procure and the treaty stipulation provide aid for the emigrant indians in their agricultural pursuit and in the important concern of education and their removal from those cause which have heretofore depress all and destroy many of the tribe can not fail to stimulate their exertion and to reward their industry the two law pass at the last session of congress on the subject of indian affair have be carry into effect and detailed instruction for their administration have be give it will be see by the estimate for the present session that a great reduction will take place in the expenditure of the department in consequence of these law and there be reason to believe that their operation will be salutary and that the colonization of the indians on the western frontier together with a judicious system of administration will still far reduce the expense of this branch of the public service and at the same time promote its usefulness and efficiency circumstance have be recently develop show the existence of extensive fraud under the various law grant pension and gratuity for revolutionary service it be impossible to estimate the amount which may have be thus fraudulently obtain from the national treasury i be satisfied however it have be such as to justify a re examination of the system and the adoption of the necessary check in its administration all will agree that the service and suffering of the remnant of our revolutionary band should be fully compensate but while this be do every proper precaution should be take to prevent the admission of fabricated and fraudulent claim in the present mode of proceed the attestation and certificate of the judicial officer of the various states from a considerable portion of the check which be interpose against the commission of fraud these however have be and may be fabricate and in such a way as to elude detection at the examine office and independently of this practical difficulty it be ascertain that these document be often loosely grant some time even blank certificate have be issue some time prepare paper have be sign without inquiry and in one instance at least the seal of the court have be within reach of a person most interested in its improper application it be obvious that under such circumstance no severity of administration can check the abuse of the law and information have from time to time be communicate to the pension office question or deny the right of person place upon the pension list to the bounty of the country such caution be always attend to and examine but a far more general investigation be call for and i therefore recommend in conformity with the suggestion of the secretary of war that an actual inspection should be make in each state into the circumstance and claim of every person now draw a pension the honest veteran have nothing to fear from such a scrutiny while the fraudulent claimant will be detect and the public treasury relieve to an amount i have reason to believe far great than have heretofore be suspect the detail of such a plan could be so regulated as to interpose the necessary check without any burdensome operation upon the pensioner the object should be two fold to look into the original justice of the claim so far as this can be do under a proper system of regulation by an examination of the claimant themselves and by inquire in the vicinity of their residence into their history and into the opinion entertain of their revolutionary service to ascertain in all case whether the original claimant be live and this by actual personal inspection this measure will if adopt be productive i think of the desire result and i therefore recommend it to your consideration with the further suggestion that all payment should be suspend til the necessary report be receive it will be see by a tabular statement annex to the document transmit to congress that the appropriation for object connect with the war department make at the last session for the service of the year 1834 exclude the permanent appropriation for the payment of military gratuity under the act of 1832 06 07 the appropriation of $ 200,000 for arm and equip the militia and the appropriation of $ 10,000 for the civilization of the indians which be not annually renew amount to the sum of $ 9,003,261 and that the estimate of appropriation necessary for the same branch of service for the year 1835 amount to the sum of $ 5,778,964 make a difference in the appropriation of the current year over the estimate of the appropriation for the next of $ 3,224,297 the principal cause which have operate at this time to produce this great difference be show in the report and document and in the detailed estimate some of these cause be accidental and temporary while other be permanent and aid by a just course of administration may continue to operate beneficially upon the public expenditure a just economy expend where the public service require and withholding where it do not be among the indispensable duty of the government i refer you to the accompany report of the secretary of the navy and to the document with it for a full view of the operation of that important branch of our service during the present year it will be see that the wisdom and liberality with which congress have provide for the gradual increase of our navy material have be second by a corresponding zeal and fidelity on the part of those to whom have be confide the execution of the law on the subject and that but a short period would be now require to put in commission a force large enough for any exigency into which the country may be throw when we reflect upon our position in relation to other nation it must be apparent that in the event of conflict with they we must look chiefly to our navy for the protection of our national right the wide sea which separate we from other government must of necessity be the theater on which an enemy will aim to assail we and unless we be prepared to meet he on this element we can not be say to possess the power requisite to repel or prevent aggression we can not therefore watch with too much attention this arm of our defense or cherish with too much care the mean by which it can possess the necessary efficiency and extension to this end our policy have be heretofore wisely direct to the constant employment of a force sufficient to guard our commerce and to the rapid accumulation of the material which be necessary to repair our vessel and construct with ease such new one as may be require in a state of war in accordance with this policy i recommend to your consideration the erection of the additional dry dock describe by the secretary of the navy and also the construction of the steam battery to which he have refer for the purpose of test their efficacy as auxiliary to the system of defense now in use the report of the postmaster general herewith submit exhibit the condition and prospect of that department from that document it appear that there be a deficit in the fund of the department at the commencement of the present year beyond its available mean of $ 315,599.98 which on the first of july last 1834 07 01 have be reduce to $ 268,092.74 it appear also that the revenue for the come year will exceed the expenditure about $ 270,000 which with the excess of revenue which will result from the operation of the current half year may be expect independently of any increase in the gross amount of postage to supply the entire deficit before the end of 1835 but as this calculation be base on the gross amount of postage which have accrue within the period embrace by the time of strike the balance it be obvious that without a progressive increase in the amount of postage the exist retrenchment must be persevere in through the year 1836 that the department may accumulate a surplus fund sufficient to place it in a condition of perfect ease it will be observe that the revenue of the post office department though they have increase and their amount be above that of any former year have yet fall short of the estimate more than $ 100,000 this be attribute in a great degree to the increase of free letter grow out of the extension and abuse of the franking privilege there have be a gradual increase in the number of executive office to which it have be grant and by an act pass in 1833 03 it be extend to member of congress throughout the whole year it be believe that a revision of the law relative to the franking privilege with some enactment to enforce more rigidly the restriction under which it be grant would operate beneficially to the country by enable the department at an early period to restore the mail facility that have be withdraw and to extend they more widely as the grow settlement of the country may require to a measure so important to the government and so just to our constituent who ask no exclusive privilege for themselves and be not willing to concede they to other i earnestly recommend the serious attention of congress the importance of the post office department and the magnitude to which it have grow both in its revenue and in its operation seem to demand its reorganization by law the whole of its receipt and disbursement have hitherto be leave entirely to executive control and individual discretion the principle be as sound in relation to this as to any other department of the government that as little discretion should be confide to the executive officer who control it as be compatible with its efficiency it be therefore earnestly recommend that it be organize with an auditor and treasurer of its own appoint by the president and senate who shall be branch of the treasury department your attention be again respectfully invite to the defect which exist in the judicial system of the united states nothing can be more desirable than the uniform operation of the federal judiciary throughout the several states all of which stand on the same footing as member of the union have equal right to the advantage and benefit result from its law this object be not attain by the judicial act now in force because they leave one quarter of the states without circuit court it be undoubtedly the duty of congress to place all the states on the same footing in this respect either by the creation of an additional number of associate judge or by an enlargement of the circuit assign to those already appoint so as to include the new states what ever may be the difficulty in a proper organization of the judicial system so as to secure its efficiency and uniformity in all part of the union and at the same time to avoid such an increase of judge as would encumber the supreme appellate tribunal it should not be allow to weigh against the great injustice which the present operation of the system produce i trust that i may be also pardon for renew the recommendation i have so often submit to your attention in regard to the mode of elect the president and vice president of the united states all the reflection i have be able to bestow upon the subject increase my conviction that the good interest of the country will be promote by the adoption of some plan which will secure in all contingency that important right of sovereignty to the direct control of the people could this be attain and the term of those officer be limit to a single period of either four or six year i think our liberty would possess an additional safeguard at your last session i call the attention of congress to the destruction of the public building occupy by the treasury department as the public interest require that another building should be erect with as little delay as possible it be hope that the mean will be seasonably provide and that they will be ample enough to authorize such an enlargement and improvement in the plan of the building as will more effectually accommodate the public officer and secure the public document deposit in it from the casualty of fire i have not be able to satisfy myself that the bill entitle an act to improve the navigation of the wabash river which be send to i at the close of your last session ought to pass and i have therefore withhold from it my approval and now return it to the senate the body in which it originate there can be no question connect with the administration of public affair more important or more difficult to be satisfactorily dealth with than that which relate to the rightful authority and proper action of the federal government upon the subject of internal improvement to inherent embarrassment have be add other result from the course of our legislation concern it i have heretofore communicate freely with congress upon this subject and in advert to it again i can not refrain from express my increase conviction of its extreme importance as well in regard to its bearing upon the maintenance of the constitution and the prudent management of the public revenue as on account of its disturbing effect upon the harmony of the union we be in no danger from violation of the constitution by which encroachment be make upon the personal right of the citizen the sentence of condemnation long since pronounce by the american people upon act of that character will i doubt not continue to prove as salutary in its effect as it be irreversible in its nature but against the danger of unconstitutional act which instead of menace the vengeance of offend authority proffer local advantage and bring in their train the patronage of the government we be i fear not so safe to suppose that because our government have be institute for the benefit of the people it must therefore have the power to do what ever may seem to conduce to the public good be an error into which even honest mind be too apt to fall in yield themselves to this fallacy they overlook the great consideration in which the federal constitution be found they forget that in consequence of the concede diversity in the interest and condition of the different state it be foresee at the period of its adoption that although a particular measure of the government might be beneficial and proper in 1 state it might be the reverse in another that it be for this reason the states would not consent to make a grant to the federal government of the general and usual power of government but of such only as be specifically enumerate and the probable effect of which they could as they think safely anticipate and they forget also the paramount obligation upon all to abide by the compact then so solemnly and as it be hope so firmly establish in addition to the danger to the constitution spring from the source i have state there have be one which be perhaps great than all i allude to the material which this subject have afford for sinister appeal to selfish feeling and the opinion heretofore so extensively entertain of its adaptation to the purpose of personal ambition with such stimulus it be not surprising that the act and pretension of the federal government in this behalf should some time have be carry to an alarming extent the question which have arise upon this subject have relate to the power of make internal improvement within the limit of a state with the right of territorial jurisdiction sufficient at least for their preservation and use to the right of appropriate money in aid of such work when carry on by a state of by a company in virtue of state authority surrender the claim of jurisdiction and to the propriety of appropriation for improvement of a particular class viz for light house beacon buoy public pier and for the removal of sand bar sawyer and other temporary and partial impediment in our navigable river and harbor the claim of power for the general government upon each of these point certainly present matter of the deep interest the first be however of much the great importance in as much as in addition to the danger of unequal and improvident expenditure of public money common to all there be super add to that the conflict jurisdiction of the respective government federal jurisdiction at least to the extent i have state have be justly regard by its advocate as necessarily appurtenant to the power in question if that exist by the constitution that the most injurious conflict would unavoidably arise between the respective jurisdiction of the state and federal governments in the absence of a constitutional provision mark out their respective boundary can not be doubt the local advantage to be obtain would induce the states to overlook in the beginning the danger and difficulty to which they might ultimately be expose the power exercise by the federal government would soon be regard with jealousy by the state authority and originate as they must from implication or assumption it would be impossible to affix to they certain and safe limit opportunity and temptation to the assumption of power incompatible with state sovereignty would be increase and those barrier which resist the tendency of our system toward consolidation greatly weaken the officer and agent of the general government might not always have the discretion to abstain from intermeddle with state concern and if they do they would not always escape the suspicion of having do so collision and consequent irritation would spring up that harmony which should ever exist between the general government and each member of the confederacy would be frequently interrupt a spirit of contention would be engender and the danger of disunion greatly multiply yet we know that not withstand these grave objection this dangerous doctrine be at one time apparently proceed to its final establishment with fearful rapidity the desier to embark the federal government in work of internal improvement prevail in the high degree during the first session of the first congress that i have the honor to meet in my present situation when the bill authorize a subscription on the part of the united states for stock in the maysville and lexington turnpike company pass the two house there have be report by the committees of internal improvements bill contain appropriation for such object inclusive of those for the cumberland road and for harbor and light house to the amount of $ 106,000,000 in this amount be include authority to the secretary of the treasury to subscribe for the stock of different company to a great extent and the residue be principally for the direct construction of road by this government in addition to these project which have be present to the two houses under the sanction and recommendation of their respective committees on internal improvements there be then still pende before the committee and in memorial to congress present but not refer different project for work of a similar character the expense of which can not be estimate with certainty but must have exceed $ 100,000,000 regard the bill authorize a subscription to the stock of the maysville and lexington turnpike company as the enter wedge of a system which however weak at first might soon become strong enough to rive the band of the union asunder and believe that if its passage be acquiesce in by the executive and the people there would no long be any limitation upon the authority of the general government in respect to the appropriation of money for such object i deem it an imperative duty to withhold from it the executive approval although from the obviously local character of that work i might well have content myself with a refusal to approve the bill upon that ground yet sensible of the vital importance of the subject and anxious that my view and opinion in regard to the whole matter should be fully understand by congress and by my constituent i feel it my duty to go far i therefore embrace that early occasion to apprise congress that in my opinion the constitution do not confer upon it the power to authorize the construction of ordinary road and canal within the limit of a state and to say respectfully that no bill admit such a power could receive my official sanction i do so in the confident expectation that the speedy settlement of the public mind upon the whole subject would be greatly facilitate by the difference between the 2 houses and myself and that the harmonious action of the several department of the federal government in regard to it would be ultimately secure so far at least as it regard this branch of the subject my good hope have be realize nearly four year have elapse and several session of congress have intervene and no attempt within my recollection have be make to induce congress to exercise this power the application for the construction of road and canal which be formerly multiply upon your file be no long present and we have good reason to infer that the current public sentiment have become so decide against the pretension as effectually to discourage its reassertion so think i derive the great satisfaction from the conviction that thus much at least have be secure upon this important and embarrassing subject from attempt to appropriate the national fund to object which be confessedly of a local character we can not i trust have anything further to apprehend my view in regard to the expediency of make appropriation for work which be claim to be of a national character and prosecute under state authority assume that congress have the right to do so be state in my annual message to congress in 1830 and also in that contain my objection to the maysville road bill so thoroughly convinced be i that no such appropriation ought to be make by congress until a suitable constitutional provision be make upon the subject and so essential do i regard the point to the high interest of our country that i could not consider myself as discharge my duty to my constituent in give the executive sanction to any bill contain such an appropriation if the people of the united states desire that the public treasury shall be resort to for the mean to prosecute such work they will concur in an amendment of the constitution prescribe a rule by which the national character of the work be to be test and by which the great practicable equality of benefit may be secure to each member of the confederacy the effect of such a regulation would be most salutary in prevent unprofitable expenditure in secure our legislation from the pernicious consequence of a scramble for the favor of government and in repress the spirit of discontent which must inevitably arise from an unequal distribution of treasure which belong alike to all there be another class of appropriation for what may be call without impropriety internal improvement which have always be regard as stand upon different ground from those to which i have refer i allude to such as have for their object the improvement of our harbor the removal of partial and temporary obstruction in our navigable river for the facility and security of our foreign commerce the ground upon which i distinguish appropriation of this character from other have already be state to congress i will now only add that at the 1st session of congress under the new constitution it be provide by law that all expense which should accrue from and after the 15th day of august 1789 in the necessary support and maintenance and repair of all light house beacon buoy and public pier erect place or sink before the passage of the act within any bay inlet harbor or port of the united states for render the navigation thereof easy and safe should be defray out of the treasury of the united states and far that it should be the duty of the secretary of the treasury to provide by contract with the approbation of the president for rebuild when necessary and keep in good repair the light house beacon buoy and public pier in the several states and for furnish they with supply appropriation for similar object have be continue from that time to the present without interruption or dispute as a natural consequence of the increase and extension of our foreign commerce port of entry and delivery have be multiply and establish not only upon our sea board but in the interior of the country upon our lake and navigable river the convenience and safety of this commerce have lead to the gradual extension of these expenditure to the erection of light house the placing planting and sink of buoy beacon and pier and to the removal of partial and temporary obstruction in our navigable river and in the harbor upon our great lakes as well as on the sea board although i have express to congress my apprehension that these expenditure have some time be extravagant and disproportionate to the advantage to be derive from they i have not gelt it to be my duty to refuse my assent to bill contain they and have content myself to follow in this respect in the foot step of all my predecessor sensible however from experience and observation of the great abuse to which the unrestricted exercise of this authority by congress be expose i have prescribe a limitation for the government of my own conduct by which expenditure of this character be confine to place below the port of entry or delivery establish by law i be very sentible that this restriction be not as satisfactory as could be desire and that much embarrassment may be cause to the executive department in its execution by appropriation for remote and not well understand object but as neither my own reflection nor the light which i may properly derive from other source have supply i with a well i shall continue to apply my good exertion to a faithful application of the rule upon which it be found i sincerely regret that i could not give my assent to the bill entitle an act to improve the navigation of the wabash river but i could not have do so without recede from the ground which i have upon the full consideration take upon this subject and of which congress have be heretofore apprise and without throw the subject again open to abuse which no good citizen entertain my opinion could desire i rely upon the intelligence and candor of my fellow citizen in whose liberal indulgence i have already so largely participate for a correct appreciation on my motive in interpose as i have do on this and other occasion check to a course of legislation which without in the slight degree call in question the motive of other i consider as sanction improper and unconstitutional expenditure of public treasure i be not hostile to internal improvement and wish to see they extend to every part of the country but i be fully persuade if they be not commence in a proper manner confine to proper object and conduct under an authority generally concede to be rightful that a successful prosecution of they can not be reasonably expect the attempt will meet with resistance where it might otherwise receive support and instead of strengthen the bond of our confederacy it will only multiply and aggravate the cause of disunion
fellow citizens of the senate and house of representatives in the discharge of my official duty the again devolve upon i of communicate with a new congress the reflection that the representation of the union have be recently renew and that the constitutional term of its service will expire with my own heightens the solicitude with which i shall attempt to lay before it the state of our national concern and the devout hope which i cherish that its labor to improve they may be crown with success you be assemble at a period of profound interest to the american patriot the unexampled growth and prosperity of our country having give we a rank in the scale of nation which remove all apprehension of danger to our integrity and independence from external foe the career of freedom be before we with an earnest from the past that if true to ourselves there can be no formidable obstacle in the future to its peaceful and uninterrupted pursuit yet in proportion to the disappearance of those apprehension which attend our weakness as once contrast with the power of some of the states of the old world should we now be solicitous as to those which belong to the conviction that it be to our own conduct we must look for the preservation of those cause on which depend the excellence and the duration of our happy system of government in the example of other system found on the will of the people we trace to internal dissension the influence which have so often blast the hope of the friend of freedom the social element which be strong and successful when unite against external danger fail in the more difficult task of properly adjust their own internal organization and thus give way the great principle of self government let we trust that this admonition will never be forget by the government or the people of the united states and that the testimony which our experience thus far hold out to the great human family of the practicability and the blessing of free government will be confirm in all time to come we have but to look at the state of our agriculture manufacture and commerce and the unexampled increase of our population to feel the magnitude of the trust commit to we never in any former period of our history have we have great reason than we now have to be thankful to divine providence for the blessing fo health and general prosperity every branch of labor we see crown with the most abundant reward in every element of national resource and wealth and of individual comfort we witness the most rapid and solid improvement with no interruption to this pleasing prospect at home which will not yield to the spirit of harmony and good will that so strikingly pervade the mass of the people in every quarter amidst all the diversity of interest and pursuit to which they be attach and with no cause of solicitude in regard to our external affair which will not it be hope disappear before the principle of simple justice and the forbearance that mark our intercourse with foreign power we have every reason to feel proud of our beloved country the general state of our foreign relation have not materially change since my last annual message in the settlement of the question of the north eastern boundary little progress have be make great britain have decline accede to the proposition of the united states present in accordance with the resolution of the senate unless certain preliminary condition be admit which i deem incompatible with a satisfactory and rightful adjustment of the controversy wait for some distinct proposal from the government of great britain which have be invite i can only repeat the expression of my confidence that with the strong mutual disposition which i believe exist to make a just arrangement this perplexing question can be settle with a due regard to the well found pretension and pac ific policy of all the party to it event be frequently occur on the north eastern frontier of a character to impress upon all the necessity of a speedy and definitive termination of the dispute this consideration add to the desire common to both to relieve the liberal and friendly relation so happily exist between the two country from all embarrassment will no doubt have its just influence upon both our diplomatic intercourse with portugal have be renew and it be expect that the claim of our citizen partially pay will be fully satisfied as soon as the condition of the queen 's government will permit the proper attention to the subject of they that government have i be happy to inform you manifest a determination to act upon the liberal principle which have mark our commercial policy the happy effect upon the future trade between the united states and portugal be anticipate from it and the time be not think to be remote when a system of perfect reciprocity will be establish the installment due under the convention with the king of the two sicily have be pay with that scrupulous fidelity by which his whole conduct have be characterize and the hope be indulge that the adjustment of the vex question of our claim will be follow by a more extended and mutually beneficial intercourse between the two country the internal contest still continue in spain distinguish as this struggle have unhappily be by incident of the most sanguinary character the obligation of the late treaty of indemnification with we have be never the less faithfully execute by the spanish government no provision having be make at the last session of congress for the ascertainment of the claim to be pay and the apportionment of the fund under the convention make with spain i invite your early attention to the subject the public evidence of the debt have accord to the term of the convention and in the form prescribe by it be place in the possession of the united states and the interest as it fall due have be regularly pay upon they our commercial intercourse with cuba stand as regulate by the act of congress no recent information have be receive as to the disposition of the government of madrid and the lamented death of our recently appoint minister on his way to spain with the pressure of their affair at home render it scarcely probable that any change be to be look for during the come year further portion of the florida archive have be send to the united states although the death of one of the commissioner at a critical moment embarrass the progress of the delivery of they the high officer of the local government have recently show an anxious desire in compliance with the order from the parent government to facilitate the selection and delivery of all we have a right to claim negotiation have be open at madrid for the establishment of a last peace between spain and such of the spanish american governments of this hemisphere as have avail themselves of the intimation give to all of they of the disposition of spain to treat upon the basis of their entire independence it be to be regret that simultaneous appointment by all of minister to negotiate with spain have not be make the negotiation itself would have be simplify and this long stand dispute spread over a large portion of the world would have be bring to a more speedy conclusion our political and commercial relation with austria prussia sweden and denmark stand on the usual favorable basis one of the article of our treaty with russia in relation to the trade on the north west coast of america having expire instruction have be give to our minister at st. petersburg to negotiate a renewal of it the long and unbroken amity between the two government give every reason for suppose the article will be renew if strong motive do not exist to prevent it than with our view of the subject can be anticipate here i ask your attention to the message of my predecessor at the opening of the second session fo the 19th congress relative to our commercial intercourse with holland and to the document connect with that subject communicate to the house of representatives on the 10th of january 1825 and 18th of january 1827.coincide in the opinion of my predecessor that holland be not under the regulation of her present system entitle to have her vessel and their cargo receive into the united states on the footing of american vessel and cargo as regard duty of tonnage and impost a respect for his reference of it to the legislature have alone prevent i from act on the subject i should still have wait without comment for the action of congress but recently a claim have be make by belgian subject to admission into our port for their ship and cargoe on the same footing as american with the allegation we could not dispute that our vessel receive in their port the identical treatment shewn to they in the port of holland upon whose vessel no discrimination be make in the port of the united states give the same privilege the belgians expect the same benefit benefit that be in fact enjoy when belgium and holland be unite under one government satisfy with the justice of their pretension to be place on the same footing with holland i could not never the less without disregard to the principle of our law admit their claim to be treat as americans and at the same time a respect for congress to whom the subject have long since be refer have prevent i from produce a just equality by take from the vessel of holland privilege conditionally grant by act of congress although the condition upon which the grant be make have in my judgment fail since 1822 i recommend therefore a review of the act of 1824 and such modification of it as will produce an equality on such term as congress shall think good comport with our settle policy and the obligation of justice to two friendly power with the sublime porte and all the government on the coast of barbary our relation continue to be friendly the proper step have be take to renew our treaty with morocco the argentine republic have again promise to send within the current year a minister to the united states a convention with mexico for extend the time for the appointment of commissioner to run the boundary line have be conclude and will be submit to the senate recent event in that country have awaken the lively solicitude in the united states aware of the strong temptation exist and powerful inducement hold out to the citizen of the united states to mingle in the dissension of our immediate neighbor instruction have be give to the district attorney of the united states where indication warrant it to prosecute without respect to person all who might attempt to violate the obligation of our neutrality while at the same time it have be think necessary to apprise the government of mexico that we should require the integrity of our territory to be scrupulously respect by both party from our diplomatic agent in brazil chile peru central america venezuela and new granada constant assurance be receive of the continue good understanding with the government to which they be severally accredit with those government upon which our citizen have valid and accumulate claim scarcely an advance toward a settlement of they be make owe mainly to their distracted state or to the pressure of imperative domestic question our patience have be and will probably be still far severely try but our fellow citizen whose interest be involve may confide in the determination of the government to obtain for they eventually ample retribution unfortunately many of the nation of this hemisphere be still self torment by domestic dissension revolution succeed revolution injury be commit upon foreigner engage in lawful pursuit much time el apse before a government sufficiently stable be erect to justify expectation of redress minister be send and receive and before the discussion of past injury be fairly begin fresh trouble arise but too frequently new injury be add to the old to be discuss together with the exist government after it have prove its ability to sustain the assault make upon it or with its successor if overthrow if this unhappy condition of thing continue much long other nation will be under the painful necessity of decide whether justice to their suffering citizen do not require a prompt redress of injury by their own power without wait for the establishment of a government competent and endure enough to discuss and to make satisfaction for they since the last session of congress the validity of our claim upon france as liquidate by the treaty of 1831 have be acknowledge by both branch of her legislature and the money have be appropriate for their discharge but the payment be i regret to inform you still withhold a brief recapitulation of the most important incident in this protract controversy will shew how utterly untenable be the ground upon which this course be attempt to be justify on enter upon the duty of my station i find the united states an unsuccessful applicant to the justice of france for the satisfaction of claim the validity of which be never questionable and have now be most solemnly admit by france herself the antiquity of these claim their high justice and the aggravating circumstance out of which they arise be too familiar to the american people to require description it be sufficient to say that for a period of 10 year and upward our commerce be with but little interruption the subject of constant aggression on the part of france aggression the ordinary feature of which be condemnation of vessel and cargoe under arbitrary decree adopt in contravention as well of the law of nation as of treaty stipulation burning on the high sea and seizure and confiscation under special imperial rescript in the port of other nation occupy by the army or under the control of france such it be now concede be the character of the wrong we suffer wrong in many case so flagrant that even their author never deny our right to reparation of the extent of these injury some conception may be form from the fact that after the burning of a large amount at sea and the necessary deterioration in other case by long detention the american property so seize and sacrifice at force sale exclude what be adjudge to privateer before or without condemnation bring into the french treasury upward of 24,000,000 franc besides large custom house duty the subject have already be an affair of 20 year uninterrupted negotiation except for a short time when france be overwhelm by the military power of united europe during this period whilst other nation be extort from her payment of their claim at the point of the bayonet the united states intermit their demand for justice out of respect to the oppressed condition of a gallant people to whom they feel under obligation for fraternal assistance in their own day of suffering and peril the bad effect of these protract and unavaile discussion be obvious and the line of duty be to my mind equally so this be either to insist upon the adjustment of our claim within a reasonable period or to abandon they altogether i could not doubt that by this course the interest and honor of both country would be well consult instruction be therefore give in this spirit to the minister who be send out once more to demand reparation upon the meeting of congress in december 1829 i feel it my duty to speak of these claim and the delay of france in term calculate to call the serious attention of both country to the subject the then french ministry take exception to the message on the ground of its conataine a menace under it be not agreeable to the french government to negotiate the american minister of his own accord refute the construction which be attempt to be put upon the message and at the same time call to the recollection of the french ministry that the president 's message be a communication address not to foreign government but to the congress of the united states in which it be enjoin upon he by the constitution to lay before that body information of the state of the union comprehend its foreign as well as its domestic relation and that if in the discharge of this duty he feel it indumbent upon he to summon the attention of congress in due time to what might be the possible consequence of exist difficulty with any foreign government he might fairly be suppose to do so under a sense of his own government and not from any intention of hold a menace over a foreign power the view take by he receive my approbation the french government be satisfied and the negotiation be continue it terminate in the treaty of july 4 recognize the justice of our claim in part and promise payment to the amount of 25,000,000 franc in 6 annual installment the ratification of this treaty be exchange at washington on the second of february 1832 and in 5 day thereafter it be lay before congress who immediately pass the act necessary on our part to secure to france the commercial advantage concede to she in the compact the treaty have previously be solemnly ratify by the king of the french in term which be certainly not mere matter of form and of which the translation be as follow we approve the above convention in all and each of the disposition which be contain in it do declare by ourselves as well as by our heir and successor that it be accept approve ratify and confirm and by these present sign by our hand we do accept approve ratify and confirm it promise on the faith and word of a king to observe it and to cause it to be observe inviolably without ever contravene it or suffer it to be contravene directly or indirectly for any cause or under any pretense whatsoever official information of the exchange of ratification in the united states reach paris whilst the chambers be in session the extraordinary and to we injurious delay of the french government in their action upon the subject of its fulfillment have be heretofore state to congress and i have no disposition to enlarge upon they here it be sufficient to observe that the then pende session be allow to expire without even an effort to obtain the necessary appropriation that the two succeed one be also suffer to pass away without anything like a serious attempt to obtain a decision upon the subject and that it be not until the fourth session almost three year after the conclusion of the treaty and more than two year after the exchange of ratification that the bill for the execution of the treaty be press to a vote and reject in the mean time the government of the united states have full confidence that a treaty enter into and so solemnly ratify by the french king would be execute in good faith and not doubt that provision would be make for the payment of the first installment which be to become due on the second day of february 1833 negotiate a draft for the amount through the bank of the united states when this draft be present by the holder with the credential require by the treaty to authorize he to receive the money the government of france allow it to be protest in addition to the injury in the nonpayment of the money by france conformably to her engagement the united states be expose to a heavy claim on the part of the bank under pretense of damage in satisfaction of which that institution seize upon and still retain an equal amount of the public money congress be in session when the decision of the chambers reach washington and an immediate communication of this apparently final decision of france not to fulfill the stipulation of the treaty be the course naturally to be expect from the president the deep tone of dissatisfaction which pervade the public mind and the correspondent excitement produce in congress by only a general knowledge of the result render it more than probable that a resort to immediate measure of redress would be the consequence of call the attention of that body to the subject sincerely desirous of preserve the pacific relation which have so long exist between the two country i be anxious to avoid this course if i could be satisfied that by so neither the interest nor the honor of my country would be compromitte without the full assurance on that point i could not hope to acquit myself of the responsibility to be incur in suffer congress to adjourn without lay the subject before they those receive by i be believe to be of that character that the feeling produce in the united states by the news of the rejection of the appropriation would be such as i have describe they to have be be foresee by the french government and prompt measure be take by it to prevent the consequence the king in person express through our minister at paris his profound regret at the decision of the chambers and promise to send forthwith a ship with dispatch to his miniter here authorize he to give such assurance as would satisfy the government and people of the united states that the treaty would yet be faithfully execute by france the national ship arrive and the minister receive his instruction claim to act under the authority derive from they he give to this government in the name of his the most solemn assurance that as soon after the new election as the charter would permit the french chambers would be convene and the attempt to procure the necessary appropriation renew that all the constitutional power of the king and his minister should be put in requisition to accomplish the object and he be understand and so expressly inform by this government at the time to engage that the question should be press to a decision at a period sufficiently early to permit information of the result to be communicate to congress at the commencement of their next session rely upon these assurance i incur the responsibility great as i regard it to be of suffer congress to separate without communicate with they upon the subject the expectation justly found upon the promise thus solemnly make to this government by that of france be not realize the french chambers meet on the thirty first of july 1834 soon after the election and although our minister in paris urge the french ministry to bring the subject before they they decline do so he next insist that the chambers of prorogue without act on the subject should be reassemble at a period so early that their action on the treaty might be know in washington prior to the meeting of congress this reasonable request be not only decline but the chambers be prorogue to the 29th of december a day so late that their decision however urgently press could not in all probability be obtain in time to reach washington before the necessary adjournment of congress by the constitution the reason give by the ministry for refuse to convoke the chambers at an early period be afterwards shewn not to be insuperable by their actual convocation on the first of december under a special call for domestic purpose which fact however do not become known to this government until after the commencement of the last session of congress thus disappoint in our just expectation it become my imperative duty to consult with congress in regard to the expediency of a resort to retaliatory measure in case the stipulation of the treaty should not be speedily comply with and to recommend such as in my judgment the occasion c alle for to this end an unreserved communication of the case in all its aspect become indispensable to have shrink in make it from say all that be necessary to its correct understanding and that the truth would justify for fear of give offense to other would have be unworthy of we to have go on the other hand a single step far for the purpose of wound the pride of a government and people with whom we have so many motive for cultivate relation of amity and reciprocal advantage would have be unwise and improper admonish by the past of the difficulty of make even the simple statement of our wrong without disturb the sensibility of those who have by their position become responsible for their redress and earnestly desirous of prevent further obstacle from that source i go out of my way to preclude a construction of the message by which the recommendation that be make to congress might be regard as a menace to france in not only disavow such a design but in declare that her pride and her power be too well known to expect anything from her fear the message do not reach paris until more than a month after the chambers have be in session and such be the insensibility of the ministry to our rightful claim and just expectation that our minister have be inform that the matter when introduce would not be press as a cabinet measure although the message be not officially communicate to the french government and not withstand the declaration to the contrary which it contain the french minstry decide to consider the conditional recommendation of reprisal a menace and an insult which the honor of the nation make it incumbent on they to resent the measure resort to by they to evince their sense of the suppose indignity be the immediate recall of their minister at washington the offer of passport to the american minister at paris and a public notice to the legislative chambers that all diplomatic intercourse with the united states have be suspend have in this manner vindicate the dignity of france they next proceed to illustrate her justice to this end a bill be immediately introduce into the chamber of deputies propose to make the appropriation necessary to carry into effect the treaty as this bill subsequently pass into a law the provision of which now constitute the main subject of difficulty between the two nation it become my duty in order to place the subject before you in a clear light to trace the history of its passage and to refer with some particularity to the proceeding and discussion in regard to it the minister of finance in his opening speech allude to the measure which have be adopt to resent the suppose indignity and recommend the execution of the treaty as a measure require by the honor and justice of france he as the organ of the ministry declare the message so long as it have not receive the sanction of congress a mere expression of the personal opinion of the president for which neither the government nor people of the united states be responsible and that an engagement have be enter into for the fulfillment of which the honor of france be pledge entertain these view the single condition which the french ministry propose to annex to the payment of the money be that it should not be make until it be ascertain that the government of the united states have do nothing to injure the interest of france or in other word that no step have be authorize by congress of a hostile character toward france what the disposition of action of congress might be be then unknown to the french cabinet but on the 14th day of january the senate resolve that it be at that time inexpedient to adopt any legislative measure in regard to the state of affair between the united states and france and no action on the subject have occur in the house of representatives these fact be know in paris prior to the 28th of march 1835 when the committee to whom the bill of indemnification have be refer report it to the chamber of deputies that committee substantially re echo the sentiment of the ministry declare that congress have set aside the proposition of the president and recommend the passage of the bill without any other restriction than that originally propose thus be it know to the french ministry and chambers that if the position assume by they and which have be so frequently and solemnly announce as the only one compatible with the honor of france be maintain and the bill pass as originally propose the money would be pay and there would be an end of this unfortunate controversy but this cheer prospect be soon destroy by an amendment introduce into the bill at the moment of its passage provide that the money should not be pay until the french government have receive satisfactory explanation of the president 's message of the second december 1834 and what be still more extraordinary the president of the council of minister adopt this amendment and consent to its incorporation in the bill in regard to a suppose insult which have be formally resent by the recall of their minister and the offer of passport to ours they now for the first time propose to ask explanation sentiment and proposition which they have declare could not justly be impute to the government or people of the united states be set up as obstacle to the performance of an act of concede justice to that government and people they have declare that the honor of france require the fulfillment of the engagement into which the king have enter unless congress adopt the recommendation of the message they ascertain that congress do not adopt they and yet that fulfillment be refuse unless they first obtain from the president explanation of an opinion characterize by themselves as personal and inoperative the conception that it be my intention to menace or insult the government of france be as unfounded as the attempt to extort from the fear of that nation what her sense of justice may deny would be vain and ridiculous but the constitution of the united states impose on the president the duty of lay before congress the condition of the country in its foreign and domestic relation and of recommend such measure as may in his opinion be require by its interest from the performance of this duty he can not be deter by the fear of wound the sensibility of the people or government of whom it may become necessary to speak and the american people be incapble of submit to an interference by any government on earth however powerful with the free performance of the domestic duty which the constitution have impose on their public functionary the discussion which intervene between the several department of our government be to ourselves and for anything say in they our public servant be only responsible to their own constituent and to each other if in the course of their consultation fact be erroneously state or unjust deduction be make they require no other inducement to correct they however informed of their error than their love of justice and what be due to their own character but they can never submit to be interrogate upon the subject as a matter of right by a foreign power when our discussion terminate in act our responsibility to foreign power commence not as individual but as a nation the principle which call in question the president for the language of his message would equally justify a foreign power in demand explanation of the language use in the report of a committee or by a member in debate this be not the first time that the government of france have take exception to the message of american presidents president washington and the first president adams in the performance of their duty to the american people fall under the animadversion of the french directory the obj ection take by the ministry of charles 10 and remove by the explanation make by our minister upon the spot have already be advert to when it be understand that the ministry of the present king take exception to my message of last year put a construction upon it which be disavow on its face our late minister at paris in answer to the note which first announce a dissatisfaction with the language use in the message make a communication to the french government under date of the 29th of january 1835 calculate to remove all impression which an unreasonable susceptibility have create he repeat and call the attention of the french government to the disavowal contain in the message itself of any intention to intimidate by menace he truly declare that it contain and be intend to contain no charge of ill faith against the king of the french and properly distinguish between the right to complain in unexceptionable term of the omission to execute an agreement and an accusation of bad motive in withhold such execution and demonstrate that the necessary use of that right ought not to be consider as an offensive imputation although this communication be make without instruction and entirely on the minister 's own responsibility yet it be afterwards make the act of this government by my full approbation and that approbation be officially make known on the 25th of april 1835 to the french government it however fail to have any effect the law after this friendly explanation pass with the obnoxious amendment support by the king 's minister and be finally approve by the king the people of the united states be justly attach to a pacific system in their intercourse with foreign nation it be proper therefore that they should know whether their government have adhere to it in the present instance it have be carry to the utmost extent that be consistent with a become self respect the note of the 29th of january to which i have before allude be not the only one which our minister take upon himself the responsibility of present on the same subject and in the same spirit find that it be intend to make the payment of a just debt dependent on the performance of a condition which he know could never be comply with he think it a duty to make another attempt to convince the french government that whilst self respect and regard to the dignity of other nation would always prevent we from use any language that ought to give offense yet we could never admit a right in any foreign government to ask explanation of or to interfere in any manner in the communication which one branch of our public council make with another that in the present case no such language have be use and that this have in a former note be fully and voluntarily state before it be contemplate to make the explantion a condition and that there might be no misapprehension he state the term use in that note and he officially inform they that it have be approve by the president and that therefore every explanation which could reasonably be ask or honorably give have be already make that the contemplated measure have be anticipate by a voluntary and friendly declaration and be therefore not only useless but might be deem offensive and certainly would not be comply with if annex as a condition when this latter communication to which i especially invite the attention of congress be lay before i i entertain the hope that the mean it be obviously intend to afford of an honorable and speedy adjustment of the difficulty between the two nation would have be accept and i therefore do not hesitate to give it my sanction and full approbation this be due to the minister who have make himself responsible for the act and it be publish to the people of the united states and be now lay before their representative to shew hos far their executive have go in its endeavor to restore a good understanding betwe en the two country it would have be at any time communicate to the government of france have it be officially request the french government having receive all the explanation which honor and principle permit and which could in reason be ask it be hope it would no long hesitate to pay the installment now due the agent authorize to receive the money be instruct to inform the french minister of his readiness to do so in reply to this notice he be tell that the money could not then be pay because the formality require by the act of the chambers have not be arrange not having receive any official information of the intention of the french government and anxious to bring as far as practicable this unpleasant affair to a close before the meeting of congress that you might have the whole subject before you i cause our charge d'affaire at paris to be instruct to ask for the final determination of the french government and in the event of their refusal to pay the installment now due without further explanation to return to the united states the result of this last application have not yet reach we but be daily expect that it may be favorable be my sincere wish france have now through all the branch of her government acknowledge the validity of our claim and the obligation of the treaty of 1831 and there really exist no adequate cause for further delay will at length it may be hope adopt the course which the interest of both nation not less than the principle of justice so imperiously require the treaty be once execute on her part little will remain to disturb the friendly relation of the two country nothing indeed which will not yield to the suggestion of a pacific and enlightened policy and to the influence of that mutual good will and of those generous recollection which we may confidently expect will then be revive in all their ancient force in any event however the principle involve in the new aspect which have be give to the controversy be so vitally important to the independent administration of the government that it can neither be surrender nor compromitte without national degradation i hope it be unnecessary for i to say that such a sacrifice will not be make through any agency of mine the honor of my country shall never be stain by an apology from i for the statement of truth and the performance of duty nor can i give any explanation of my official act except such as be due to integrity and justice and consistent with the principle on which our institution have be frame this determination will i be confident be approve by my constituent i have indeed study their character to but little purpose if the sum of 25,000,000 franc will have the weight of a feather in the estimation of what appertain to their national independence and if unhappily a different impression should at any time obtain in any quarter they will i be sure rally round the government of their choice with alacrity and unanimity and silence for ever the degrading imputation having thus frankly present to you the circumstance which since the last session of congress have occur in this interesting and important matter with the view of the executive in regard to they it be at this time only necessary to add that when ever the advice now daily expect from our chargyy d'affaire shall have be receive they will be make the subject of a special communication the condition of the public finance be never more flattering than at the present period since my last annual communication all the remain of the public debt have be redeem or money have be place in deposit for this purpose when ever the creditor choose to receive it all the other pecuniary engagement of the government have be honorably and promptly fulfil and there will be a balance in the treasury at the close of the year of about $ 19,000,000 it be believe that after meet all outstanding and unexpended appropriation there will remain near $ 11,000,000 to be apply to any new object which congress may designate or to the more rapid execution of the work already in progress in aid of these object and to satisfy the current expenditure of the ensue year it be estimate that there will be receive from various source $ 20,000,000 more in 1836 should congress make new appropriation in conformity with the estimate which will be submit from the proper department amount to about $ 24,000,000 still the available surplus at the close of the next year after deduct all unexpended appropriation will probably not be less than $ 6,000,000 this sum can in my judgment be now usefully apply to propose improvement in our navy yard and to new national work which be not enumerate in the present estimate or to the more rapid completion of those already begin either would be constitutional and useful and would render unnecessary any attempt in our present peculiar condition to divide the surplus revenue or to reduce it any fast than will be effect by the exist law in any event as the annual report from the secretary of the treasury will enter into detail shew the probability of some decrease in the revenue during the next 7 year and a very considerable deduction in 1842 it be not recommend that congress should undertake to modify the present tariff so as to disturb the principle on which the compromise act be pass taxation on some of the article of general consumption which be not in competition with our own production may be no doubt so diminish as to lessen to some extent the source of this revenue and the same object can also be assist by more liberal provision for the subject of public defense which in the present state of our prosperity and wealth may be expect to engage your attention if however after satisfy all the demand which can arise from these source the unexpended balance in the treasury should still continue to increase it would be well to bear with the evil until the great change contemplate in our tariff law have occur and shall enable we to revise the system with that care and circumspection which be due to so delicate and important a subject it be certainly our duty to diminish as far as we can the burden of taxation and to regard all the restriction which be impose on the trade and navigation of our citizen as evil which we shall mitigate when ever we be not prevent by the adverse legislation and policy of foreign nation or those primary duty which the defense and independence of our country enjoin upon we that we have accomplish much toward the relief of our citizen by the change which have accompany the payment of the public debt and the adoption of the present revenue law be manifest from the fact that compare to 1833 there be a diminution of near $ 25,000,000 in the last two year and that our expenditure independently of those for the public debt have be reduce near $ 9,000,000 during the same period let we trust that by the continued observance of economy and by harmonize the great interest of agriculture manufacture and commerce much more may be accomplish to diminish the burden of government and to increase still further the enterprise and the patriotic affection of all class of our citizen and all the member of our happy confederacy as the datum which the secretary of the treasury will lay before you in regard to our financial resource be full and extended and will afford a safe guide in your future calculation i think it unnecessary to offer any further observation on that subject here among the evidence of the increase prosperity of the country not the least gratifying be that afford by the receipt from the sale of the public land which amount in the present year to the unexpected sum of $ 11,000,000 this circumstance attest the rapidity with which agriculture the first and most important occupation of man advance and contribute to the wealth and power of our extended territory be still of the opinion that it be our good policy as far as we can consistently with the obligation under which those land be cede to the united states to promote their speedy settlement i beg leave to call the attention of the present congress to the suggestion i have offer respect it in my former message the extraordinary receipt from the sale of the public land invite you to consider what improvement the land system and particularly the condition of the general land office may require at the time this institution be organize near a quarter century ago it would probably have be think extravagant to anticipate for this period such an addition to its business as have be produce by the vast increase of those sale during the past and present year it may also be observe that since the year 1812 the land office and survey district have be greatly multiply and that numerous legislative enactment from year to year since that time have impose a great amount of new and additional duty upon that office while the want of a timely application of force commensurate with the care and labor require have cause the increase embarrassment of accumulate arrear in the different branch of the establishment these impediment to the expedition of much duty in the general land office induce i to submit to your judgment whether some modification of the law relate to its organization or an organization of a new character be not call for at the present juncture to enable the office to accomplish all the end of its institution with a great degree of facility and promptitude than experience have prove to be practicable under exist regulation the variety of the concern and the magnitude and complexity of the detail occupy and divide the attention of the commissioner appear to render it difficult if not impracticable for that officer by any possible assiduity to bestow on all the multifarious subject upon which he be call to act the ready and careful attention due to their respective importance unless the legislature shall assist he by a law providing or enable he to provide for a more regular and economical distribution of labor with the incident responsibility among those employ under his direction the mere manual operation of affix his signature to the vast number of document issue from his office subtract so largely from the time and attention claim by the weighty and complicated subject daily accumulate in that branch of the public service as to indicate the strong necessity of revise the organic law of the establishment it will be easy for congress hereafter to proportion the expenditure on account of this branch of the service to its real want by abolish from time to time the office which can be dispense with the extinction of the public debt having take place there be no long any use for the office of commissioners of loans and of the sinking fund i recommend therefore that they be abolish and that proper measure be take for the transfer to the treasury department of any fund book and paper connect with the operation of those office and that the proper power be give to that department for close finally any portion of their business which may remain to be settle it be also incumbent on congress in guard the pecuniary interest of the country to discontinue by such a law as be pass in 1812 the receipt of the bill of the bank of the united states in payment of the public revenue and to provide for the designation of an agent whose duty it shall be to take charge of the book and stock of the united states in that institution and to close all connection with it after the 3d of march 1836 1836 03 03 when its charter expire in make provision in regard to the disposition of this stock it will be essential to define clearly and strictly the duty and power of the officer charge with that branch of the public service it will be see from the correspondence which the secretary of the treasury will lay before you that not withstand the large amount of the stock which the united states hold in that institution no information have yet be communicate which will enable the government to anticipate when it can receive any dividend or derive any benefit from it connect with the condition of the finance and the flourish state of the country in all its branch of industry it be pleasing to witness the advantage which have be already derive from the recent law regulate the value of the gold coinage these advantage will be more apparent in the course of the next year when the branch mint authorize to be establish in north carolina georgia and louisiana shall have go into operation aid as it be hope they will be by further reform in the banking system of the states and by judicious regulation on the part of congress in relation to the custody of the public money it may be confidently anticipate that the use of gold and silver as circulate medium will become general in the ordinary transaction connect with the labor of the country the great desideratum in modern time be an efficient check upon the power of bank prevent that excessive issue of paper whence arise those fluctuation in the standard of value which render uncertain the reward of labor it be suppose by those who establish the bank of the united states that from the credit give to it by the custody of the public money and other privilege and the precaution take to guard against the evil which the country have suffer in the bankruptcy of many of the state institution of that period we should derive from that institution all the security and benefit of a sound currency and every good end that be attainable under the provision of the constitution which authorize congress alone to coin money and regulate the value thereof but it be scarcely necessary now to say that these anticipation have not be realize after the extensive embarrassment and distress recently produce by the bank of the united states from which the country be now recover aggravate as they be by pretension to power which defy the public authority and which if acquiesce in by the people would have change the whole character of our government every candid and intelligent individual must admit that for the attainment of the great advantage of a sound currency we must look to a course of legislation radically different from that which create such an institution in consider the mean of obtain so important an end we must set aside all calculation of temporary convenience and be influence by those only which be in harmony with the true character and the permanent interest of the republic we must recur to first principle and see what it be that have prevent the legislation of congress and the states on the subject of currency from satisfy the public expectation and realize result correspond to those which have attend the action of our system when truly consistent with the great principle of equality upon which it rest and with that spirit of forbearance and mutual concession and generous patriotism which be originally and must ever continue to be the vital element of our union on this subject i be sure that i can not be mistake in ascribe our want of success to the undue countenance which have be afford to the spirit of monopoly all the serious danger which our system have yet encounter may be trace to the resort to imply power and the use of corporation clothe with privilege the effect of which be to advance the interest of the few at the expense of the many we have feel but one class of these danger exhibit in the contest wage by the bank of the united states against the government for the last four year happily they have be obviate for the present by the indignant resistance of the people but we should recollect that the principle whence they spring be an ever active one which will not fail to renew its effo rt in the same and in other form so long as there be a hope of success found either on the inattention of the people or the treachery of their representative to the subtle progress of its influence the bank be in fact but one of the fruit of a system at war with the genius of all our institution a system found upon a political creed the fundamental principle of which be a distrust of the popular will as a safe regulator of political power and whose great ultimate object and inevitable result should it prevail be the consolidation of all power in our system in one central government lavish public disbursement and corporation with exclusive privilege would be its substitute for the original and as yet sound check and balance of the constitution the mean by whose silent and secret operation a control would be exercise by the few over the political conduct of the many by first acquire that control over the labor and earning of the great body of the people wherever this spirit have effect an alliance with political power tyranny and despotism have be the fruit if it be ever use for the end of government it have to be incessantly watch or it corrupt the source of the public virtue and agitate the country with question unfavorable to the harmonious and steady pursuit of its true interest we be now to see whether in the present favorable condition of the country we can not take an effectual stand against thei spirit of monopoly and practically prove in respect to the currency as well as other important interest that ther be no necessity for so extensive a resort to it as that which have be heretofore practice the experience of another year have confirm the utter fallacy of the idea that the bank of the united states be necessary as a fiscal agent of the government without its aid as such indeed in despite of all the embarrassment it be in its power to create the revenue have be pay with punctuality by our citizen the business of exchange both foreign and domestic have be conduct with convenience and the circulate medium have be greatly improve by the use of the state bank which do not derive their charter from the general government and be not control by its authority it be ascertain that the money of the united states can be collect and disburse without loss or inconvenience and that all the want of the community in relation to exchange and currency be supply as well as they have ever be before if under circumstance the most unfavorable to the steadiness of the money market it have be find that the consideration on which the bank of the united states rest its claim to the public favor be imaginary and groundless it can not be doubt that the experience of the future will be more decisive against they it have be see that without the agency of a great moneyed monopoly the revenue can be collect and conveniently and safely apply to all the purpose of the public expenditure it be also ascertain that instead of be necessarily make to promote the evil of an unchecked paper system the management of the revenue can be make auxiliary to the reform which the legislature of several of the states have already commence in regard to the suppression of small bill and which have only to be foster by proper regulation on the part of congress to secure a practical return to the extent require for the security of the currency to the constitutional medium sever from the government as political engine and not susceptible of dangerous extension and combination the state bank will not be tempt nor will they have teh power which we have see exercise to divert the public fund from the legitimate purpose of the government the collection and custody of the revenue be on the contrary a source of credit to they will increase the security which the states provide for a faithful execution of their trust by multiply the scrutiny to which their operation and account will be subject thus dispose as well from interest as the obligation of their charter it can not be doubt that such condition as congress may see fit to adopt respect the deposit in these institution with a view to the gradual disuse of the small bill will be cheerfully comply with and that we shall soon gain in place of the bank of the united states a practical reform in the whole paper system of the country if by this policy we can ultimately witness the suppression of all bank bill below $ 20 it be apparent that gold and silver will take their place and become the principal circulate medium in the common business of the farmer and mechanic of the country the attainment of such a result will form an era in the history of our country which will be dwell upon with delight by every true friend of its liberty and independence it will lighten the great tax which our paper system have so long collect from the earning of labor and do more to revive and perpetuate those habit of economy and simplicity which be so congenial to the character of republicans than all the legislation which have yet be attempt to this subject i feel that i can not too earnestly invite the special attention of congress without the exercise of whose authority the opportunity to accomplish so much public good must pass unimproved deeply impressed with its vital importance the executive have take all the step within his constitutional power to guard the public revenue and defeat the expectation which the bank of the united states indulge of renew and perpetuate its monopoly on the ground of its necessity as a fiscal agent and as afford a sounder currency than could be obtain without such an institution in the performance of this duty much responsibility be incur which would have be gladly avoid if the stake which the public have in the question could have be otherwise preserve although clothe with the legal authority and support by precedent i be aware that there be in the act of the removal of the deposit a liability to excite that sensitiveness to executive power which it be characteristic and the duty of free man to indulge but i rely on this feeling also direct by patriotism and intelligence to vindicate the conduct which in the end would appear to have be call for by the interest of my country the apprehension natural to this feeling that there may have be a desire through the instrumentality of that measure to extend the executive influence or that it may have be prompt by motive not sufficiently free from ambition be not over look under the operation of our institution the public servant who be call on to take a step of high responsibility should feel in the freedom which give rise to such apprehension his high security when unfounded the attention which they arouse and the discussion they excite deprive those who indulge they of the power to do harm when just they but hasten the certainty with which the great body of our citizen never fail to repel an attempt to procure the sanction to any exercise of power inconsistent with the jealous maintenance of their right under such conviction and entertain no doubt that my constitutional obligation demand the step which be take inreference to the removal of the deposit it be impossible for i to be deter from the path of duty by a fear that my motive could be misjudge or that political prejudice could defeat the just consideration of the merit of my conduct the result have shew how safe be this reliance upon the patriotic temper and enlighten discernment of the people that measure have now be before they and have stand the test of all the severe analysis which its general importance the interest it affect and the apprehension it excite be calculate to produce and it now remain for congress to consider what legislation have become necessary in consequence i need only add to what i have on former occasion say on this subject general ly that in the regulation which congress may prescribe respect the custody of the public money it be desirable that as little discretion as may be deem consistent with their safe keeping should be give to the executive agent no one can be more deeply impressed than i be with the soundness of the doctrine which restrain and limit by specific provision executive discretion as far as it can be do consistently with the preservation of its constitutional character in respect to the control over the public money this doctrine be peculiarly applicable and be in harmony with the great principle which i feel i be sustain in the controversy with the bank of the united states which have result in sever to some extent a dangerous connection between a moneyed and political power the duty of the legislature to define by clear and positive enactment the nature and extent of the action which it belong to the executive to superintend spring out of a policy analogous to that which enjoin upon all branch of the federal government an abstinence from the exercise of power not clearly grant in such a government possess only limited and specific power the spirit of its general administration can not be wise or just when it oppose the reference of all doubtful point to the great source of authority the states and the people whose number and diversified relation secure they against the influence and excitement which may mis lead their agent make they the safe depository of power in its application to the executive with reference to the legislative branch of the government the same rule of action should make the president ever anxious to avoid the exercise of any discretionary authority which can be regulate by congress the bias which may operate upon he will not be so likely to extend to the representative of the people in that body in my former message to congress i have repeatedly urge the propriety of lessen the discretionary authority lodge in the various departments but it have produce no effect as yet except the discontinuance of extra allowance in the army and navy and the substitution of fix salary in the latter it be believe that the same principle could be advantageously apply in all case and would promote the efficiency and economy of the public service at the same tiem that great satisfaction and more equal justice would be secure to the public officer generally the accompanying report of the secretary of war will put you in possession of the operation of the department confide to his care in all its diversified relation during the past year i be gratify in be able to inform you that no occurrence have require any movement of the military force except such as be common to a state of peace the service of the army have be limit to their usual duty at the various garrison upon the atlantic and in land frontier with the exception state by the secretary of war our small military establishment appear to be adequate to the purpose for which it be maintain and it form a nucleus around which any additional force may be collect should the public exigency unfortunately require any increase of our military mean
fellow citizen of the senate and house of representatives address to you the last annual message i shall ever present to the congress of the united states it be a source of the most heartfelt satisfaction to be able to congratulate you on the high state of prosperity which our beloved country have attain with no cause at home or abroad to lessen the confidence with which we look to the future for continue proof of the capacity of our free institution to produce all the fruit of good government    the general condition of our affair may well excite our national pride i can not avoid congratulate you and my country particularly on the success of the effort make during my administration by the executive and legislature in conformity with the sincere constant and earnest desire of the people to maintain peace and establish cordial relation with all foreign power our gratitude be due to the supreme ruler of the universe and i invite you to unite with i in offer to he fervent supplication that his providential care may ever be extend to those who follow we enable they to avoid the danger and the horror of war consistently with a just and indispensable regard to the right and honor of our country but although the present state of our foreign affair stand without important change as they do when you separate in july last be flattering in the extreme i regret to say that many question of an interesting character at issue with other power be yet unadjusted amongst the most prominent of these be that of our northeast boundary with an undiminished confidence in the sincere desire of his britannic majesty 's government to adjust that question i be not yet in possession of the precise ground upon which it propose a satisfactory adjustment with france our diplomatic relation have be resume and under circumstance which attest the disposition of both government to preserve a mutually beneficial intercourse and foster those amicable feeling which be so strongly require by the true interest of the two country with russia austria prussia naples sweden and denmark the good understanding exist and our commercial intercourse be gradually expand itself with they it be encourage in all these country except naples by their mutually advantageous and liberal treaty stipulation with we the claim of our citizen on portugal be admit to be just but provision for the payment of they have be unfortunately delay by frequent political change in that kingdom the blessing of peace have not be secure by spain our connection with that country be on the good footing with the exception of the burden still impose upon our commerce with her possession out of europe the claim of american citizen for loss sustain at the bombardment of antwerp have be present to the government of holland and belgium and will be press in due season to settlement with brazil and all our neighbor of this continent we continue to maintain relation of amity and concord extend our commerce with they as far as the resource of the people and the policy of their government will permit the just and long stand claim of our citizen upon some of they be yet source of dissatisfaction and complaint no danger be apprehend however that they will not be peacefully although tardily acknowledge and pay by all unless the irritate effect of her struggle with texas should unfortunately make our immediate neighbor mexico an exception it be already know to you by the correspondence between the two government communicate at your last session that our conduct in relation to that struggle be regulate by the same principle that govern we in the dispute between spain and mexico herself and i trust that it will be find on the most severe scrutiny that our act have strictly correspond with our profession that the inhabitant of the united states should feel strong prepossession for the one party be not surprising but this circumstance should of itself teach we great caution lest it lead we into the great error of suffer public policy to be regulate by partially or prejudice and there be consideration connect with the possible result of this contest between the two party of so much delicacy and importance to the united states that our character require that we should neither anticipate event nor attempt to control they the know desire of the texans to become a part of our system although its gratification depend upon the reconcilement of various and conflicting interest necessarily a work of time and uncertain in itself be calculate to expose our conduct to misconstruction in the eye of the world there be already those who indifferent to principle themselves and prone to suspect the want of it in other charge we with ambitious design and insidious policy you will perceive by the accompany document that the extraordinary mission from mexico have be terminate on the sole ground that the obligation of this government to itself and to mexico under treaty stipulation have compel i to trust a discretionary authority to a high officer of our army to advance into territory claim as part of texas if necessary to protect our own or the neighboring frontier from indian depredation in the opinion of the mexican functionary who have just leave we the honor of his country will be wound by american soldier enter with the most amicable avowed purpose upon ground from which the follower of his government have be expel and over which there be at present no certainty of a serious effort on its part to re establish its dominion the departure of this minister be the more singular as he be apprise that the sufficiency of the cause assign for the advance of our troop by the command general have be seriously doubt by i and there be every reason to suppose that the troop of the united states their commander having have time to ascertain the truth or falsehood of the information upon which they have be march to nacogdoches would be either there in perfect accordance with the principle admit to be just in his conference with the secretary of state by the mexican minister himself or be already withdraw in consequence of the impressive warning their command officer have receive from the department of war it be hope and believe that his government will take a more dispassionate and just view of this subject and not be dispose to construe a measure of justifiable precaution make necessary by its known inability in execution of the stipulation of our treaty to act upon the frontier into an encroachment upon its right or a stain upon its honor in the mean time the ancient complaint of injustice make on behalf of our citizen be disregarded and new cause of dissatisfaction have arise some of they of a character require prompt remonstrance and ample and immediate redress i trust however by temper firmness with courtesy and act with great forbearance upon every incident that have occur or that may happen to do and to obtain justice and thus avoid the necessity of again bring this subject to the view of congress it be my duty to remind you that no provision have be make to execute our treaty with mexico for trace the boundary line between the two country what ever may be the prospect of mexico 's be soon able to execute the treaty on its part it be proper that we should be in anticipation prepare at all time to perform our obligation without regard to the probable condition of those with whom we have contract they the result of the confidential inquiry make into the condition and prospect of the newly declare texan government will be communicate to you in the course of the session commercial treaty promise great advantage to our enterprise merchant and navigator have be form with the distant government of muscat and siam the ratification have be exchange but have not reach the department of state cope of the treaty will be transmit to you if receive before or publish if arrive after the close of the present session of congress nothing have occur to interrupt the good understanding that have long exist with the barbary power nor to check the good will which be gradually grow up from our intercourse with the dominion of the government of grow of the distinguished chief of the ottoman empire information have be receive at the department of state that a treaty with the emperor of morocco have just be negotiate which i hope will be receive in time to be lay before the senate previous to the close of the session you will perceive from the report of the secretary of the treasury that the financial mean of the country continue to keep pace with its improvement in all other respect the receipt into the treasury during the present year    will amount to about $ 47,691,898 those from custom be estimate at $ 22,523,151 those from land at about $ 24,000,000 and the residue from miscellaneous source the expenditure for all object during the year be estimate not to exceed $ 32,000,000 which will leave a balance in the treasury for public purpose on the first day of january next of about $ 41,723,959 this sum with the exception of $ 5,000,000 will be transfer to the several state in accordance with the provision of the act regulate the deposit of the public money the unexpended balance of appropriation on the first day of january next be estimate at $ 14,636,062 exceed by $ 9,636,062 the amount which will be leave in the deposit bank subject to the draft of the treasurer of the united states after the contemplate transfer to the several state be make if therefore the future receipt should not be sufficient to meet these outstanding and future appropriation there may be soon a necessity to use a portion of the fund deposit with the state the consequence apprehend when the deposit act of the last session receive a reluctant approval have be measurably realize though an act merely for the deposit of the surplus money of the united states in the state treasury for safe keeping until they may be want for the service of the general government it have be extensively speak of as an act to give the money to the several state and they have be advise to use it as a gift without regard to the mean of refund it when call for such a suggestion have doubtless be make without a proper attention to the various principle and interest which be affect by it it be manifest that the law itself can not sanction such a suggestion and that as it now stand the states have no more authority to receive and use these deposit without intend to return they than any deposit bank or any individual temporarily charge with the safe keeping or application of the public money would now have for convert the same to their private use without the consent and against the will of the government but independently of the violation of public faith and moral obligation which be involve in this suggestion when examine in reference to the term of the present deposit act it be believe that the consideration which should govern the future legislation of congress on this subject will be equally conclusive against the adoption of any measure recognize the principle on which the suggestion have be make consider the intimate connection of the subject with the financial interest of the country and its great importance in whatever aspect it can be view i have bestow upon it the most anxious reflection and feel it to be my duty to state to congress such thought as have occur to i to aid their deliberation in treat it in the manner well calculate to conduce to the common good the experience of other nation admonish we to hasten the extinguishment of the public debt but it will be in vain that we have congratulate each other upon the disappearance of this evil if we do not guard against the equally great one of promote the unnecessary accumulation of public revenue no political maxim be well establish than that which tell we that an improvident expenditure of money be the parent of profligacy and that no people can hope to perpetuate their liberty who long acquiesce in a policy which tax they for object not necessary to the legitimate and real want of their government flatter as be the condition of our country at the present period because of its unexampled advance in all the step of social and political improvement it can not be disguise that there be a lurk danger already apparent in the neglect of this warning truth and that the time have arrive when the representative of the people should be employ in devise some more appropriate remedy than now exist to avert it under our present revenue system there be every probability that there will continue to be a surplus beyond the want of the government and it have become our duty to decide whether such a result be consistent with the true object of our government should a surplus be permit to accumulate beyond the appropriation it must be retain in the treasury as it now be or distribute among the people or the state to retain it in the treasury unemployed in any way be impracticable it be besides against the genius of our free institution to lock up in vault the treasure of the nation to take from the people the right of bear arm and put their weapon of defense in the hand of a stand army would be scarcely more dangerous to their liberty than to permit the government to accumulate immense amount of treasure beyond the supply necessary to its legitimate want such a treasure would doubtless be employ at some time as it have be in other country when opportunity tempt ambition to collect it merely for distribution to the state would seem to be highly impolitic if not as dangerous as the proposition to retain it in the treasury the short reflection must satisfy everyone that to require the people to pay taxis to the government merely that they may be pay back again be sport with the substantial interest of the country and no system which produce such a result can be expect to receive the public countenance nothing could be gain by it even if each individual who contribute a portion of the tax could receive back promptly the same portion but it be apparent that no system of the kind can ever be enforce which will not absorb a considerable portion of the money to be distribute in salary and commission to the agent employ in the process and in the various loss and depreciation which arise from other cause and the practical effect of such an attempt must ever be to burden the people with taxis not for purpose beneficial to they but to swell the profit of deposit bank and support a band of useless public officer a distribution to the people be impracticable and unjust in other respect it would be take one man 's property and give it to another such would be the unavoidable result of a rule of equality and none other be speak of or would be likely to be adopt in as much as there be no mode by which the amount of the individual contribution of our citizen to the public revenue can be ascertain we know that they contribute unequally and a rule therefore that would distribute to they equally would be liable to all the objection which apply to the principle of an equal division of property to make the general government the instrument of carry this odious principle into effect would be at once to destroy the mean of its usefulness and change the character design for it by the framer of the constitution but the more extended and injurious consequence likely to result from a policy which would collect a surplus revenue from the purpose of distribute it may be forcibly illustrate by an examination of the effect already produce by the present deposit act this act although certainly design to secure the safe keeping of the public revenue be not entirely free in its tendency from any of the objection which apply to this principle of distribution the government have without necessity receive from the people a large surplus which instead of be employ as heretofore and return to they by mean of the public expenditure be deposit with sundry bank the bank proceed to make loan upon this surplus and thus convert it into banking capital and in this manner it have tend to multiply bank charter and have have a great agency in produce a spirit of wild speculation the possession and use of the property out of which this surplus be create belong to the people but the government have transfer its possession to incorporate bank whose interest and effort it be to make large profit out of its use this process need only be state to show its injustice and bad policy and the same observation apply to the influence which be produce by the step necessary to collect as well as to distribute such a revenue about three fifth of all the duty on import be pay in the city of new york but it be obvious that the mean to pay those duty be draw from every quarter of the union every citizen in every state who purchase and consume an article which have pay a duty at that port contribute to the accumulate mass the surplus collect there must therefore be make up of money or property withdraw from other point and other state thus the wealth and business of every region from which these surplus fund proceed must be to some extent injure while that of the place where the fund be concentrated and be employ in banking be proportionably extend but both in make the transfer of the fund which be first necessary to pay the duty and collect the surplus and in make the re transfer which become necessary when the time arrive for the distribution of that surplus there be a considerable period when the fund can not be bring into use and it be manifest that besides the loss inevitable from such an operation its tendency be to produce fluctuation in the business of the country which be always productive of speculation and detrimental to the interest of regular trade argument can scarcely be necessary to show that a measure of this character ought not to receive further legislative encouragement by examine the practical operation of the ration for distribution adopt in the deposit bill of the last session we shall discover other feature that appear equally objectionable let it be assume for the sake of argument that the surplus money to be deposit with the state have be collect and belong to they in the ration of their federal representative population&mdash;an assumption found upon the fact that any deficiency in our future revenue from impost and public land must be make up by direct taxis collect from the state in that ration it be propose to distribute this surplus&mdash;say $ 30,000,000&mdash;not accord to the ration in which it have be collect and belong to the people of the state but in that of their vote in the college of elector of president and vice president the effect of a distribution upon that ration be show by the annexed table mark a.by an examination of that table it will be perceive that in the distribution of a surplus of $ 30,000,000 upon that basis there be a great departure from the principle which regard representation as the true measure of taxation and it will be find that the tendency of that departure will be to increase whatever inequality have be suppose to attend the operation of our federal system in respect to its bearing upon the different interest of the union in make the basis of representation the basis of taxation the framer of the constitution intend to equalize the burden which be necessary to support the government and the adoption of that ratio while it accomplish this object be also the mean of adjust other great topic arise out of the conflict view respect the political equality of the various member of the confederacy what ever therefore disturb the liberal spirit of the compromise which establish a rule of taxation so just and equitable and which experience have prove to be so well adapt to the genius and habit of our people should be receive with the great caution and distrust a bare inspection in the annexed table of the difference produce by the ration use in the deposit act compare with the result of a distribution accord to the ration of direct taxation must satisfy every unprejudiced mind that the former ration contravene the spirit of the constitution and produce a degree of injustice in the operation of the federal government which would be fatal to the hope of perpetuate it by the ration of direct taxation for example the state of delaware in the collection of $ 30,000,000 of revenue would pay into the treasury $ 188,716 and in a distribution of $ 30,000,000 she would receive back from the government accord to the ration of the deposit bill the sum of $ 306,122 and similar result would follow the comparison between the small and the large state throughout the union thus realize to the small state an advantage which would be doubtless as unacceptable to they as a motive for incorporate the principle in any system which would produce it as it would be inconsistent with the right and expectation of the large state it be certainly the intention of that provision of the constitution which declare that all duty impost and excise shall be uniform throughout the united states to make the burden of taxation fall equally upon the people in whatever state of the union they may reside but what would be the value of such a uniform rule if the money raise by it could be immediately return by a different one which will give to the people of some state much more and to those of other much less than their fair proportion be the federal government to exempt in express term the import product and manufacture of some portion of the country from all duty while it impose heavy one on other the injustice could not be great it would be easy to show how by the operation of such a principle the large state of the union would not only have to contribute their just share toward the support of the federal government but also have to bear in some degree the taxis necessary to support the government of their small sister but it be deem unnecessary to state the detail where the general principle be so obvious a system liable to such objection can never be suppose to have be sanction by the framer of the constitution when they confer on congress the tax power and i feel persuade that a mature examination of the subject will satisfy everyone that there be insurmountable difficulty in the operation of any plan which can be devise of collect revenue for the purpose of distribute it congress be only authorize to levy taxis to pay the debt and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united states there be no such provision as would authorize congress to collect together the property of the country under the name of revenue for the purpose of divide it equally or unequally among the state or the people indeed it be not probable that such an idea ever occur to the state when they adopt the constitution but however this may be the only safe rule for we in interpret the power grant to the federal government be to regard the absence of express authority to touch a subject so important and delicate as this as equivalent to a prohibition even if our power be less doubtful in this respect as the constitution now stand there be consideration afford by recent experience which would seem to make it our duty to avoid a resort to such a system all will admit that the simplicity and economy of the state government mainly depend on the fact that money have to be supply to support they by the same man or their agent who vote it away in appropriation hence when there be extravagant and wasteful appropriation there must be a corresponding increase of taxis and the people becoming awaken will necessarily scrutinize the character of measure which thus increase their burden by the watchful eye of self interest the agent of the people in the state government be repress and keep within the limit of a just economy but if the necessity of levy the taxis be take from those who make the appropriation and throw upon a more distant and less responsible set of public agent who have power to approach the people by an indirect and stealthy taxation there be reason to fear that prodigality will soon supersede those characteristic which have thus far make we look with so much pride and confidence to the state government as the mainstay of our union and liberty the state legislature instead of study to restrict their state expenditure to the small possible sum will claim credit for their profusion and harass the general government for increase supply practically there would soon be but one tax power and that vest in a body of man far remove from the people in which the farming and mechanic interest would scarcely be represent the state would gradually lose their purity as well as their independence they would not dare to murmur at the proceeding of the general government lest they should lose their supply all would be merge in a practical consolidation cement by widespread corruption which could only be eradicate by one of those bloody revolution which occasionally overthrow the despotic system of the old world in all the other aspect in which i have be able to look at the effect of such a principle of distribution upon the good interest of the country i can see nothing to compensate for the disadvantage to which i have advert if we consider the protective duty which be in a great degree the source of the surplus revenue beneficial to one section of the union and prejudicial to another there be no corrective for the evil in such a plan of distribution on the contrary there be reason to fear that all the complaint which have spring from this cause would be aggravate everyone must be sensible that a distribution of the surplus must beget a disposition to cherish the mean which create it and any system therefore into which it enter must have a powerful tendency to increase rather than diminish the tariff if it be even admit that the advantage of such a system could be make equal to all the section of the union the reason already so urgently call for a reduction of the revenue would never the less lose none of their force for it will always be improbable that an intelligent and virtuous community can consent to raise a surplus for the mere purpose of divide it diminish as it must inevitably be by the expense of the various machinery necessary to the process the safe and simple mode of obviate all the difficulty which have be mention be to collect only revenue enough to meet the want of the government and let the people keep the balance of their property in their own hand to be use for their own profit each state will then support its own government and contribute its due share toward the support of the general government there would be no surplus to cramp and lessen the resource of individual wealth and enterprise and the bank would be leave to their ordinary mean whatever agitation and fluctuation might arise from our unfortunate paper system they could never be attribute justly or unjustly to the action of the federal government there would be some guaranty that the spirit of wild speculation which seek to convert the surplus revenue into banking capital would be effectually check and that the scene of demoralization which be now so prevalent through the land would disappear without desire to conceal that the experience and observation of the last two year have operate a partial change in my view upon this interesting subject it be never the less regretted that the suggestion make by i in my annual message of 1829 and 1830 have be greatly misunderstood at that time the great struggle be begin against that latitudinarian construction of the constitution which authorize the unlimited appropriation of the revenue of the union to internal improvement within the state tend to invest in the hand and place under the control of the general government all the principal road and canal of the country in violation of state right and in derogation of state authority at the same time the condition of the manufacturing interest be such as to create an apprehension that the duty on import could not without extensive mischief be reduce in season to prevent the accumulation of a considerable surplus after the payment of the national debt in view of the danger of such a surplus and in preference to its application to internal improvement in derogation of the right and power of the state the suggestion of an amendment of the constitution to authorize its distribution be make it be an alternative for what be deem great evils&mdash;a temporary resort to relieve an over burden treasury until the government could without a sudden and destructive revulsion in the business of the country gradually return to the just principle of raise no more revenue from the people in taxis than be necessary for its economical support even that alternative be not speak of but in connection with an amendment of the constitution no temporary inconvenience can justify the exercise of a prohibit power not grant by that instrument and it be from a conviction that the power to distribute even a temporary surplus of revenue be of that character that it be suggest only in connection with an appeal to the source of all legal power in the general government the state which have establish it no such appeal have be take and in my opinion a distribution of the surplus revenue by congress either to the state or the people be to be consider as among the prohibition of the constitution as already intimate my view have undergo a change so far as to be convince that no alteration of the constitution in this respect be wise or expedient the influence of an accumulate surplus upon the credit system of the country produce dangerous extension and ruinous contraction fluctuation in the price of property rash speculation idleness extravagance and a deterioration of moral have teach we the important lesson that any transient mischief which may attend the reduction of our revenue to the want of our government be to be bear in preference to an overflowing treasury i beg leave to call your attention to another subject intimately associate with the precede one&mdash;the currency of the country it be apparent from the whole context of the constitution as well as the history of the time which give birth to it that it be the purpose of the convention to establish a currency consist of the precious metal these from their peculiar property which render they the standard of value in all other country be adopt in this as well to establish its commercial standard in reference to foreign country by a permanent rule as to exclude the use of a mutable medium of exchange such as of certain agricultural commodity recognize by the statute of some state as a tender for debt or the still more pernicious expedient of a paper currency the last from the experience of the evil of the issue of paper during the revolution have become so justly obnoxious as not only to suggest the clause in the constitution forbid the emission of bill of credit by the state but also to produce that vote in the convention which negative the proposition to grant power to congress to charter corporations&mdash;a proposition well understand at the time as intend to authorize the establishment of a national bank which be to issue a currency of bank note on a capital to be create to some extent out of government stock although this proposition be refuse by a direct vote of the convention the object be afterwards in effect obtain by its ingenious advocate through a strained construction of the constitution the debt of the revolution be fund at price which form no equivalent compare with the nominal amount of the stock and under circumstance which expose the motive of some of those who participate in the passage of the act to distrust the fact that the value of the stock be greatly enhance by the creation of the bank that it be well understand that such would be the case and that some of the advocate of the measure be largely benefit by it belong to the history of the time and be well calculate to diminish the respect which might otherwise have be due to the action of the congress which create the institution on the establishment of a national bank it become the interest of its creditor that gold should be supersede by the paper of the bank as a general currency a value be soon attach to the gold coin which make their exportation to foreign country as a mercantile commodity more profitable than their retention and use at home as money it follow as a matter of course if not design by those who establish the bank that the bank become in effect a substitute for the mint of the united states such be the origin of a national bank currency and such the beginning of those difficulty which now appear in the excessive issue of the bank incorporate by the various states although it may not be possible by any legislative mean within our power to change at once the system which have thus be introduce and have receive the acquiescence of all portion of the country it be certainly our duty to do    all that be consistent with our constitutional obligation in prevent the mischief which be threaten by its undue extension that the effort of the father of our government to guard against it by a constitutional provision be found on an intimate knowledge of the subject have be frequently attest by the bitter experience of the country the same cause which lead they to refuse their sanction to a power authorize the establishment of incorporation for banking purpose now exist in a much strong degree to urge we to exert the utmost vigilance in call into action    the mean necessary to correct the evil result from the unfortunate exercise of the power and it be hope that the opportunity for effect this great good will be improve before the country witness new scene of embarrassment and distress variableness must ever be the characteristic of a currency of which the precious metal be not the chief ingredient or which can be expand or contract without regard to the principle that regulate the value of those metal as a standard in the general trade of the world with us bank issue constitute such a currency and must ever do so until they be make dependent on those just proportion of gold and silver as a circulate medium which experience have prove to be necessary not only in this but in all other commercial country where those proportion be not infuse into the circulation and do not control it it be manifest that price must vary accord to the tide of bank issue and the value and stability of property must stand expose to all the uncertainty which attend the administration of institution that be constantly liable to the temptation of an interest distinct from that of the community in which they be establish the progress of an expansion or rather a depreciation of the currency by excessive bank issue be always attend by a loss to the labor class this portion of the community have neither time nor opportunity to watch the ebb and flow of the money market engage from day to day in their useful toil they do not perceive that although their wage be nominally the same or even somewhat high they be greatly reduce in fact by the rapid increase of a spurious currency which as it appear to make money abound they be at first incline to consider a blessing it be not so with the speculator by whom this operation be well understand and be make to contribute to his advantage it be not until the price of the necessary of life become so dear that the labor class can not supply their want out of their wage that the wage rise and gradually reach a justly proportion rate to that of the product of their labor when thus by depreciation in consequence of the quantity of paper in circulation wage as well as price become exorbitant it be soon find that the whole effect of the adulteration be a tariff on our home industry for the benefit of the country where gold and silver circulate and maintain uniformity and moderation in price it be then perceive that the enhancement of the price of land and labor produce a corresponding increase in the price of product until these product do not sustain a competition with similar one in other country and thus both manufactured and agricultural production cease to bear expectation from the country of the spurious currency because they can not be sell for cost this be the process by which specie be banish by the paper of the bank their vault be soon exhausted to pay for foreign commodity the next step be a stoppage of specie payment&mdash;a total degradation of paper as a currency&mdash;unusual depression of price the ruin of debtor and the accumulation of property in the hand of creditor and cautious capitalist it be in view of these evil together with the dangerous power wield by the bank of the united states and its repugnance to our constitution that i be induce to exert the power confer upon i by the american people to prevent the continuance of that institution but although various danger to our republican institution have be obviate by the failure of that bank to extort from the government a renewal of its charter it be obvious that little have be accomplish except a salutary change of public opinion toward restore to the country the sound currency provide for in the constitution in the act of several of the state prohibit the circulation of small note and the auxiliary enactment of congress at the last session forbid their reception or payment on public account the true policy of the country have be advance and a large portion of the precious metal infuse into our circulate medium these measure will probably be follow up in due time by the enactment of state law banish from circulation bank note of still high denomination and the object may be materially promote by further act of congress forbid the employment as fiscal agent of such bank as continue to issue note of low denomination and throw impediment in the way of the circulation of gold and silver the effect of an extension of bank credit and over issue of bank paper have be strikingly illustrate in the sale of the public land from the return make by the various register and receiver in the early part of last summer it be perceive that the receipt arise from the sale of the public land be increase to an unprecedented amount in effect however these receipt amount to nothing more than credit in bank the bank lend out their note to speculator they be pay to the receiver and immediately return to the bank to be lend out again and again be mere instrument to transfer to speculator the most valuable public land and pay the government by a credit on the book of the bank those credit on the book of some of the western bank usually call deposit be already greatly beyond their immediate mean of payment and be rapidly increase indeed each speculation furnish mean for another for no soon have one individual or company pay in the note than they be immediately lend to another for a like purpose and the bank be extend their business and their issue so largely as to alarm considerate man and render it doubtful whether these bank credit if permit to accumulate would ultimately be of the least value to the government the spirit of expansion and speculation be not confine to the deposit bank but pervade the whole multitude of bank throughout the union and be give rise to new institution to aggravate the evil the safety of the public fund and the interest of the people generally require that these operation should be check and it become the duty of every branch of the general and state government to adopt all legitimate and proper mean to produce that salutary effect under this view of my duty i direct the issuing of the order which will be lay before you by the secretary of the treasury require payment for the public land sell to be make in specie with an exception until the 15th of the present month in favor of actual settler this measure have produce many salutary consequence it check the career of the western bank and give they additional strength in anticipation of the pressure which have since pervade our eastern as well as the european commercial city by prevent the extension of the credit system it measurably cut off the mean of speculation and retard its progress in monopolize the most valuable of the public land it have tend to save the new state from a non resident proprietorship one of the great obstacle to the advancement of a new country and the prosperity of an old one it have tend to keep open the public land for entry by emigrant at government price instead of their be compel to purchase of speculator at double or triple price and it be convey into the interior large sum in silver and gold there to enter permanently into the currency of the country and place it on a firm foundation it be confidently believe that the country will find in the motive which induce that order and the happy consequence which will have ensue much to commend and nothing to condemn it remain for congress if they approve the policy which dictate this order to follow it up in its various bearing much good in my judgment would be produce by prohibit sale of the public land except to actual settler at a reasonable reduction of price and to limit the quantity which shall be sell to they although it be believe the general government never ought to receive anything but the constitutional currency in exchange for the public land that point would be of less importance if the land be sell for immediate settlement and cultivation indeed there be scarcely a mischief arise out of our present land system include the accumulate surplus of revenue which would not be remedie at once by a restriction on land sale to actual settler and it promise other advantage to the country in general and to the new state in particular which can not fail to receive the most profound consideration of congress experience continue to realize the expectation entertain as to the capacity of the state bank to perform the duty of fiscal agent for the government at the time of the removal of the deposit it be allege by the advocate of the bank of the united states that the state bank what ever might be the regulation of the treasury department could not make the transfer require by the government or negotiate the domestic exchange of the country it be now well ascertain that the real domestic exchange perform through discount by the united states bank and its 25 branch be at least one third less than those of the deposit bank for an equal period of time and if a comparison be institute between the amount of service render by these institution on the broad basis which have be use by the advocate of the united states bank in estimate what they consider the domestic exchange transact by it the result will be still more favorable to the deposit bank the whole amount of public money transfer by the bank of the united states in 1832 be $ 16,000,000 the amount transfer and actually pay by the deposit bank in the year end the 1st of october last be $ 39,319,899 the amount transfer and pay between that period and the 6th of november be $ 5,399,000 and the amount of transfer warrant outstanding on that day be $ 14,450,000 make an aggregate of $ 59,168,894 these enormous sum of money first mention have be transfer with the great promptitude and regularity and the rate at which the exchange have be negotiate previously to the passage of the deposit act be generally below those charge by the bank of the united states independently of these service which be far great than those render by the united states bank and its 25 branch a number of the deposit bank have with a commendable zeal to aid in the improvement of the currency import from abroad at their own expense large sum of the precious metal for coinage and circulation in the same manner have nearly all the prediction turn out in respect to the effect of the removal of the deposits&mdash;a step unquestionably necessary to prevent the evil which it be foresee the bank itself would endeavor to create in a final struggle to procure a renewal of its charter it may be thus too in some degree with the further step which may be take to prevent the excessive issue of other bank paper but it be to be hope that nothing will now deter the federal and state authority from the firm and vigorous performance of their duty to themselves and to the people in this respect in reduce the revenue to the want of the government your particular attention be invite to those article which constitute the necessary of life the duty on salt be lay as a war tax and be no doubt continue to assist in provide for the payment of the war debt there be no article the release of which from taxation would be feel so generally and so beneficially to this may be add all kind of fuel and provision justice and benevolence unite in favor of release the poor of our city from burden which be not necessary to the support of our government and tend only to increase the want of the destitute it will be see by the report of the secretary of the treasury and the accompany document that the bank of the united states have make no payment on account of the stock hold by the government in that institution although urge to pay any portion which might suit its convenience and that it have give no information when payment may be expect nor although repeatedly request have it furnish the information in relation to its condition which congress authorize the secretary to collect at their last session such measure as be within the power of the executive have be take to ascertain the value of the stock and procure the payment as early as possible the conduct and present condition of that bank and the great amount of capital vest in it by the united states require your careful attention its charter expire on the third day of march last and it have now no power but that give in the 21st section to use the corporate name style and capacity for the purpose of suit for the final settlement and liquidation of the affair and account of the corporation and for the sale and disposition of their estate&mdash;real personal and mixed&mdash;but not for any other purpose or in any other manner what so ever nor for a period exceed two year after the expiration of the say term of incorporation "before the expiration of the charter the stock holder of the bank obtain an act of incorporation from the legislature of pennsylvania exclude only the united states instead of proceed to wind up their concern and pay over to the united states the amount due on account of the stock hold by they the president and director of the old bank appear to have transfer the book paper note obligation and most or all of its property to this new corporation which enter upon business as a continuation of the old concern amongst other act of questionable validity the note of the expired corporation be know to have be use as its own and again put in circulation that the old bank have no right to issue or re issue its note after the expiration of its charter can not be deny and that it could not confer any such right on its substitute any more than exercise it itself be equally plain in law and honesty the note of the bank in circulation at the expiration of its charter should have be call in by public advertisement pay up as present and together with those on hand cancel and destroy their re issue be sanction by no law and warrant by no necessity if the united states be responsible in their stock for the payment of these note their re issue by the new corporation for their own profit be a fraud on the government if the united states be not responsible then there be no legal responsibility in any quarter and it be a fraud on the country they be the redeem note of a dissolve partnership but contrary to the wish of the retire partner and without his consent be again re issue and circulate it be the high and peculiar duty of congress to decide whether any further legislation be necessary for the security of the large amount of public property now hold and in use by the new bank and for vindicate the right of the government and compel a speedy and honest settlement with all the creditor of the old bank public and private or whether the subject shall be leave to the power now possess by the executive and judiciary it remain to be see whether the person who as manager of the old bank undertake to control the government retain the public dividend shut their door upon a committee of the house of representatives and fill the country with panic to accomplish their own sinister object may now as manager of a new bank continue with impunity to flood the country with a spurious currency use the $ 7 million of government stock for their own profit and refuse to the united states all information as to the present condition of their own property and the prospect of recover it into their own possession the lesson teach by the bank of the united states can not well be lose upon the american people they will take care never again to place so tremendous a power in irresponsible hand and it will be fortunate if they seriously consider the consequence which be likely to result on a small scale from the facility with which corporate power be grant by their state government it be believe that the law of the last session regulate the deposit bank operate onerously and unjustly upon they in many respect and it be hope that congress on proper representation will adopt the modification which be necessary to prevent this consequence the report of the secretary of war ad interim and the accompany document all which be herewith lay before you will give you a full view of the diversified and important operation of that department during the past year the military movement render necessary by the aggression of the hostile portion of the seminole and creek tribe of indians and by other circumstance have require the active employment of nearly our whole regular force include the marine corps and of large body of militia and volunteer with all these event so far as they be know at the seat of government before the termination of your last session you be already acquaint and it be therefore only needful in this place to lay before you a brief summary of what have since occur the war with the seminoles during the summer be on our part chiefly confine to the protection of our frontier settlement from the incursion of the enemy and as a necessary and important mean for the accomplishment of that end to the maintenance of the post previously establish in the course of this duty several action take place in which the bravery and discipline of both officer and man be conspicuously display and which i have deem it proper to notice in respect to the former by the granting of brevet rank for gallant service in the field but as the force of the indians be not so far weaken by these partial success as to lead they to submit and as their savage inroad be frequently repeat early measure be take for place at the disposal of governor call who as commander in chief of the territorial militia have be temporarily invest with the command an ample force for the purpose of resume offensive operation in the most efficient manner so soon as the season should permit major general jesup be also direct on the conclusion of his duty in the creek country to repair to florida and assume the command the result of the first movement make by the force under the direction of governor call in october last as detail in the accompany paper excite much surprise and disappointment a full explanation have be require of the cause which lead to the failure of that movement but have not yet be receive in the mean time as it be fear that the health of governor call who be understand to have suffer much from sickness might not be adequate to the crisis and as major general jesup be know to have reach florida that officer be direct to assume command and to prosecute all needful operation with the utmost promptitude and vigor from the force at his disposal and the disposition he have make and be instruct to make and from the very efficient measure which it be since ascertained have be take by governor call there be reason to hope that they will soon be enable to reduce the enemy to subjection in the mean time as you will perceive from the report of the secretary there be urgent necessity for further appropriation to suppress these hostility happily for the interest of humanity the hostility with the creeks be bring to a close soon after your adjournment without that effusion of blood which at one time be apprehend as inevitable the unconditional submission of the hostile party be follow by their speedy removal to the country assign they west of the mississippi the inquiry as to alleged fraud in the purchase of the reservation of these indians and the cause of their hostility request by the resolution of the house of representatives of the 1st of july last 1836 07 01 to be make by the president be now go on through the agency of commissioner appoint for that purpose their report may be expect during your present session the difficulty apprehend in the cherokee country have be prevent and the peace and safety of that region and its vicinity effectually secure by the timely measure take by the war department and still continue the discretionary authority give to general gaines to cross the sabine and to occupy a position as far west as nacogdoches in case he should deem such a step necessary to the protection of the frontier and to the fulfillment of the stipulation contain in our treaty with mexico and the movement subsequently make by that officer have be allude to in a former part of this message at the date of the late intelligence from nacogdoches our troop be yet at that station but the officer who have succeed general gaines have recently be advise that from the fact know at the seat of government there would seem to be no adequate cause for any long maintain that position and he be accordingly instruct in case the troop be not already withdraw under the discretionary power before possess by he to give the requisite order for that purpose on the receipt of the instruction unless he shall then have in his possession such information as shall satisfy he that the maintenance of the post be essential to the protection of our frontier and to the due execution of our treaty stipulation as previously explain to he whilst the necessity exist during the present year for the service of militia and volunteer have furnish new proof of the patriotism of our fellow citizen they have also strongly illustrate the importance of an increase in the rank and file of the regular army the view of this subject submit by the secretary of war in his report meet my entire concurrence and be earnestly commend to the deliberate attention of congress in this connection it be also proper to remind you that the defect in our present militia system be every day render more apparent the duty of make further provision by law for organize arming and discipline this arm of defense have be so repeatedly present to congress by myself and my predecessor that i deem it sufficient on this occasion to refer to the last annual message and to former executive communication in which the subject have be discuss it appear from the report of the officer charge with muster into service the volunteer call for under the act of congress of the last session that more present themselves at the place of rendezvous in tennessee than be sufficient to meet the requisition which have be make by the secretary of war upon the governor of that state this be occasion by the omission of the governor to apportion the requisition to the different regiment of militia so as to obtain the proper number of troop and no more it seem but just to the patriotic citizen who repair to the general rendezvous under circumstance authorize they to believe that their service be need and would be accept that the expense incur by they while absent from their home should be pay by the government i accordingly recommend that a law to this effect be pass by congress give they a compensation which will cover their expense on the march to and from the place of rendezvous and while there in connection with which it will also be proper to make provision for such other equitable claim grow out of the service of the militia as may not be embrace in the exist law on the unexpected breaking out of hostility in florida alabama and georgia it become necessary in some case to take the property of individual for public use provision should be make by law for indemnify the owner and i would also respectfully suggest whether some provision may not be make consistently with the principle of our government for the relief of the sufferer by indian depredation or by the operation of our own troop no time be lose after the making of the requisite appropriation in resume the great national work of complete the unfinished fortification on our sea board and of place they in a proper state of defense in consequence however of the very late day at which those bill be pass but little progress could be make during the season which have just close a very large amount of the money grant at your last session accordingly remain unexpended but as the work will be again resume at the early moment in the come spring the balance of the exist appropriation and in several case which will be lay before you with the proper estimate further sum for the like object may be usefully expend during the next year the recommendation of an increase in the engineer corps and for a reorganization of the topographical corps submit to you in my last annual message derive additional strength from the great embarrassment experience during the present year in those branch of the service and under which they be now suffer several of the most important survey and construction direct by recent law have be suspend in consequence of the want of adequate force in these corps the like observation may be apply to the ordnance corps and to the general staff the operation of which as they be now organized must either be frequently interrupt or perform by officer take from the line of the army to the great prejudice of the service for a general view of the condition of the military academy and of other branch of the military service not already notice as well as for further illustration of those

entitle to your profound consideration both measure be necessary for the double purpose of protect the indians from intestine war and in other respect comply with our engagement with they and of secure our western frontier against incursion which otherwise will assuredly be make on it the good hope of humanity in regard to the aboriginal race the welfare of our rapidly extend settlement and the honor of the united states be all deeply involve in the relation exist between this government and the emigrate tribe i trust therefore that the various matter submit in the accompany document in respect to those relation will receive your early and mature deliberation and that it may issue in the adoption of legislative measure adapt to the circumstance and duty of the present crisis you be refer to the report of the secretary of the navy for a satisfactory view of the operation of the department under his charge during the present year in the construction of vessel at the different navy yard and in the employment of our ship and squadron at sea that branch of the service have be actively and usefully employ while the situation of our commercial interest in the west indies require a great number than usual of armed vessel to be keep on that station it be gratify to perceive that the protection due to our commerce in other quarter of the world have not prove insufficient every effort have be make to facilitate the equipment of the explore expedition authorize by the act of the last session but all the preparation necessary to enable it to sail have not yet be complete no mean will be spare by the government to fit out the expedition on a scale correspond with the liberal appropriation for the purpose and with the elevated character of the object which be to be effect by it i beg leave to renew the recommendation make in my last annual message respect the enlistment of boy in our naval service and to urge upon your attention the necessity of further appropriation to increase the number of ship afloat and to enlarge generally the capacity and force of the navy the increase of our commerce and our position in regard to the other power of the world will always make it our policy and interest to cherish the great naval resource of our country the report of the postmaster general present a gratify picture of the condition of the post office department its revenue for the year end the 30th june last be $ 3,398,455.19 show an increase of revenue over that of the precede year of $ 404,878.53 or more than 13 percent the expenditure for the same year be $ 2,755,623.76 exhibit a surplus of $ 642,831.43 the department have be redeem from embarrassment and debt have accumulate a surplus exceed half a million dollar have largely extend and be prepare still far to extend the mail service and recommend a reduction of postage equal to about 20 percent it be practice upon the great principle which should control every branch of our government of render to the public the great good possible with the least possible taxation to the people the scale of postage suggest by the postmaster general recommend itself not only by the reduction it propose but by the simplicity of its arrangement its conformity with the federal currency and the improvement it will introduce into the account of the department and its agent your particular attention be invite to the subject of mail contract with railroad company the present law provide for the making of contract be base upon the presumption that competition among bidder will secure the service at a fair price but on most of the railroad line there be no competition in that kind of transportation and advertising be therefore useless no contract can now be make with they except such as shall be negotiate before the time of offering or afterwards and the power of the postmaster general to pay they high price be practically without limitation it would be a relief to he and no doubt would conduce to the public interest to prescribe by law some equitable basis upon which such contract shall rest and restrict he by a fix rule of allowance under a liberal act of that sort he would undoubtedly be able to secure the service of most of the railroad company and the interest of the department would be thus advanced the correspondence between the people of the united states and the european nation and particularly with the british islands have become very extensive and require the interposition of congress to give it security no obstacle be perceive to an interchange of mail between new york and liverpool or other foreign port as propose by the postmaster general on the contrary it promise by the security it will afford to facilitate commercial transaction and give rise to an enlarged intercourse among the people of different nation which can not but have a happy effect through the city of new york most of the correspondence between the canadas and europe be now carry on and urgent representation have be receive from the head of the provincial post office ask the interposition of the united states to guard it from the accident and loss to which it be now subject some legislation appear to be call for as well by our own interest as by comity to the adjoining british province the expediency of provide a fire proof building for the important book and paper of the post office department be worthy of consideration in the present condition of our treasury it be neither necessary nor wise to leave essential public interest expose to so much danger when they can so readily be make secure there be weighty consideration in the location of a new building for that department in favor of place it near the other executive building the important subject of a survey of the coast and the manufacture of a standard of weight and measure for the different custom house have be in progress for some year under the general direction of the executive and the immediate superintendence of a gentleman possess high scientific attainment at the last session of congress the making of a set of weight and measure for each state in the union be add to the other by a joint resolution the care and correspondence as to all these subject have be devolve on the treasury department during the last year a special report from the secretary of the treasury will soon be communicate to congress which will show what have be accomplish as to the whole the number and compensation of the person now employ in these duty and the progress expect to be make during the ensue year with a copy of the various correspondence deem necessary to throw light on the subject which seem to require additional legislation claim have be make for retrospective allowance in behalf of the superintendent and some of his assistant which i do not feel justified in grant other claim have be make for large increase in compensation which under the circumstance of the several case i decline make without the express sanction of congress in order to obtain that sanction the subject be at the last session on my suggestion and by request of the immediate superintendent submit by the treasury department to the committee on commerce of the house of representatives but no legislative action having take place the early attention of congress be now invite to the enactment of some express and detailed provision in relation to the various claim make for the past and to the compensation and allowance deem proper for the future it be far respectfully recommend that such be the inconvenience of attention to these duty by the chief magistrate and such the great pressure of business on the treasury department the general supervision of the coast survey and the completion of the weight and measure if the work be keep united should be devolve on a board of officer organize specially for that purpose or on the navy board attach to the navy department all my experience and reflection confirm the conviction i have so often express to congress in favor of an amendment of the constitution which will prevent in any event the election of the president and vice president of the united states devolving on the house of representatives and the senate and i therefore beg leave again to solicit your attention to the subject there be various other suggestion in my last annual message not act upon particularly that relate to the want of uniformity in the law of the district of columbia that be deem worthy of your favorable consideration before conclude this paper i think it due to the various executive department to bear testimony to their prosperous condition and to the ability and integrity with which they have be conduct it have be my aim to enforce in all of they a vigilant and faithful discharge of the public business and it be gratify to i to believe that there be no just cause of complaint from any quarter at the manner in which they have fulfil the object of their creation having now finish the observation deem proper on this the last occasion i shall have of communicate with the two houses of congress at their meeting i can not omit an expression of the gratitude which be due to the great body of my fellow citizen in whose partiality and indulgence i have find encouragement and support in the many difficult and try scene through which it have be my lot to pass during my public career though deeply sensible that my exertion have not be crown with a success correspond to the degree of favor bestow upon i i be sure that they will be consider as having be direct by an earnest desire to promote the good of my country and i be console by the persuasion that what ever error have be commit will find a corrective in the intelligence and patriotism of those who will succeed we all that have occur during my administration be calculate to inspire i with increase confidence in the stability of our institution and should i be spare to enter upon that retirement which be so suitable to my age and infirm health and so much desire by i in other respect i shall not cease to invoke that beneficent be to whose providence we be already so signally indebted for the continuance of his blessing on our beloved country
to the senate and house of representatives of the united states
 during the last session information be give to congress by the executive that measure have be take to ascertain the political military and civil condition of texas i now submit for your consideration extract from the report of the agent who have be appoint to collect it relative to the condition of that country
 no step have be take by the executive toward the acknowledgment of the independence of texas and the whole subject would have be leave without further remark on the information now give to congress be it not that the two houses at their last session act separately pass resolution that the independence of texas ought to be acknowledge by the united states whenever satisfactory information should be receive that it have in successful operation a civil government capable of perform the duty and fulfil the obligation of an independent power this mark of interest in the question of the independence of texas and indication of the view of congress make it proper that i should somewhat in detail present the consideration that have govern the executive in continue to occupy the ground previously take in the contest between mexico and texas
 the acknowledgment of a new state as independent and entitle to a place in the family of nation be at all time an act of great delicacy and responsibility but more especially so when such state have forcibly separate itself from another of which it have form an integral part and which still claim dominion over it a premature recognition under these circumstance if not look upon as justifiable cause of war be always liable to be regard as a proof of an unfriendly spirit to one of the contend party all question relative to the government of foreign nation whether of the old or the new world have be treat by the united states as question of fact only and our predecessor have cautiously abstain from decide upon they until the clear evidence be in their possession to enable they not only to decide correctly but to shield their decision from every unworthy imputation in all the contest that have arise out of the revolution of france out of the dispute relate to the crown of portugal and spain out of the revolutionary movement of those kingdom out of the separation of the american possession of both from the european governments and out of the numerous and constantly occur struggle for dominion in spanish america so wisely consistent with our just principle have be the action of our government that we have under the most critical circumstance avoid all censure and encounter no other evil than that produce by a transient estrangement of good will in those against whom we have be by force of evidence compel to decide
 it have thus be make known to the world that the uniform policy and practice of the united states be to avoid all interference in dispute which merely relate to the internal government of other nation and eventually to recognize the authority of the prevail party without reference to our particular interest and view or to the merit of the original controversy public opinion here be so firmly establish and well understand in favor of this policy that no serious disagreement have ever arise among ourselves in relation to it although bring under review in a variety of form and at period when the mind of the people be greatly excited by the agitation of topic purely domestic in their character nor have any deliberate inquiry ever be institute in congress or in any of our legislative body as to whom belong the power of originally recognize a new state a power the exercise of which be equivalent under some circumstance to a declaration of war a power nowhere expressly delegate and only grant in the constitution as it be necessarily involve in some of the great power give to congress in that give to the president and senate to form treaty with foreign power and to appoint ambassador and other public minister and in that confer upon the president to receive minister from foreign nation
 in the preamble to the resolution of the house of representatives it be distinctly intimated that the expediency of recognize the independence of texas should be leave to the decision of congress in this view on the ground of expediency i be disposed to concur and do not therefore consider it necessary to express any opinion as to the strict constitutional right of the executive either apart from or in conjunction with the senate over the subject it be to be presume that on no future occasion will a dispute arise as none have heretofore occur between the executive and legislature in the exercise of the power of recognition it will always be consider consistent with the spirit of the constitution and most safe that it should be exercise when probably lead to war with a previous understanding with that body by whom war can alone be declare and by whom all the provision for sustain its peril must be furnish its submission to congress which represent in one of its branch the states of this union and in the other the people of the united states where there may be reasonable ground to apprehend so grave a consequence would certainly afford the full satisfaction to our own country and a perfect guaranty to all other nation of the justice and prudence of the measure which might be adopt
 in make these suggestion it be not my purpose to relieve myself from the responsibility of express my own opinion of the course the interest of our country prescribe and its honor permit we to follow
 it be scarcely to be imagine that a question of this character could be present in relation to which it would be more difficult for the united states to avoid excite the suspicion and jealousy of other power and maintain their establish character for fair and impartial dealing but on this as on every try occasion safety be to be find in a rigid adherence to principle
 in the contest between spain and her revolted colony we stand aloof and wait not only until the ability of the new states to protect themselves be fully establish but until the danger of their be again subjugate have entirely pass away then and not till then be they recognize such be our course in regard to mexico herself the same policy be observe in all the dispute grow out of the separation into distinct government of those spanish american states who begin or carry on the contest with the parent country unite under one form of government we acknowledge the separate independence of new granada of venezuela and of ecuador only after their independent existence be no long a subject of dispute or be actually acquiesce in by those with whom they have be previously unite it be true that with regard to texas the civil authority of mexico have be expel its invade army defeat the chief of the republic himself capture and all present power to control the newly organize government of texas annihilate within its confine but on the other hand there be in appearance at least an immense disparity of physical force on the side of mexico the mexican republic under another executive be rally its force under a new leader and menace a fresh invasion to recover its lose dominion
 upon the issue of this threaten invasion the independence of texas may be consider as suspend and be there nothing peculiar in the relative situation of the united states and texas our acknowledgment of its independence at such a crisis could scarcely be regard as consistent with that prudent reserve with which we have heretofore hold ourselves bind to treat all similar question but there be circumstance in the relation of the two country which require we to act on this occasion with even more than our wonte caution texas be once claim as a part of our property and there be those among our citizen who always reluctant to abandon that claim can not but regard with solicitude the prospect of the reunion of the territory to this country a large proportion of its civilized inhabitant be emigrant from the united states speak the same language with ourselves cherish the same principle political and religious and be bind to many of our citizen by tie of friendship and kindre blood and more than all it be know that the people of that country have institute the same form of government with our own and have since the close of your last session openly resolve on the acknowledgment by we of their independence to seek admission into the union as one of the federal states this last circumstance be a matter of peculiar delicacy and force upon we consideration of the grave character the title of texas to the territory she claim be identify with her independence she ask we to acknowledge that title to the territory with an avowed design to treat immediately of its transfer to the united states it become we to beware of a too early movement as it might subject we however unjustly to the imputation of seek to establish the claim of our neighbor to a territory with a view to its subsequent acquisition by ourselves prudence therefore seem to dictate that we should still stand aloof and maintain our present attitude if not until mexico itself or one of the great foreign power shall recognize the independence of the new government at least until the lapse of time or the course of event shall have prove beyond cavil or dispute the ability of the people of that country to maintain their separate sovereignty and to uphold the government constitute by they neither of the contend party can justly complain of this course by pursue it we be but carry out the long establish policy of our government a policy which have secure to we respect and influence abroad and inspire confidence at home
 having thus discharge my duty by present with simplicity and directness the view which after much reflection i have be lead to take of this important subject i have only to add the expression of my confidence that if congress shall differ with i upon it their judgment will be the result of dispassionate prudent and wise deliberation with the assurance that during the short time i shall continue connect with the government i shall promptly and cordially unite with you in such measure as may be deem well fit to increase the prosperity and perpetuate the peace of our favored country

fellow citizen the practice of all my predecessor impose on i an obligation i cheerfully fulfill to accompany the first and solemn act of my public trust with an avowal of the principle that will guide i in perform it and an expression of my feeling on assume a charge so responsible and vast in imitate their example i tread in the footstep of illustrious man whose superior it be our happiness to believe be not find on the executive calendar of any country among they we recognize the early and firmest pillar of the republic those by whom our national independence be first declare he who above all other contribute to establish it on the field of battle and those whose expand intellect and patriotism construct improve and perfect the inestimable institution under which we live if such man in the position i now occupy feel themselves overwhelm by a sense of gratitude for this the high of all mark of their country 's confidence and by a consciousness of their inability adequately to discharge the duty of an office so difficult and exalted how much more must these consideration affect one who can rely on no such claim for favor or forbearance unlike all who have precede i the revolution that give we existence as one people be achieve at the period of my birth and whilst i contemplate with grateful reverence that memorable event i feel that i belong to a later age and that i may not expect my countryman to weigh my action with the same kind and partial hand   so sensibly fellow citizen do these circumstance press themselves upon i that i should not dare to enter upon my path of duty do i not look for the generous aid of those who will be associate with i in the various and coordinate branch of the government do i not repose with unwavering reliance on the patriotism the intelligence and the kindness of a people who never yet desert a public servant honestly labor their cause and above all do i not permit myself humbly to hope for the sustain support of an ever watchful and beneficent providence to the confidence and consolation derive from these source it would be ungrateful not to add those which spring from our present fortunate condition though not altogether exempt from embarrassment that disturb our tranquillity at home and threaten it abroad yet in all the attribute of a great happy and flourish people we stand without a parallel in the world abroad we enjoy the respect and with scarcely an exception the friendship of every nation at home while our government quietly but efficiently perform the sole legitimate end of political institution in do the great good to the great number we present an aggregate of human prosperity surely not elsewhere to be find how imperious then be the obligation impose upon every citizen in his own sphere of action whether limited or extend to exert himself in perpetuate a condition of thing so singularly happy all the lesson of history and experience must be lose upon we if we be content to trust alone to the peculiar advantage we happen to possess position and climate and the bounteous resource that nature have scatter with so liberal a hand even the diffused intelligence and elevated character of our people will avail we nothing if we fail sacredly to uphold those political institution that be wisely and deliberately form with reference to every circumstance that could preserve or might endanger the blessing we enjoy the thoughtful framer of our constitution legislate for our country as they find it look upon it with the eye of statesman and patriot they see all the source of rapid and wonderful prosperity but they see also that various habit opinion and institution peculiar to the various portion of so vast a region be deeply fix distinct sovereignty be in actual existence whose cordial union be essential to the welfare and happiness of all between many of they there be at least to some extent a real diversity of interest liable to be exaggerate through sinister design they differ in size in population in wealth and in actual and prospective resource and power they vary in the character of their industry and staple production and in some exist domestic institution which unwisely disturb might endanger the harmony of the whole most carefully be all these circumstance weigh and the foundation of the new government lay upon principle of reciprocal concession and equitable compromise the jealousy which the small states might entertain of the power of the rest be allay by a rule of representation confessedly unequal at the time and design forever to remain so a natural fear that the broad scope of general legislation might bear upon and unwisely control particular interest be counteract by limit strictly draw around the action of the federal authority and to the people and the states be leave unimpaire their sovereign power over the innumerable subject embrace in the internal government of a just republic except such only as necessarily appertain to the concern of the whole confederacy or its intercourse as a united community with the other nation of the world this provident forecast have be verify by time half a century teem with extraordinary event and elsewhere produce astonishing result have pass along but on our institution it have leave no injurious mark from a small community we have rise to a people powerful in number and in strength but with our increase have go hand in hand the progress of just principle the privilege civil and religious of the humblest individual be still sacredly protect at home and while the valor and fortitude of our people have remove far from we the slight apprehension of foreign power they have not yet induce we in a single instance to forget what be right our commerce have be extend to the remotest nation the value and even nature of our production have be greatly change a wide difference have arise in the relative wealth and resource of every portion of our country yet the spirit of mutual regard and of faithful adherence to exist compact have continue to prevail in our council and never long be absent from our conduct we have learn by experience a fruitful lesson that an implicit and undeviating adherence to the principle on which we set out can carry we prosperously onward through all the conflict of circumstance and vicissitude inseparable from the lapse of year the success that have thus attend our great experiment be in itself a sufficient cause for gratitude on account of the happiness it have actually confer and the example it have unanswerably give but to i my fellow citizen look forward to the far distant future with ardent prayer and confide hope this retrospect present a ground for still deep delight it impress on my mind a firm belief that the perpetuity of our institution depend upon ourselves that if we maintain the principle on which they be establish they be destine to confer their benefit on countless generation yet to come and that america will present to every friend of mankind the cheer proof that a popular government wisely form be want in no element of endurance or strength fifty year ago its rapid failure be boldly predict latent and uncontrollable cause of dissolution be suppose to exist even by the wise and good and not only do unfriendly or speculative theorist anticipate for we the fate of past republic but the fear of many an honest patriot overbalance his sanguine hope look back on these foreboding not hastily but reluctantly make and see how in every instance they have completely fail an imperfect experience during the struggle of the revolution be suppose to warrant the belief that the people would not bear the taxation requisite to discharge an immense public debt already incur and to pay the necessary expense of the government the cost of two war have be pay not only without a murmur but with unequaled alacrity no one be now leave to doubt that every burden will be cheerfully bear that may be necessary to sustain our civil institution or guard our honor or welfare indeed all experience have show that the willingness of the people to contribute to these end in case of emergency have uniformly outrun the confidence of their representative in the early stage of the new government when all feel the impose influence as they recognize the unequaled service of the first president it be a common sentiment that the great weight of his character could alone bind the discordant material of our government together and save we from the violence of contend faction since his death nearly forty year be go party exasperation have be often carry to its high point the virtue and fortitude of the people have sometimes be greatly try yet our system purify and enhance in value by all it have encounter still preserve its spirit of free and fearless discussion blend with unimpaired fraternal feeling the capacity of the people for self government and their willingness from a high sense of duty and without those exhibition of coercive power so generally employ in other country to submit to all needful restraint and exaction of municipal law have also be favorably exemplified in the history of the american states occasionally it be true the ardor of public sentiment outrun the regular progress of the judicial tribunal or seek to reach case not denounce as criminal by the exist law have display itself in a manner calculate to give pain to the friend of free government and to encourage the hope of those who wish for its overthrow these occurrence however have be far less frequent in our country than in any other of equal population on the globe and with the diffusion of intelligence it may well be hope that they will constantly diminish in frequency and violence the generous patriotism and sound common sense of the great mass of our fellow citizen will assuredly in time produce this result for as every assumption of illegal power not only wound the majesty of the law but furnish a pretext for abridge the liberty of the people the latter have the most direct and permanent interest in preserve the landmark of social order and maintain on all occasion the inviolability of those constitutional and legal provision which they themselves have make in a suppose unfitness of our institution for those hostile emergency which no country can always avoid their friend find a fruitful source of apprehension their enemy of hope while they foresaw less promptness of action than in government differently form they overlook the far more important consideration that with us war could never be the result of individual or irresponsible will but must be a measure of redress for injury sustain voluntarily resort to by those who be to bear the necessary sacrifice who would consequently feel an individual interest in the contest and whose energy would be commensurate with the difficulty to be encounter actual event have prove their error the last war far from impairing give new confidence to our government and amid recent apprehension of a similar conflict we see that the energy of our country would not be want in ample season to vindicate its right we may not possess as we should not desire to possess the extended and ever ready military organization of other nation we may occasionally suffer in the outset for the want of it but among ourselves all doubt upon this great point have cease while a salutary experience will prevent a contrary opinion from invite aggression from abroad certain danger be foretell from the extension of our territory the multiplication of states and the increase of population our system be suppose to be adapt only to boundary comparatively narrow these have be widen beyond conjecture the member of our confederacy be already double and the number of our people be incredibly augmented the alleged cause of danger have long surpass anticipation but none of the consequence have follow the power and influence of the republic have arise to a height obvious to all mankind respect for its authority be not more apparent at its ancient than it be at its present limit new and inexhaustible source of general prosperity have be open the effect of distance have be avert by the inventive genius of our people develop and foster by the spirit of our institution and the enlarged variety and amount of interest production and pursuit have strengthen the chain of mutual dependence and form a circle of mutual benefit too apparent ever to be overlook in justly balance the power of the federal and state authority difficulty nearly insurmountable arise at the outset and subsequent collision be deem inevitable amid these it be scarcely believe possible that a scheme of government so complex in construction could remain uninjured from time to time embarrassment have certainly occur but how just be the confidence of future safety impart by the knowledge that each in succession have be happily remove overlook partial and temporary evil as inseparable from the practical operation of all human institution and look only to the general result every patriot have reason to be satisfied while the federal government have successfully perform its appropriate function in relation to foreign affair and concern evidently national that of every state have remarkably improve in protect and develop local interest and individual welfare and if the vibration of authority have occasionally tend too much toward one or the other it be unquestionably certain that the ultimate operation of the entire system have be to strengthen all the exist institution and to elevate our whole country in prosperity and renown the last perhaps the great of the prominent source of discord and disaster suppose to lurk in our political condition be the institution of domestic slavery our forefather be deeply impressed with the delicacy of this subject and they treat it with a forbearance so evidently wise that in spite of every sinister forebode it never until the present period disturb the tranquillity of our common country such a result be sufficient evidence of the justice and the patriotism of their course it be evidence not to be mistake that an adherence to it can prevent all embarrassment from this as well as from every other anticipate cause of difficulty or danger have not recent event make it obvious to the slight reflection that the least deviation from this spirit of forbearance be injurious to every interest that of humanity include amidst the violence of excited passion this generous and fraternal feeling have be sometimes disregard and stand as i now do before my countryman in this high place of honor and of trust i can not refrain from anxiously invoke my fellow citizen never to be deaf to its dictate perceive before my election the deep interest this subject be begin to excite i believe it a solemn duty fully to make known my sentiment in regard to it and now when every motive for misrepresentation have pass away i trust that they will be candidly weigh and understand at least they will be my standard of conduct in the path before i i then declare that if the desire of those of my countryman who be favorable to my election be gratify i must go into the presidential chair the inflexible and uncompromise opponent of every attempt on the part of congress to abolish slavery in the district of columbia against the wish of the slaveholde states and also with a determination equally decide to resist the slight interference with it in the states where it exist i submit also to my fellow citizen with fullness and frankness the reason which lead i to this determination the result authorize i to believe that they have be approve and be confide in by a majority of the people of the united states include those whom they most immediately affect it now only remain to add that no bill conflict with these view can ever receive my constitutional sanction these opinion have be adopt in the firm belief that they be in accordance with the spirit that actuate the venerate father of the republic and that succeed experience have prove they to be humane patriotic expedient honorable and just if the agitation of this subject be intend to reach the stability of our institution enough have occur to show that it have signally fail and that in this as in every other instance the apprehension of the timid and the hope of the wicked for the destruction of our government be again destine to be disappoint here and there indeed scene of dangerous excitement have occur terrifying instance of local violence have be witness and a reckless disregard of the consequence of their conduct have expose individual to popular indignation but neither masse of the people nor section of the country have be swerve from their devotion to the bond of union and the principle it have make sacred it will be ever thus such attempt at dangerous agitation may periodically return but with each the object will be well understand that predominate affection for our political system which prevail throughout our territorial limit that calm and enlighten judgment which ultimately govern our people as one vast body will always be at hand to resist and control every effort foreign or domestic which aim or would lead to overthrow our institution what can be more gratifying than such a retrospect as this we look back on obstacle avoid and danger overcome on expectation more than realize and prosperity perfectly secure to the hope of the hostile the fear of the timid and the doubt of the anxious actual experience have give the conclusive reply we have see time gradually dispel every unfavorable foreboding and our constitution surmount every adverse circumstance dread at the outset as beyond control present excitement will at all time magnify present danger but true philosophy must teach we that none more threatening than the past can remain to be overcome and we ought for we have just reason to entertain an abide confidence in the stability of our institution and an entire conviction that if administer in the true form character and spirit in which they be establish they be abundantly adequate to preserve to we and our child the rich blessing already derive from they to make our beloved land for a thousand generation that choose spot where happiness spring from a perfect equality of political right for myself therefore i desire to declare that the principle that will govern i in the high duty to which my country call i be a strict adherence to the letter and spirit of the constitution as it be design by those who frame it look back to it as a sacred instrument carefully and not easily frame remember that it be throughout a work of concession and compromise view it as limit to national object regard it as leave to the people and the states all power not explicitly part with i shall endeavor to preserve protect and defend it by anxiously refer to its provision for direction in every action to matter of domestic concernment which it have intrust to the federal government and to such as relate to our intercourse with foreign nation i shall zealously devote myself beyond those limit i shall never pass to enter on this occasion into a further or more minute exposition of my view on the various question of domestic policy would be as obtrusive as it be probably unexpected before the suffrage of my countryman be confer upon i i submit to they with great precision my opinion on all the most prominent of these subject those opinion i shall endeavor to carry out with my utmost ability our course of foreign policy have be so uniform and intelligible as to constitute a rule of executive conduct which leave little to my discretion unless indeed i be willing to run counter to the light of experience and the known opinion of my constituent we sedulously cultivate the friendship of all nation as the condition most compatible with our welfare and the principle of our government we decline alliance as adverse to our peace we desire commercial relation on equal term be ever willing to give a fair equivalent for advantage receive we endeavor to conduct our intercourse with openness and sincerity promptly avow our object and seek to establish that mutual frankness which be as beneficial in the dealing of nation as of man we have no disposition and we disclaim all right to meddle in dispute whether internal or foreign that may molest other country regard they in their actual state as social community and preserve a strict neutrality in all their controversy well know the try valor of our people and our exhaustless resource we neither anticipate nor fear any design aggression and in the consciousness of our own just conduct we feel a security that we shall never be call upon to exert our determination never to permit an invasion of our right without punishment or redress in approach then in the presence of my assemble countryman to make the solemn promise that yet remain and to pledge myself that i will faithfully execute the office i be about to fill i bring with i a settle purpose to maintain the institution of my country which i trust will atone for the error i commit in receive from the people the sacred trust twice confide to my illustrious predecessor and which he have discharge so faithfully and so well i know that i can not expect to perform the arduous task with equal ability and success but unite as i have be in his counsel a daily witness of his exclusive and unsurpassed devotion to his country 's welfare agree with he in sentiment which his countryman have warmly support and permit to partake largely of his confidence i may hope that somewhat of the same cheer approbation will be find to attend upon my path for he i but express with my own the wish of all that he may yet long live to enjoy the brilliant evening of his well spend life and for myself conscious of but one desire faithfully to serve my country i throw myself without fear on its justice and its kindness beyond that i only look to the gracious protection of the divine being whose strengthen support i humbly solicit and whom i fervently pray to look down upon we all may it be among the dispensation of his providence to bless our beloved country with honor and with length

 we have now live almost fifty year under the constitution frame by the sage and patriot of the revolution the conflict in which the nation of europe be engage during a great part of this period the spirit in which they wage war against each other and our intimate commercial connection with every part of the civilized world render it a time of much difficulty for the government of the united states we have have our season of peace and of war with all the evil which precede or follow a state of hostility with powerful nation we encounter these trial with our constitution yet in its infancy and under the disadvantage which a new and untried government must always feel when it be call upon to put forth its whole strength without the light of experience to guide it or the weight of precedent to justify its measure but we have pass triumphantly through all these difficulty our constitution be no long a doubtful experiment and at the end of nearly half a century we find that it have preserve unimpaire the liberty of the people secure the right of property and that our country have improve and be flourish beyond any former example in the history of nation
 in our domestic concern there be everything to encourage we and if you be true to yourself nothing can impede your march to the high point of national prosperity the state which have so long be retard in their improvement by the indian tribe reside in the midst of they be at length relieve from the evil and this unhappy race the original dweller in our land be now place in a situation where we may well hope that they will share in the blessing of civilization and be save from that degradation and destruction to which they be rapidly hasten while they remain in the states and while the safety and comfort of our own citizen have be greatly promote by their removal the philanthropist will rejoice that the remnant of that ill fate race have be at length place beyond the reach of injury or oppression and that the paternal care of the general government will hereafter watch over they and protect they
 if we turn to our relation with foreign power we find our condition equally gratifying actuate by the sincere desire to do justice to every nation and to preserve the blessing of peace our intercourse with they have be conduct on the part of this government in the spirit of frankness and i take pleasure in say that it have generally be meet in a corresponding temper difficulty of old standing have be surmount by friendly discussion and the mutual desire to be just and the claim of our citizen which have be long withhold have at length been acknowledge and adjusted and satisfactory arrangement make for their final payment and with a limited and i trust a temporary exception our relation with every foreign power be now of the most friendly character our commerce continually expand and our flag respect in every quarter of the world
 these cheer and grateful prospect and these multiply favor we owe under providence to the adoption of the federal constitution it be no long a question whether this great country can remain happily united and flourish under our present form of government experience the unerring test of all human undertaking have show the wisdom and foresight of those who form it and have prove that in the union of these states there be a sure foundation for the bright hope of freedom and for the happiness of the people at every hazard and by every sacrifice this union must be preserve
 the necessity of watch with jealous anxiety for the preservation of the union be earnestly press upon his fellow citizen by the father of his country in his farewell address he have there tell we that while experience shall not have demonstrate its impracticability there will always be reason to distrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to weaken its band and he have caution we in the strong term against the formation of party on geographical discrimination as one of the mean which might disturb our union and to which design man would be likely to resort
 the lesson contain in this invaluable legacy of washington to his countryman should be cherish in the heart of every citizen to the late generation and perhaps at no period of time could they be more usefully remember than at the present moment for when we look upon the scene that be pass around we and dwell upon the page of his parting address his paternal counsel would seem to be not merely the offspring of wisdom and foresight but the voice of prophecy foretell event and warn we of the evil to come forty year have pass since this imperishable document be give to his countryman the federal constitution be then regard by he as an experiment and he so speak of it in his address but an experiment upon the success of which the good hope of his country depend and we all know that he be prepared to lay down his life if necessary to secure to it a full and a fair trial the trial have be make it have succeed beyond the proud hope of those who frame it every quarter of this widely extend nation have feel its blessing and share in the general prosperity produce by its adoption but amid this general prosperity and splendid success the danger of which he warn we be become every day more evident and the sign of evil be sufficiently apparent to awaken the deep anxiety in the bosom of the patriot we behold systematic effort publicly make to sow the seed of discord between different part of the united states and to place party division directly upon geographical distinction to excite the south against the north and the north against the south and to force into the controversy the most delicate and exciting topic topic upon which it be impossible that a large portion of the union can ever speak without strong emotion appeal too be constantly make to sectional interest in order to influence the election of the chief magistrate as if it be desire that he should favor a particular quarter of the country instead of fulfil the duty of his station with impartial justice to all and the possible dissolution of the union have at length become an ordinary and familiar subject of discussion have the warn voice of washington been forget or have design already be form to sever the union let it not be suppose that i impute to all of those who have take an active part in these unwise and unprofitable discussion a want of patriotism or of public virtue the honorable feeling of state pride and local attachment find a place in the bosom of the most enlightened and pure but while such man be conscious of their own integrity and honesty of purpose they ought never to forget that the citizen of other states be their political brother and that however mistaken they may be in their view the great body of they be equally honest and upright with themselves mutual suspicion and reproach may in time create mutual hostility and artful and design man will always be find who be ready to foment these fatal division and to inflame the natural jealousy of different section of the country the history of the world be full of such example and especially the history of republic
 what have you to gain by division and dissension delude not yourself with the belief that a breach once make may be afterwards repair if the union be once sever the line of separation will grow wide and wide and the controversy which be now debate and settle in the hall of legislation will then be try in field of battle and determine by the sword neither should you deceive yourself with the hope that the first line of separation would be the permanent one and that nothing but harmony and concord would be find in the new association form upon the dissolution of this union local interest would still be find there and unchastened ambition and if the recollection of common danger in which the people of these united states stand side by side against the common foe the memory of victory win by their united valor the prosperity and happiness they have enjoy under the present constitution the proud name they bear as citizen of this great republic if all these recollection and proof of common interest be not strong enough to bind we together as one people what tie will hold unite the new division of empire when these bond have be break and this union dissever the first line of separation would not last for a single generation new fragment would be tear off new leader would spring up and this great and glorious republic would soon be break into a multitude of petty states without commerce without credit jealous of one another arm for mutual aggression load with taxis to pay army and leader seek aid against each other from foreign power insult and trample upon by the nation of europe until harass with conflict and humble and debase in spirit they would be ready to submit to the absolute dominion of any military adventurer and to surrender their liberty for the sake of repose it be impossible to look on the consequence that would inevitably follow the destruction of this government and not feel indignant when we hear cold calculation about the value of the union and have so constantly before we a line of conduct so well calculate to weaken its tie
 there be too much at stake to allow pride or passion to influence your decision never for a moment believe that the great body of the citizen of any state or states can deliberately intend to do wrong they may under the influence of temporary excitement or misguided opinion commit mistake they may be mislead for a time by the suggestion of self interest but in a community so enlightened and patriotic as the people of the united states argument will soon make they sensible of their error and when convinced they will be ready to repair they if they have no high or well motive to govern they they will at least perceive that their own interest require they to be just to other as they hope to receive justice at their hand
 but in order to maintain the union unimpaire it be absolutely necessary that the law pass by the constituted authority should be faithfully execute in every part of the country and that every good citizen should at all time stand ready to put down with the combined force of the nation every attempt at unlawful resistance under whatever pretext it may be make or whatever shape it may assume unconstitutional or oppressive law may no doubt be pass by congress either from erroneous view or the want of due consideration if they be within the reach of judicial authority the remedy be easy and peaceful and if from the character of the law it be an abuse of power not within the control of the judiciary then free discussion and calm appeal to reason and to the justice of the people will not fail to redress the wrong but until the law shall be declare void by the court or repeal by congress no individual or combination of individual can be justify in forcibly resist its execution it be impossible that any government can continue to exist upon any other principle it would cease to be a government and be unworthy of the name if it have not the power to enforce the execution of its own law within its own sphere of action
 it be true that case may be imagine disclose such a settle purpose of usurpation and oppression on the part of the government as would justify an appeal to arm these however be extreme case which we have no reason to apprehend in a government where the power be in the hand of a patriotic people and no citizen who love his country would in any case whatever resort to forcible resistance unless he clearly see that the time have come when a freeman should prefer death to submission for if such a struggle be once begin and the citizen of one section of the country array in arm against those of another in doubtful conflict let the battle result as it may there will be an end of the union and with it an end to the hope of freedom the victory of the injure would not secure to they the blessing of liberty it would avenge their wrong but they would themselves share in the common ruin
 but the constitution can not be maintain nor the union preserve in opposition to public feeling by the mere exertion of the coercive power confide to the general government the foundation must be lay in the affection of the people in the security it give to life liberty character and property in every quarter of the country and in the fraternal attachment which the citizen of the several states bear to one another as member of one political family mutually contribute to promote the happiness of each other hence the citizen of every state should studiously avoid everything calculate to wound the sensibility or offend the just pride of the people of other states and they should frown upon any proceeding within their own border likely to disturb the tranquillity of their political brother in other portion of the union in a country so extensive as the united states and with pursuit so varied the internal regulation of the several states must frequently differ from one another in important particular and this difference be unavoidably increase by the vary principle upon which the american colony be originally plant principle which have take deep root in their social relation before the revolution and therefore of necessity influence their policy since they become free and independent states but each state have the unquestionable right to regulate its own internal concern accord to its own pleasure and while it do not interfere with the right of the people of other states or the right of the union every state must be the sole judge of the measure proper to secure the safety of its citizen and promote their happiness and all effort on the part of people of other states to cast odium upon their institution and all measure calculate to disturb their right of property or to put in jeopardy their peace and internal tranquillity be in direct opposition to the spirit in which the union be form and must endanger its safety motive of philanthropy may be assign for this unwarrantable interference and weak man may persuade themselves for a moment that they be labor in the cause of humanity and assert the right of the human race but everyone upon sober reflection will see that nothing but mischief can come from these improper assault upon the feeling and right of other rest assure that the man find busy in this work of discord be not worthy of your confidence and deserve your strong reprobation
 in the legislation of congress also and in every measure of the general government justice to every portion of the united states should be faithfully observe no free government can stand without virtue in the people and a lofty spirit of patriotism and if the sordid feeling of mere selfishness shall usurp the place which ought to be fill by public spirit the legislation of congress will soon be convert into a scramble for personal and sectional advantage under our free institution the citizen of every quarter of our country be capable of attain a high degree of prosperity and happiness without seek to profit themselves at the expense of other and every such attempt must in the end fail to succeed for the people in every part of the united states be too enlightened not to understand their own right and interest and to detect and defeat every effort to gain undue advantage over they and when such design be discover it naturally provoke resentment which can not always be easily allay justice full and ample justice to every portion of the united states should be the rule principle of every freeman and should guide the deliberation of every public body whether it be state or national
 it be well know that there have always be those amongst we who wish to enlarge the power of the general government and experience would seem to indicate that there be a tendency on the part of this government to overstep the boundary mark out for it by the constitution its legitimate authority be abundantly sufficient for all the purpose for which it be create and its power be expressly enumerate there can be no justification for claim anything beyond they every attempt to exercise power beyond these limit should be promptly and firmly opposed for one evil example will lead to other measure still more mischievous and if the principle of constructive power or suppose advantage or temporary circumstance shall ever be permit to justify the assumption of a power not give by the constitution the general government will before long absorb all the power of legislation and you will have in effect but one consolidated government from the extent of our country its diversified interest different pursuit and different habit it be too obvious for argument that a single consolidated government would be wholly inadequate to watch over and protect its interest and every friend of our free institution should be always prepared to maintain unimpaired and in full vigor the right and sovereignty of the states and to confine the action of the general government strictly to the sphere of its appropriate duty
 there be perhaps no one of the power confer on the federal government so liable to abuse as the tax power the most productive and convenient source of revenue be necessarily give to it that it might be able to perform the important duty impose upon it and the taxis which it lay upon commerce be conceal from the real payer in the price of the article they do not so readily attract the attention of the people as small sum demand from they directly by the taxgatherer but the tax impose on good enhance by so much the price of the commodity to the consumer and as many of these duty be impose on article of necessity which be daily use by the great body of the people the money raise by these impost be draw from their pocket congress have no right under the constitution to take money from the people unless it be require to execute some one of the specific power intrust to the government and if they raise more than be necessary for such purpose it be an abuse of the power of taxation and unjust and oppressive it may indeed happen that the revenue will sometimes exceed the amount anticipate when the taxis be lay when however this be ascertain it be easy to reduce they and in such a case it be unquestionably the duty of the government to reduce they for no circumstance can justify it in assume a power not give to it by the constitution nor in take away the money of the people when it be not need for the legitimate want of the government
 plain as these principle appear to be you will yet find there be a constant effort to induce the general government to go beyond the limit of its tax power and to impose unnecessary burden upon the people many powerful interest be continually at work to procure heavy duty on commerce and to swell the revenue beyond the real necessity of the public service and the country have already feel the injurious effect of their combined influence they succeed in obtain a tariff of duty bear most oppressively on the agricultural and labor class of society and produce a revenue that could not be usefully employ within the range of the power confer upon congress and in order to fasten upon the people this unjust and unequal system of taxation extravagant scheme of internal improvement be get up in various quarter to squander the money and to purchase support thus one unconstitutional measure be intend to be uphold by another and the abuse of the power of taxation be to be maintain by usurp the power of expend the money in internal improvement you can not have forget the severe and doubtful struggle through which we pass when the executive department of the government by its veto endeavor to arrest this prodigal scheme of injustice and to bring back the legislation of congress to the boundary prescribe by the constitution the good sense and practical judgment of the people when the subject be bring before they sustain the course of the executive and this plan of unconstitutional expenditure for the purpose of corrupt influence be i trust finally overthrow
 the result of this decision have be feel in the rapid extinguishment of the public debt and the large accumulation of a surplus in the treasury notwithstanding the tariff be reduce and be now very far below the amount originally contemplate by its advocate but rely upon it the design to collect an extravagant revenue and to burden you with taxis beyond the economical want of the government be not yet abandon the various interest which have combine together to impose a heavy tariff and to produce an overflowing treasury be too strong and have too much at stake to surrender the contest the corporation and wealthy individual who be engage in large manufacturing establishment desire a high tariff to increase their gain design politician will support it to conciliate their favor and to obtain the mean of profuse expenditure for the purpose of purchase influence in other quarter and since the people have decide that the federal government can not be permit to employ its income in internal improvement effort will be make to seduce and mislead the citizen of the several states by hold out to they the deceitful prospect of benefit to be derive from a surplus revenue collect by the general government and annually divide among the states and if encourage by these fallacious hope the states should disregard the principle of economy which ought to characterize every republican government and should indulge in lavish expenditure exceed their resource they will before long find themselves oppress with debt which they be unable to pay and the temptation will become irresistible to support a high tariff in order to obtain a surplus for distribution do not allow yourself my fellow citizen to be mislead on this subject the federal government can not collect a surplus for such purpose without violate the principle of the constitution and assume power which have not be grant it be moreover a system of injustice and if persist in will inevitably lead to corruption and must end in ruin the surplus revenue will be draw from the pocket of the people from the farmer the mechanic and the labor class of society but who will receive it when distribute among the states where it be to be dispose of by lead state politician who have friend to favor and political partisan to gratify it will certainly not be return to those who pay it and who have most need of it and be honestly entitle to it there be but one safe rule and that be to confine the general government rigidly within the sphere of its appropriate duty it have no power to raise a revenue or impose taxis except for the purpose enumerate in the constitution and if its income be find to exceed these want it should be forthwith reduce and the burden of the people so far lightened
 in review the conflict which have take place between different interest in the united states and the policy pursue since the adoption of our present form of government we find nothing that have produce such deep seat evil as the course of legislation in relation to the currency the constitution of the united states unquestionably intend to secure to the people a circulate medium of gold and silver but the establishment of a national bank by congress with the privilege of issue paper money receivable in the payment of the public due and the unfortunate course of legislation in the several states upon the same subject drive from general circulation the constitutional currency and substitute one of paper in its place
 it be not easy for man engage in the ordinary pursuit of business whose attention have not be particularly draw to the subject to foresee all the consequence of a currency exclusively of paper and we ought not on that account to be surprised at the facility with which law be obtain to carry into effect the paper system honest and even enlightened man be sometimes mislead by the specious and plausible statement of the designing but experience have now prove the mischief and danger of a paper currency and it rest with you to determine whether the proper remedy shall be apply
 the paper system be found on public confidence and having of itself no intrinsic value it be liable to great and sudden fluctuation thereby render property insecure and the wage of labor unsteady and uncertain the corporation which create the paper money can not be rely upon to keep the circulate medium uniform in amount in time of prosperity when confidence be high they be tempt by the prospect of gain or by the influence of those who hope to profit by it to extend their issue of paper beyond the bound of discretion and the reasonable demand of business and when these issue have be push on from day to day until public confidence be at length shaken then a reaction take place and they immediately withdraw the credit they have give suddenly curtail their issue and produce an unexpected and ruinous contraction of the circulate medium which be feel by the whole community the bank by this mean save themselves and the mischievous consequence of their imprudence or cupidity be visit upon the public nor do the evil stop here these ebb and flow in the currency and these indiscreet extension of credit naturally engender a spirit of speculation injurious to the habit and character of the people we have already see its effect in the wild spirit of speculation in the public land and various kind of stock which within the last year or two seize upon such a multitude of our citizen and threaten to pervade all class of society and to withdraw their attention from the sober pursuit of honest industry it be not by encourage this spirit that we shall well preserve public virtue and promote the true interest of our country but if your currency continue as exclusively paper as it now be it will foster this eager desire to amass wealth without labor it will multiply the number of dependent on bank accommodation and bank favor the temptation to obtain money at any sacrifice will become strong and strong and inevitably lead to corruption which will find its way into your public council and destroy at no distant day the purity of your government some of the evil which arise from this system of paper press with peculiar hardship upon the class of society least able to bear it a portion of this currency frequently becamedepreciate or worthless and all of it be easily counterfeit in such a manner as to require peculiar skill and much experience to distinguish the counterfeit from the genuine note these fraud be most generally perpetrate in the small note which be use in the daily transaction of ordinary business and the loss occasion by they be commonly throw upon the labor class of society whose situation and pursuit put it out of their power to guard themselves from these imposition and whose daily wage be necessary for their subsistence it be the duty of every government so to regulate its currency as to protect this numerous class as far as practicable from the imposition of avarice and fraud it be more especially the duty of the united states where the government be emphatically the government of the people and where this respectable portion of our citizen be so proudly distinguish from the labor class of all other nation by their independent spirit their love of liberty their intelligence and their high tone of moral character their industry in peace be the source of our wealth and their bravery in war have cover we with glory and the government of the united states will but ill discharge its duty if it leave they a prey to such dishonest imposition yet it be evident that their interest can not be effectually protect unless silver and gold be restore to circulation
 these view alone of the paper currency be sufficient to call for immediate reform but there be another consideration which should still more strongly press it upon your attention
 recent event have prove that the paper money system of this country may be use as an engine to undermine your free institution and that those who desire to engross all power in the hand of the few and to govern by corruption or force be aware of its power and prepare to employ it your bank now furnish your only circulate medium and money be plenty or scarce accord to the quantity of note issue by they while they have capital not greatly disproportione to each other they be competitor in business and no one of they can exercise dominion over the rest and although in the present state of the currency these bank may and do operate injuriously upon the habit of business the pecuniary concern and the moral tone of society yet from their number and dispersed situation they can not combine for the purpose of political influence and whatever may be the disposition of some of they their power of mischief must necessarily be confine to a narrow space and feel only in their immediate neighborhood
 but when the charter for the bank of the united states be obtain from congress it perfect the scheme of the paper system and give to its advocate the position they have struggle to obtain from the commencement of the federal government to the present hour the immense capital and peculiar privilege bestow upon it enable it to exercise despotic sway over the other bank in every part of the country from its superior strength it could seriously injure if not destroy the business of any one of they which might incur its resentment and it openly claim for itself the power of regulate the currency throughout the united states in other word it assert and it undoubtedly possess the power to make money plenty or scarce at its pleasure at any time and in any quarter of the union by control the issue of other bank and permit an expansion or compel a general contraction of the circulate medium accord to its own will the other banking institution be sensible of its strength and they soon generally become its obedient instrument ready at all time to execute its mandate and with the bank necessarily go also that numerous class of person in our commercial city who depend altogether on bank credit for their solvency and mean of business and who be therefore oblige for their own safety to propitiate the favor of the money power by distinguished zeal and devotion in its service the result of the ill advise legislation which establish this great monopoly be to concentrate the whole moneyed power of the union with its boundless mean of corruption and its numerous dependent under the direction and command of one acknowledge head thus organize this particular interest as one body and securing to it unity and concert of action throughout the united states and enable it to bring forward upon any occasion its entire and undivided strength to support or defeat any measure of the government in the hand of this formidable power thus perfectly organize be also place unlimited dominion over the amount of the circulate medium give it the power to regulate the value of property and the fruit of labor in every quarter of the union and to bestow prosperity or bring ruin upon any city or section of the country as might well comport with its own interest or policy
 we be not leave to conjecture how the moneyed power thus organize and with such a weapon in its hand would be likely to use it the distress and alarm which pervade and agitate the whole country when the bank of the united states wage war upon the people in order to compel they to submit to its demand can not yet be forget the ruthless and unspare temper with which whole city and community be oppress individual impoverish and ruin and a scene of cheerful prosperity suddenly change into one of gloom and despondency ought to be indelibly impressed on the memory of the people of the united states if such be its power in a time of peace what would it not have be in a season of war with an enemy at your door no nation but the freeman of the united states could have come out victorious from such a contest yet if you have not conquer the government would have pass from the hand of the many to the hand of the few and this organize money power from its secret conclave would have dictate the choice of your high officer and compel you to make peace or war as well suit their own wish the form of your government might for a time have remain but its live spirit would have depart from it
 the distress and suffering inflict on the people by the bank be some of the fruit of that system of policy which be continually strive to enlarge the authority of the federal government beyond the limit fix by the constitution the power enumerate in that instrument do not confer on congress the right to establish such a corporation as the bank of the united states and the evil consequence which follow may warn we of the danger of depart from the true rule of construction and of permit temporary circumstance or the hope of well promote the public welfare to influence in any degree our decision upon the extent of the authority of the general government let we abide by the constitution as it be write or amend it in the constitutional mode if it be find to be defective
 the severe lesson of experience will i doubt not be sufficient to prevent congress from again charter such a monopoly even if the constitution do not present an insuperable objection to it but you must remember my fellow citizen that eternal vigilance by the people be the price of liberty and that you must pay the price if you wish to secure the blessing it behoove you therefore to be watchful in your states as well as in the federal government the power which the moneyed interest can exercise when concentrate under a single head and with our present system of currency be sufficiently demonstrate in the struggle make by the bank of the united states defeat in the general government tho same class of intriguer and politician will now resort to the states and endeavor to obtain there the same organization which they fail to perpetuate in the union and with specious and deceitful plan of public advantage and state interest and state pride they will endeavor to establish in the different states one moneyed institution with overgrown capital and exclusive privilege sufficient to enable it to control the operation of the other bank such an institution will be pregnant with the same evil produce by the bank of the united states although its sphere of action be more confined and in the state in which it be charter the money power will be able to embody its whole strength and to move together with undivided force to accomplish any object it may wish to attain you have already have abundant evidence of its power to inflict injury upon the agricultural mechanical and labor class of society and over those whose engagement in trade or speculation render they dependent on bank facility the dominion of the state monopoly will be absolute and their obedience unlimited with such a bank and a paper currency the money power would in a few year govern the state and control its measure and if a sufficient number of states can be induce to create such establishment the time will soon come when it will again take the field against the united states and succeed in perfect and perpetuate its organization by a charter from congress
 it be one of the serious evil of our present system of banking that it enable one class of society and that by no mean a numerous one by its control over the currency to act injuriously upon the interest of all the other and to exercise more than its just proportion of influence in political affair the agricultural the mechanical and the labor class have little or no share in the direction of the great moneyed corporation and from their habit and the nature of their pursuit they be incapable of form extensive combination to act together with united force such concert of action may sometimes be produce in a single city or in a small district of country by mean of personal communication with each other but they have no regular or active correspondence with those who be engage in similar pursuit in distant place they have but little patronage to give to the press and exercise but a small share of influence over it they have no crowd of dependent about they who hope to grow rich without labor by their countenance and favor and who be therefore always ready to execute their wish the planter the farmer the mechanic and the laborer all know that their success depend upon their own industry and economy and that they must not expect to become suddenly rich by the fruit of their toil yet these class of society form the great body of the people of the united states they be the bone and sinew of the country man who love liberty and desire nothing but equal right and equal law and who moreover hold the great mass of our national wealth although it be distribute in moderate amount among the million of freeman who possess it but with overwhelming number and wealth on their side they be in constant danger of lose their fair influence in the government and with difficulty maintain their just right against the incessant effort daily make to encroach upon they the mischief spring from the power which the moneyed interest derive from a paper currency which they be able to control from the multitude of corporation with exclusive privilege which they have succeed in obtain in the different states and which be employ altogether for their benefit and unless you become more watchful in your state and check this spirit of monopoly and thirst for exclusive privilege you will in the end find that the most important power of government have be give or barter away and the control over your dear interest have pass into the hand of these corporation
 the paper money system and its natural association monopoly and exclusive privilege have already strike their root too deep in the soil and it will require all your effort to check its further growth and to eradicate the evil the man who profit by the abuse and desire to perpetuate they will continue to besiege the hall of legislation in the general government as well as in the states and will seek by every artifice to mislead and deceive the public servant it be to yourselves that you must look for safety and the mean of guard and perpetuate your free institution in your hand be rightfully place the sovereignty of the country and to you everyone place in authority be ultimately responsible it be always in your power to see that the wish of the people be carry into faithful execution and their will when once make know must soon or later be obey and while the people remain as i trust they ever will uncorrupted and incorruptible and continue watchful and jealous of their right the government be safe and the cause of freedom will continue to triumph over all its enemy
 but it will require steady and persevere exertion on your part to rid yourself of the iniquity and mischief of the paper system and to check the spirit of monopoly and other abuse which have spring up with it and of which it be the main support so many interest be unite to resist all reform on this subject that you must not hope the conflict will be a short one nor success easy my humble effort have not be spare during my administration of the government to restore the constitutional currency of gold and silver and something i trust have be do toward the accomplishment of this most desirable object but enough yet remain to require all your energy and perseverance the power however be in your hand and the remedy must and will be apply if you determine upon it
 while i be thus endeavor to press upon your attention the principle which i deem of vital importance in the domestic concern of the country i ought not to pass over without notice the important consideration which should govern your policy toward foreign power it be unquestionably our true interest to cultivate the most friendly understanding with every nation and to avoid by every honorable mean the calamity of war and we shall well attain this object by frankness and sincerity in our foreign intercourse by the prompt and faithful execution of treaty and by justice and impartiality in our conduct to all but no nation however desirous of peace can hope to escape occasional collision with other power and the sound dictate of policy require that we should place ourselves in a condition to assert our right if a resort to force should ever become necessary our local situation our long line of seacoast indent by numerous bay with deep river open into the interior as well as our extended and still increase commerce point to the navy as our natural mean of defense it will in the end be find to be the cheap and most effectual and now be the time in a season of peace and with an overflowing revenue that we can year after year add to its strength without increase the burden of the people it be your true policy for your navy will not only protect your rich and flourish commerce in distant sea but will enable you to reach and annoy the enemy and will give to defense its great efficiency by meet danger at a distance from home it be impossible by any line of fortification to guard every point from attack against a hostile force advance from the ocean and select its object but they be indispensable to protect city from bombardment dockyard and naval arsenal from destruction to give shelter to merchant vessel in time of war and to single ship or weak squadron when press by superior force fortification of this description can not be too soon complete and armed and place in a condition of the most perfect preparation the abundant mean we now possess can not be apply in any manner more useful to the country and when this be do and our naval force sufficiently strengthen and our militia arm we need not fear that any nation will wantonly insult we or needlessly provoke hostility we shall more certainly preserve peace when it be well understand that we be prepare for war

fellow citizen of the senate and house of representatives

 the act of the 23d of june 1836 regulate the deposit of the public money and direct the employment of state district and territorial bank for that purpose make it the duty of the secretary of the treasury to discontinue the use of such of they as should at any time refuse to redeem their note in specie and to substitute other bank provide a sufficient number could be obtain to receive the public deposit upon the term and condition therein prescribe the general and almost simultaneous suspension of specie payment by the bank in may last render the performance of this duty imperative in respect to those which have be select under the act and make it at the same time impracticable to employ the requisite number of other upon the prescribe condition the specific regulation establish by congress for the deposit and safe keeping of the public money having thus unexpectedly become inoperative i feel it to be my duty to afford you an early opportunity for the exercise of your supervisory power over the subject

 i be also lead to apprehend that the suspension of specie payment increase the embarrassment before exist in the pecuniary affair of the country would so far diminish the public revenue that the accrue receipt into the treasury would not with the reserved five million be sufficient to defray the unavoidable expense of the government until the usual period for the meeting of congress whilst the authority to call upon the states for a portion of the sum deposit with they be too restrict to enable the department to realize a sufficient amount from that source these apprehension have be justify by subsequent result which render it certain that this deficiency will occur if additional mean be not provide by congress

 the difficulty experience by the mercantile interest in meet their engagement induce they to apply to i previously to the actual suspension of specie payment for indulgence upon their bond for duty and all the relief authorize by law be promptly and cheerfully grant the dependence of the treasury upon the avail of these bond to enable it to make the deposit with the states require by law lead i in the outset to limit this indulgence to the 1st of september but it have since be extend to the 1st of october that the matter might be submit to your further direction

 question be also expect to arise in the recess in respect to the october installment of those deposit require the interposition of congress

 a provision of another act pass about the same time and intend to secure a faithful compliance with the obligation of the united states to satisfy all demand upon they in specie or its equivalent prohibit the offer of any bank note not convertible on the spot into gold or silver at the will of the holder and the ability of the government with million on deposit to meet its engagement in the manner thus require by law be render very doubtful by the event to which i have refer

 sensible that adequate provision for these unexpected exigency could only be make by congress convince that some of they would be indispensably necessary to the public service before the regular period of your meeting and desirous also to enable you to exercise at the early moment your full constitutional power for the relief of the country i could not with propriety avoid subject you to the inconvenience of assemble at as early a day as the state of the popular representation would permit i be sure that i have do but justice to your feeling in believe that this inconvenience will be cheerfully encounter in the hope of render your meeting conducive to the good of the country

 during the early stage of the revulsion through which we have just pass much acrimonious discussion arise and great diversity of opinion exist as to its real cause this be not surprising the operation of credit be so diversified and the influence which affect they so numerous and often so subtle that even impartial and well inform person be seldom find to agree in respect to they to inherent difficulty be also add other tendency which be by no mean favorable to the discovery of truth it be hardly to be expect that those who disapprove the policy of the government in relation to the currency would in the excited state of public feeling produce by the occasion fail to attribute to that policy any extensive embarrassment in the monetary affair of the country the matter thus became connect with the passion and conflict of party opinion be more or less affect by political consideration and difference be prolong which might otherwise have be determine by an appeal to fact by the exercise of reason or by mutual concession it be however a cheer reflection that circumstance of this nature can not prevent a community so intelligent as our from ultimately arrive at correct conclusion encourage by the firm belief of this truth i proceed to state my view so far as may be necessary to a clear understanding of the remedy i feel it my duty to propose and of the reason by which i have be lead to recommend they

 the history of trade in the united states for the last three or four year afford the most convincing evidence that our present condition be chiefly to be attribute to overaction in all the department of business an over action deriving perhaps its first impulse from antecedent cause but stimulate to its destructive consequence by excessive issue of bank paper and by other facility for the acquisition and enlargement of credit at the commencement of the year 1834 the banking capital of the united states include that of the national bank then exist amount to about $ 200,000,000 the bank note then in circulation to about ninety five million and the loan and discount of the bank to three hundred and twenty four million between that time and the 1st of january 1836 be the late period to which accurate account have be receive our banking capital be increase to more than two hundred and fifty one million our paper circulation to more than one hundred and forty million and the loan and discount to more than four hundred and fifty seven million to this vast increase be to be add the many million of credit acquire by mean of foreign loan contract by the states and state institution and above all by the lavish accommodation extend by foreign dealer to our merchant

 the consequence of this redundancy of credit and of the spirit of reckless speculation engender by it be a foreign debt contract by our citizen estimate in march last at more than $ 30,000,000 the extension to trader in the interior of our country of credit for supply greatly beyond the want of the people the investment of $ 39,500,000 in unproductive public land in the year 1835 and 1836 whilst in the precede year the sale amount to only four and a half million the creation of debt to an almost countless amount for real estate in exist or anticipated city and village equally unproductive and at price now see to have be greatly disproportionate to their real value the expenditure of immense sum in improvement which in many case have be find to be ruinously improvident the diversion to other pursuit of much of the labor that should have be apply to agriculture thereby contribute to the expenditure of large sum in the importation of grain from europe an expenditure which amount in 1834 to about $ 250,000 be in the first two quarter of the present year increase to more than $ 2,000,000 and finally without enumerate other injurious result the rapid growth among all class and especially in our great commercial town of luxurious habit found too often on merely fancied wealth and detrimental alike to the industry the resource and the moral of our people

 it be so impossible that such a state of thing could long continue that the prospect of revulsion be present to the mind of considerate man before it actually come none however have correctly anticipate its severity a concurrence of circumstance inadequate of themselves to produce such widespread and calamitous embarrassment tend so greatly to aggravate they that they can not be overlook in consider their history among these may be mention as most prominent the great loss of capital sustain by our commercial emporium in the fire of december 1835 -a loss the effect of which be underrate at the time because postpone for a season by the great facility of credit then exist the disturbing effect in our commercial city of the transfer of the public money require by the deposit law of june 1836 and the measure adopt by the foreign creditor of our merchant to reduce their debt and to withdraw from the united states a large portion of our specie

 however unwilling any of our citizen may heretofore have be to assign to these cause the chief instrumentality in produce the present state of thing the development subsequently make and the actual condition of other commercial country must as it seem to i dispel all remain doubt upon the subject it have since appear that evil similar to those suffer by ourselves have be experience in great britain on the continent and indeed throughout the commercial world and that in other country as well as in our own they have be uniformly precede by an undue enlargement of the boundary of trade prompt as with we by unprecedented expansion of the system of credit a reference to the amount of banking capital and the issue of paper credit put in circulation in great britain by bank and in other way during the year 1834 1835 and 1836 will show an augmentation of the paper currency there as much disproportione to the real want of trade as in the united states with this redundancy of the paper currency there arise in that country also a spirit of adventurous speculation embrace the whole range of human enterprise aid be profusely give to project improvement large investment be make in foreign stock and loan credit for good be grant with unbounded liberality to merchant in foreign country and all the mean of acquire and employ credit be put in active operation and extend in their effect to every department of business and to every quarter of the globe the reaction be proportion in its violence to the extraordinary character of the event which precede it the commercial community of great britain be subject to the great difficulty and their debtor in this country be not only suddenly deprive of accustomed and expect credit but call upon for payment which in the actual posture of thing here could only be make through a general pressure and at the most ruinous sacrifice

 in view of these fact it would seem impossible for sincere inquirer after truth to resist the conviction that the cause of the revulsion in both country have be substantially the same two nation the most commercial in the world enjoy but recently the high degree of apparent prosperity and maintain with each other the close relation be suddenly in a time of profound peace and without any great national disaster arrest in their career and plunge into a state of embarrassment and distress in both country we have witness the same redundancy of paper money and other facility of credit the same spirit of speculation the same partial success the same difficulty and reverse and at length nearly the same overwhelming catastrophe the most material difference between the result in the two country have only be that with we there have also occur an extensive derangement in the fiscal affair of the federal and state government occasion by the suspension of specie payment by the bank

 the history of these cause and effect in great britain and the united states be substantially the history of the revulsion in all other commercial country

 the present and visible effect of these circumstance on the operation of the government and on the industry of the people point out the object which call for your immediate attention

 they be to regulate by law the safe keeping transfer and disbursement of the public money to designate the fund to be receive and pay by the government to enable the treasury to meet promptly every demand upon it to prescribe the term of indulgence and the mode of settlement to be adopt as well in collect from individual the revenue that have accrue as in withdraw it from former depository and to devise and adopt such further measure within the constitutional competency of congress as will be well calculate to revive the enterprise and to promote the prosperity of the country

 for the deposit transfer and disbursement of the revenue national and state bank have always with temporary and limited exception be heretofore employ but although advocate of each system be still to be find it be apparent that the event of the last few month have greatly augment the desire long exist among the people of the united states to separate the fiscal operation of the government from those of individual or corporation

 again to create a national bank as a fiscal agent would be to disregard the popular will twice solemnly and unequivocally express on no question of domestic policy be there strong evidence that the sentiment of a large majority be deliberately fix and i can not concur with those who think they see in recent event a proof that these sentiment be or a reason that they should be change

 event similar in their origin and character have heretofore frequently occur without produce any such change and the lesson of experience must be forget if we suppose that the present overthrow of credit would have be prevent by the existence of a national bank proneness to excessive issue have ever be the vice of the banking system a vice as prominent in national as in state institution this propensity be as subservient to the advancement of private interest in the one as in the other and those who direct they both be principally guide by the same view and influence by the same motive will be equally ready to stimulate extravagance of enterprise by improvidence of credit how strikingly be this conclusion sustain by experience the bank of the united states with the vast power confer on it by congress do not or could not prevent former and similar embarrassment nor have the still great strength it have be say to possess under its present charter enable it in the exist emergency to check other institution or even to save itself in great britain where it have be see the same cause have be attend with the same effect a national bank possess power far great than be ask for by the warm advocate of such an institution here have also prove unable to prevent an undue expansion of credit and the evil that flow from it nor can i find any tenable ground for the reestablishment of a national bank in the derangement allege at present to exist in the domestic exchange of the country or in the facility it may be capable of afford they although advantage of this sort be anticipate when the first bank of the united states be create they be regard as an incidental accommodation not one which the federal government be bind or could be call upon to furnish this accommodation be now indeed after the lapse of not many year demand from it as among its first duty and an omission to aid and regulate commercial exchange be treat as a ground of loud and serious complaint such result only serve to exemplify the constant desire among some of our citizen to enlarge the power of the government and extend its control to subject with which it should not interfere they can never justify the creation of an institution to promote such object on the contrary they justly excite among the community a more diligent inquiry into the character of those operation of trade toward which it be desire to extend such peculiar favor

 the various transaction which bear the name of domestic exchange differ essentially in their nature operation and utility one class of they consist of bill of exchange draw for the purpose of transfer actual capital from one part of the country to another or to anticipate the proceed of property actually transmit bill of this description be highly useful in the movement of trade and well deserve all the encouragement which can rightfully be give to they another class be make up of bill of exchange not draw to transfer actual capital nor on the credit of property transmit but to create fictitious capital partake at once of the character of note discount in bank and of bank note in circulation and swell the mass of paper credit to a vast extent in the most objectionable manner these bill have form for the last few year a large proportion of what be term the domestic exchange of the country serve as the mean of usurious profit and constitute the most unsafe and precarious paper in circulation this specie of traffic instead of be uphold ought to be discountenance by the government and the people

 in transfer its fund from place to place the government be on the same footing with the private citizen and may resort to the same legal mean it may do so through the medium of bill draw by itself or purchase from other and in these operation it may in a manner undoubtedly constitutional and legitimate facilitate and assist exchange of individual found on real transaction of trade the extent to which this may be do and the good mean of effecting it be entitle to the full consideration this have be bestow by the secretary of the treasury and his view will be submit to you in his report

 but it be not design by the constitution that the government should assume the management of domestic or foreign exchange it be indeed authorize to regulate by law the commerce between the states and to provide a general standard of value or medium of exchange in gold and silver but it be not its province to aid individual in the transfer of their fund otherwise than through the facility afford by the post office department as justly might it be call on to provide for the transportation of their merchandise these be operation of trade they ought to be conduct by those who be interested in they in the same manner that the incidental difficulty of other pursuit be encounter by other class of citizen such aid have not be deem necessary in other country throughout europe the domestic as well as the foreign exchange be carry on by private house often if not generally without the assistance of bank yet they extend throughout distinct sovereignty and far exceed in amount the real exchange of the united states there be no reason why our own may not be conduct in the same manner with equal cheapness and safety certainly this might be accomplish if it be favor by those most deeply interested and few can doubt that their own interest as well as the general welfare of the country would be promote by leave such a subject in the hand of those to whom it properly belong a system found on private interest enterprise and competition without the aid of legislative grant or regulation by law would rapidly prosper it would be free from the influence of political agitation and extend the same exemption to trade itself and it would put an end to those complaint of neglect partiality injustice and oppression which be the unavoidable result of interference by the government in the proper concern of individual all former attempt on the part of the government to carry its legislation in this respect far than be design by the constitution have in the end prove injurious and have serve only to convince the great body of the people more and more of the certain danger of blend private interest with the operation of public business and there be no reason to suppose that a repetition of they now would be more successful

 it can not be conceal that there exist in our community opinion and feeling on this subject in direct opposition to each other a large portion of they combine great intelligence activity and influence be no doubt sincere in their belief that the operation of trade ought to be assist by such a connection they regard a national bank as necessary for this purpose and they be disinclined to every measure that do not tend soon or later to the establishment of such an institution on the other hand a majority of the people be believe to be irreconcilably oppose to that measure they consider such a concentration of power dangerous to their liberty and many of they regard it as a violation of the constitution this collision of opinion have doubtless cause much of the embarrassment to which the commercial transaction of the country have lately be expose banking have become a political topic of the high interest and trade have suffer in the conflict of party a speedy termination of this state of thing however desirable be scarcely to be expect we have see for nearly half a century that those who advocate a national bank by whatever motive they may be influence constitute a portion of our community too numerous to allow we to hope for an early abandonment of their favorite plan on the other hand they must indeed form an erroneous estimate of the intelligence and temper of the american people who suppose that they have continue on slight or insufficient ground their persevere opposition to such an institution or that they can be induce by pecuniary pressure or by any other combination of circumstance to surrender principle they have so long and so inflexibly maintain

 my own view of the subject be unchanged they have be repeatedly and unreservedly announce to my fellow citizen who with full knowledge of they confer upon i the two high office of the government on the last of these occasion i feel it due to the people to apprise they distinctly that in the event of my election i would not be able to cooperate in the reestablishment of a national bank to these sentiment i have now only to add the expression of an increase conviction that the reestablishment of such a bank in any form whilst it would not accomplish the beneficial purpose promise by its advocate would impair the rightful supremacy of the popular will injure the character and diminish the influence of our political system and bring once more into existence a concentrate moneyed power hostile to the spirit and threaten the permanency of our republican institution

 local bank have be employ for the deposit and distribution of the revenue at all time partially and on three different occasion exclusively first anterior to the establishment of the first bank of the united states secondly in the interval between the termination of that institution and the charter of its successor and thirdly during the limited period which have now so abruptly close the connection thus repeatedly attempt prove unsatisfactory on each successive occasion notwithstanding the various measure which be adopt to facilitate or insure its success on the last occasion in the year 1833 the employment of the state bank be guard especially in every way which experience and caution could suggest personal security be require for the safe keeping and prompt payment of the money to be receive and full return of their condition be from time to time to be make by the depository in the first stage the measure be eminently successful notwithstanding the violent opposition of the bank of the united states and the unceasing effort make to overthrow it the select bank perform with fidelity and without any embarrassment to themselves or to the community their engagement to the government and the system promise to be permanently useful but when it become necessary under the act of june 1836 to withdraw from they the public money for the purpose of place it in additional institution or of transfer it to the states they find it in many case inconvenient to comply with the demand of the treasury and numerous and pressing application be make for indulgence or relief as the installment under the deposit law become payable their own embarrassment and the necessity under which they lay of curtail their discount and call in their debt increase the general distress and contribute with other cause to hasten the revulsion in which at length they in common with the other bank be fatally involve

 under these circumstance it become our solemn duty to inquire whether there be not in any connection between the government and bank of issue evil of great magnitude inherent in its very nature and against which no precaution can effectually guard

 unforeseen in the organization of the government and force on the treasury by early necessity the practice of employ bank be in truth from the beginning more a measure of emergency than of sound policy when we start into existence as a nation in addition to the burden of the new government we assume all the large but honorable load of debt which be the price of our liberty but we hesitate to weigh down the infant industry of the country by resort to adequate taxation for the necessary revenue the facility of bank in return for the privilege they acquire be promptly offer and perhaps too readily receive by an embarrassed treasury during the long continuance of a national debt and the intervene difficulty of a foreign war the connection be continue from motive of convenience but these cause have long since pass away we have no emergency that make bank necessary to aid the want of the treasury we have no load of national debt to provide for and we have on actual deposit a large surplus no public interest therefore now require the renewal of a connection that circumstance have dissolve the complete organization of our government the abundance of our resource the general harmony which prevail between the different states and with foreign power all enable we now to select the system most consistent with the constitution and most conducive to the public welfare should we then connect the treasury for a fourth time with the local bank it can only be under a conviction that past failure have arise from accidental not inherent defect

 a danger difficult if not impossible to be avoid in such an arrangement be make strikingly evident in the very event by which it have now be defeat a sudden act of the bank intrust with the fund of the people deprive the treasury without fault or agency of the government of the ability to pay its creditor in the currency they have by law a right to demand this circumstance no fluctuation of commerce could have produce if the public revenue have be collect in the legal currency and keep in that form by the officer of the treasury the citizen whose money be in bank receive it back since the suspension at a sacrifice in its amount whilst he who keep it in the legal currency of the country and in his own possession pursue without loss the current of his business the government place in the situation of the former be involve in embarrassment it could not have suffer have it pursue the course of the latter these embarrassment be moreover augment by those salutary and just law which forbid it to use a depreciated currency and by so do take from the government the ability which individual have of accommodate their transaction to such a catastrophe

 a system which can in a time of profound peace when there be a large revenue lay by thus suddenly prevent the application and the use of the money of the people in the manner and for the object they have direct can not be wise but who can think without painful reflection that under it the same unforeseen event might have befall we in the midst of a war and take from we at the moment when most want the use of those very mean which be treasure up to promote the national welfare and guard our national right to such embarrassment and to such danger will this government be always expose whilst it take the money raise for and necessary to the public service out of the hand of its own officer and convert they into a mere right of action against corporation intrust with the possession of they nor can such result be effectually guard against in such a system without invest the executive with a control over the bank themselves whether state or national that might with reason be object to ours be probably the only government in the world that be liable in the management of its fiscal concern to occurrence like these

 but this imminent risk be not the only danger attendant on the surrender of the public money to the custody and control of local corporation though the object be aid to the treasury its effect may be to introduce into the operation of the government influence the most subtle found on interest the most selfish

 the use by the bank for their own benefit of the money deposit with they have receive the sanction of the government from the commencement of this connection the money receive from the people instead of be keep till it be need for their use be in consequence of this authority a fund on which discount be make for the profit of those who happen to be owner of stock in the bank select as depository the supposed and often exaggerated advantage of such a boon will always cause it to be seek for with avidity i will not stop to consider on whom the patronage incident to it be to be confer whether the selection and control be trust to congress or to the executive either will be subject to appeal make in every form which the sagacity of interest can suggest the bank under such a system be stimulate to make the most of their fortunate acquisition the deposit be treat as an increase of capital loan and circulation be rashly augmented and when the public exigency require a return it be attend with embarrassment not provide for nor foresee thus bank that think themselves most fortunate when the public fund be receive find themselves most embarrassed when the season of payment suddenly arrive

 unfortunately too the evil of the system be not limit to the bank it stimulate a general rashness of enterprise and aggravate the fluctuation of commerce and the currency this result be strikingly exhibit during the operation of the late deposit system and especially in the purchase of public land the order which ultimately direct the payment of gold and silver in such purchase greatly check but could not altogether prevent the evil specie be indeed more difficult to be procure than the note which the bank could themselves create at pleasure but still be obtain from they as a loan and return as a deposit which they be again at liberty to use it only pass round the circle with diminished speed this operation could not have be perform have the fund of the government go into the treasury to be regularly disburse and not into bank to be loan out for their own profit while they be permit to substitute for it a credit in account

 in express these sentiment i desire not to undervalue the benefit of a salutary credit to any branch of enterprise the credit bestow on probity and industry be the just reward of merit and an honorable incentive to further acquisition none oppose it who love their country and understand its welfare but when it be unduly encourage when it be make to inflame the public mind with the temptation of sudden and unsubstantial wealth when it turn industry into path that lead soon or later to disappointment and distress it become liable to censure and need correction far from help probity and industry the ruin to which it lead fall most severely on the great labor class who be throw suddenly out of employment and by the failure of magnificent scheme never intend to enrich they be deprive in a moment of their only resource abuse of credit and excess in speculation will happen in despite of the most salutary law no government perhaps can altogether prevent they but surely every government can refrain from contribute the stimulus that call they into life

 since therefore experience have show that to lend the public money to the local bank be hazardous to the operation of the government at least of doubtful benefit to the institution themselves and productive of disastrous derangement in the business and currency of the country be it the part of wisdom again to renew the connection

 it be true that such an agency be in many respect convenient to the treasury but it be not indispensable a limitation of the expense of the government to its actual want and of the revenue to those expense with convenient mean for its prompt application to the purpose for which it be raise be the object which we should seek to accomplish the collection safe keeping transfer and disbursement of the public money can it be believe be well manage by officer of the government its collection and to a great extent its disbursement also have indeed be hitherto conduct solely by they neither national nor state bank when employ be require to do more than keep it safely while in their custody and transfer and pay it in such portion and at such time as the treasury shall direct

 surely bank be not more able than the government to secure the money in their possession against accident violence or fraud the assertion that they be so must assume that a vault in a bank be strong than a vault in the treasury and that director cashier and clerk not select by the government nor under its control be more worthy of confidence than officer select from the people and responsible to the government officer bind by official oath and bond for a faithful performance of their duty and constantly subject to the supervision of congress

 the difficulty of transfer and the aid heretofore render by bank have be less than be usually suppose the actual account show that by far the large portion of payment be make within short or convenient distance from the place of collection and the whole number of warrant issue at the treasury in the yea 1834 -a year the result of which will it be believe afford a safe test for the future fall short of 5,000 or an average of less than 1 daily for each state in the city of new york they do not average more than 2 a day and at the city of washington only 4

 the difficulty heretofore exist be moreover daily lessen by an increase in the cheapness and facility of communication and it may be assert with confidence that the necessary transfer as well as the safe keeping and disbursement of the public money can be with safety and convenience accomplish through the agency of treasury officer this opinion have be in some degree confirm by actual experience since the discontinuance of the bank as fiscal agent in may last a period which from the embarrassment in commercial intercourse present obstacle as great as any that may be hereafter apprehend

 the manner of keep the public money since that period be fully state in the report of the secretary of the treasury that officer also suggest the propriety of assign by law certain additional duty to exist establishment and officer which with the modification and safeguard refer to by he will he think enable the department to continue to perform this branch of the public service without any material addition either to their number or to the present expense the extent of the business to be transact have already be state and in respect to the amount of money with which the officer employ would be intrust at any one time it appear that assume a balance of five million to be at all time keep in the treasury and the whole of it leave in the hand of the collector and receiver the proportion of each would not exceed an average of $ 30,000 but that deduct one million for the use of the mint and assume the remain four million to be in the hand of one half of the present number of officer a supposition deem more likely to correspond with the fact the sum in the hand of each would still be less than the amount of most of the bond now take from the receiver of public money every apprehension however on the subject either in respect to the safety of the money or the faithful discharge of these fiscal transaction may it appear to i be effectually remove by add to the present mean of the treasury the establishment by law at a few important point of office for the deposit and disbursement of such portion of the public revenue as can not with obvious safety and convenience be leave in the possession of the collect officer until pay over by they to the public creditor neither the amount retain in their hand nor those deposit in the office would in an ordinary condition of the revenue be large in most case than those often under the control of disburse officer of the army and navy and might be make entirely safe by require such security and exercise such control supervision as congress may by law prescribe the principal officer whose appointment would become necessary under this plan take the large number suggest by the secretary of the treasury would not exceed ten nor the additional expense at the same estimate $ 60,000 a year

 there can be no doubt of the obligation of those who be intrust with the affair of government to conduct they with as little cost to the nation as be consistent with the public interest and it be for congress and ultimately for the people to decide whether the benefit to be derive from keep our fiscal concern apart and sever the connection which have hitherto exist between the government and bank offer sufficient advantage to justify the necessary expense if the object to be accomplish be deem important to the future welfare of the country i can not allow myself to believe that the addition to the public expenditure of comparatively so small an amount as will be necessary to effect it will be object to by the people

 it will be see by the report of the postmaster general herewith communicate that the fiscal affair of that department have be successfully conduct since may last upon the principle of deal only in the legal currency of the united states and that it need no legislation to maintain its credit and facilitate the management of its concern the exist law be in the opinion of that officer ample for those object

 difficulty will doubtless be encounter for a season and increase service require from the public functionary such be usually incident to the commencement of every system but they will be greatly lessen in the progress of its operation

 the power and influence suppose to be connect with the custody and disbursement of the public money be topic on which the public mind be naturally and with great propriety peculiarly sensitive much have be say on they in reference to the propose separation of the government from the banking institution and surely no one can object to any appeal or animadversion on the subject which be consistent with fact and evince a proper respect for the intelligence of the people if a chief magistrate may be allow to speak for himself on such a point i can truly say that to i nothing would be more acceptable than the withdrawal from the executive to the great practicable extent of all concern in the custody and disbursement of the public revenue not that i would shrink from any responsibility cast upon i by the duty of my office but because it be my firm belief that its capacity for usefulness be in no degree promote by the possession of any patronage not actually necessary to the performance of those duty but under our present form of government the intervention of the executive officer in the custody and disbursement of the public money seem to be unavoidable and before it can be admit that the influence and power of the executive would be increase by dispense with the agency of bank the nature of that intervention in such an agency must be carefully regard and a comparison must be institute between its extent in the two case

 the revenue can only be collect by officer appoint by the president with the advice and consent of the senate the public money in the first instance must therefore in all case pass through hand select by the executive other officer appoint in the same way or as in some case by the president alone must also be intrust with they when draw for the purpose of disbursement it be thus see that even when bank be employ the public fund must twice pass through the hand of executive officer besides this the head of the treasury department who also hold office at the pleasure of the president and some other officer of the same department must necessarily be invest with more or less power in the selection continuance and supervision of the bank that may be employ the question be then narrow to the single point whether in the intermediate stage between the collection and disbursement of the public money the agency of bank be necessary to avoid a dangerous extension of the patronage and influence of the executive but be it clear that the connection of the executive with powerful moneyed institution capable of minister to the interest of man in point where they be most accessible to corruption be less liable to abuse than his constitutional agency in the appointment and control of the few public officer require by the propose plan will the public money when in their hand be necessarily expose to any improper interference on the part of the executive may it not be hope that a prudent fear of public jealousy and disapprobation in a matter so peculiarly expose to they will deter he from any such interference even if high motive be find inoperative may not congress so regulate by law the duty of those officer and subject it to such supervision and publicity as to prevent the possibility of any serious abuse on the part of the executive and be there equal room for such supervision and publicity in a connection with bank act under the shield of corporate immunity and conduct by person irresponsible to the government and the people it be believe that a considerate and candid investigation of these question will result in the conviction that the propose plan be far less liable to objection on the score of executive patronage and control than any bank agency that have be or can be devise

 with these view i leave to congress the measure necessary to regulate in the present emergency the safe keeping and transfer of the public money in the performance of constitutional duty i have state to they without reserve the result of my own reflection the subject be of great importance and one on which we can scarcely expect to be as unite in sentiment as we be in interest it deserve a full and free discussion and can not fail to be benefit by a dispassionate comparison of opinion well aware myself of the duty of reciprocal concession among the coordinate branch of the government i can promise a reasonable spirit of cooperation so far as it can be indulge in without the surrender of constitutional objection which i believe to be well found any system that may be adopt should be subject to the full legal provision so as to leave nothing to the executive but what be necessary to the discharge of the duty impose on he and whatever plan may be ultimately establish my own part shall be so discharged as to give to it a fair trial and the good prospect of success

 the character of the fund to be receive and disburse in the transaction of the government likewise demand your most careful consideration

 there can be no doubt that those who frame and adopt the constitution have in immediate view the depreciate paper of the confederacy of which $ 500 in paper be at time only equal to $ 1 in coin intend to prevent the recurrence of similar evil so far at least as relate to the transaction of the new government they give to congress express power to coin money and to regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin they refuse to give it power to establish corporation the agent then as now chiefly employ to create a paper currency they prohibit the states from make anything but gold and silver a legal tender in payment of debt and the first congress direct by positive law that the revenue should be receive in nothing but gold and silver

 public exigency at the outset of the government without direct legislative authority lead to the use of bank as fiscal aid to the treasury in admit deviation from the law at the same period and under the same exigency the secretary of the treasury receive their note in payment of duty the sole ground on which the practice thus commence be then or have since be justify be the certain immediate and convenient exchange of such note for specie the government do indeed receive the inconvertible note of state bank during the difficulty of war and the community submit without a murmur to the unequal taxation and multiply evil of which such a course be productive with the war this indulgence cease and the bank be oblige again to redeem their note in gold and silver the treasury in accordance with previous practice continue to dispense with the currency require by the act of 1789 and take the note of bank in full confidence of their be pay in specie on demand and congress to guard against the slight violation of this principle have declare by law that if note be pay in the transaction of the government it must be under such circumstance as to enable the holder to convert they into specie without depreciation or delay

 of my own duty under the exist law when the bank suspend specie payment i could not doubt direction be immediately give to prevent the reception into the treasury of anything but gold and silver or its equivalent and every practicable arrangement be make to preserve the public faith by similar or equivalent payment to the public creditor the revenue from land have be for some time substantially so collect under the order issue by direction of my predecessor the effect of that order have be so salutary and its forecast in regard to the increase insecurity of bank paper have become so apparent that even before the catastrophe i have resolve not to interfere with its operation congress be now to decide whether the revenue shall continue to be so collected or not

 the receipt into the treasury of bank note not redeem in specie on demand will not i presume be sanction it would destroy without the excuse of war or public distress that equality of impost and identity of commercial regulation which lie at the foundation of our confederacy and would offer to each state a direct temptation to increase its foreign trade by depreciate the currency receive for duty in its port such a proceeding would also in a great degree frustrate the policy so highly cherished of infuse into our circulation a large proportion of the precious metal a policy the wisdom of which none can doubt though there may be different opinion as to the extent to which it should be carry its result have be already too auspicious and its success be too closely interweave with the future prosperity of the country to permit we for a moment to contemplate its abandonment we have see under its influence our specie augment beyond eighty million our coinage increase so as to make that of gold amount between august 1834 and december 1836 to $ 10,000,000 exceed the whole coinage at the mint during the thirty one previous year

 the prospect of further improvement continue without abatement until the moment of the suspension of specie payment this policy have now indeed be suddenly check but be still far from be overthrow amidst all conflict theory one position be undeniable the precious metal will invariably disappear when there cease to be a necessity for their use as a circulate medium it be in strict accordance with this truth that whilst in the month of may last they be everywhere see and be current for all ordinary purpose they disappear from circulation the moment the payment of specie be refuse by the bank and the community tacitly agree to dispense with its employment their place be supply by a currency exclusively of paper and in many case of the bad description already be the bank note now in circulation greatly depreciate and they fluctuate in value between one place and another thus diminish and make uncertain the worth of property and the price of labor and fail to subserve except at a heavy loss the purpose of business with each succeed day the metallic currency decrease by some it be hoard in the natural fear that once part with it can not be replace while by other it be divert from its more legitimate use for the sake of gain should congress sanction this condition of thing by make irredeemable paper money receivable in payment of public due a temporary check to a wise and salutary policy will in all probability be convert into its absolute destruction

 it be true that bank note actually convertible into specie may be receive in payment of the revenue without be liable to all these objection and that such a course may to some extent promote individual convenience an object always to be consider where it do not conflict with the principle of our government or the general welfare of the country if such note only be receive and always under circumstance allow their early presentation for payment and if at short and fix period they be convert into specie to be keep by the officer of the treasury some of the most serious obstacle to their reception would perhaps be remove to retain the note in the treasury would be to renew under another form the loan of public money to the bank and the evil consequent thereon

 it be however a mistaken impression that any large amount of specie be require for public payment of the seventy or eighty million now estimate to be in the country ten million would be abundantly sufficient for that purpose provide an accumulation of a large amount of revenue beyond the necessary want of the government be hereafter prevent if to these consideration be add the facility which will arise from enable the treasury to satisfy the public creditor by its draft or note receivable in payment of the public due it may be safely assume that no motive of convenience to the citizen require the reception of bank paper

 to say that the refusal of paper money by the government introduce an unjust discrimination between the currency receive by it and that use by individual in their ordinary affair be in my judgment to view it in a very erroneous light the constitution prohibit the states from make anything but gold and silver a tender in the payment of debt and thus secure to every citizen a right to demand payment in the legal currency to provide by law that the government will only receive its due in gold and silver be not to confer on it any peculiar privilege but merely to place it on an equality with the citizen by reserve to it a right secure to he by the constitution it be doubtless for this reason that the principle have be sanction by successive law from the time of the first congress under the constitution down to the last such precedent never object to and proceed from such source afford a decisive answer to the imputation of inequality or injustice

 but in fact the measure be one of restriction not of favor to forbid the public agent to receive in payment any other than a certain kind of money be to refuse he a discretion possess by every citizen it may be leave to those who have the management of their own transaction to make their own term but no such discretion should be give to he who act merely as an agent of the people who be to collect what the law require and to pay the appropriation it make when bank note be redeem on demand there be then no discrimination in reality for the individual who receive they may at his option substitute the specie for they he take they from convenience or choice when they be not so redeem it will scarcely be contend that their receipt and payment by a public officer should be permit though none deny that right to an individual if it be the effect would be most injurious to the public since their officer could make none of those arrangement to meet or guard against the depreciation which an individual be at liberty to do nor can inconvenience to the community be allege as an objection to such a regulation its object and motive be their convenience and welfare

 if at a moment of simultaneous and unexpected suspension by the bank it add something to the many embarrassment of that proceeding yet these be far overbalanced by its direct tendency to produce a wide circulation of gold and silver to increase the safety of bank paper to improve the general currency and thus to prevent altogether such occurrence and the other and far great evil that attend they

 it may indeed be question whether it be not for the interest of the bank themselves that the government should not receive their paper they would be conduct with more caution and on sounder principle by use specie only in its transaction the government would create a demand for it which would to a great extent prevent its exportation and by keep it in circulation maintain a broad and safe basis for the paper currency that the bank would thus be render more sound and the community more safe can not admit of a doubt

 the foregoing view it seem to i do but fairly carry out the provision of the federal constitution in relation to the currency as far as relate to the public revenue at the time that instrument be frame there be but three or four bank in the united states and have the extension of the banking system and the evil grow out of it be foresee they would probably have be specially guard against the same policy which lead to the prohibition of bill of credit by the states would doubtless in that event have also interdict their issue as a currency in any other form the constitution however contain no such prohibition and since the states have exercise for nearly half a century the power to regulate the business of banking it be not to be expect that it will be abandon the whole matter be now under discussion before the proper tribunal the people of the states never before have the public mind be so thoroughly awaken to a proper sense of its importance never have the subject in all its bearing be submit to so search an inquiry it would be distrust the intelligence and virtue of the people to doubt the speedy and efficient adoption of such measure of reform as the public good demand all that can rightfully be do by the federal government to promote the accomplishment of that important object will without doubt be perform

 in the meantime it be our duty to provide all the remedy against a depreciate paper currency which the constitution enable we to afford the treasury department on several former occasion have suggest the propriety and importance of a uniform law concern bankruptcy of corporation and other banker through the instrumentality of such a law a salutary check may doubtless be impose on the issue of paper money and an effectual remedy give to the citizen in a way at once equal in all part of the union and fully authorize by the constitution

 the indulgence grant by executive authority in the payment of bond for duty have be already mention see that the immediate enforcement of these obligation would subject a large and highly respectable portion of our citizen to great sacrifice and believe that a temporary postponement could be make without detriment to other interest and with increase certainty of ultimate payment i do not hesitate to comply with the request that be make of i the term allow be to the full extent as liberal as any that be to be find in the practice of the executive department it remain for congress to decide whether a further postponement may not with propriety be allow and if so their legislation upon the subject be respectfully invite

 the report of the secretary of the treasury will exhibit the condition of these debt the extent and effect of the present indulgence the probable result of its further extension on the state of the treasury and every other fact necessary to a full consideration of the subject similar information be communicate in regard to such depository of the public money as be indebted to the government in order that congress may also adopt the proper measure in regard to they

 the receipt and expenditure for the first half of the year and an estimate of those for the residue will be lay before you by the secretary of the treasury in his report of december last it be estimate that the current receipt would fall short of the expenditure by about $ 3,000,000 it will be see that the difference will be much great this be to be attribute not only to the occurrence of great pecuniary embarrassment in the business of the country than those which be then predict and consequently a great diminution in the revenue but also to the fact that the appropriation exceed by nearly six million the amount which be ask for in the estimate then submit the sum necessary for the service of the year beyond the probable receipt and the amount which it be intend should be reserve in the treasury at the commencement of the year will be about six million if the whole of the reserved balance be not at once apply to the current expenditure but four million be still keep in the treasury as seem most expedient for the use of the mint and to meet contingency the sum need will be ten million

 in make this estimate the receipt be calculate on the supposition of some further extension of the indulgence grant in the payment of bond for duty which will affect the amount of the revenue for the present year to the extent of two and a half million

 it be not propose to procure the require amount by loan or increase taxation there be now in the treasury $ 9,367,214 direct by the act of the 23d of june 1836 to be deposit with the states in october next this sum if so deposit will be subject under the law to be recall if need to defray exist appropriation and as it be now evident that the whole or the principal part of it will be want for that purpose it appear most proper that the deposit should be withhold until the amount can be collect from the bank treasury note may be temporarily issue to be gradually redeem as it be receive

 i be aware that this course may be productive of inconvenience to many of the states rely upon the act of congress which hold out to they the strong probability if not the certainty of receive this installment they have in some instance adopt measure with which its retention may seriously interfere that such a condition of thing should have occur be much to be regret it be not the least among the unfortunate result of the disaster of the time and it be for congress to devise a fit remedy if there be one the money be indispensable to the want of the treasury it be difficult to conceive upon what principle of justice or expediency its application to that object can be avoid to recall any portion of the sum already deposit with the states would be more inconvenient and less efficient to burden the country with increase taxation when there be in fact a large surplus revenue would be unjust and unwise to raise money by loan under such circumstance and thus to commence a new national debt would scarcely be sanction by the american people

 the plan propose will be adequate to all our fiscal operation during the remainder of the year should it be adopt the treasury aid by the ample resource of the country will be able to discharge punctually every pecuniary obligation for the future all that be need will be that caution and forbearance in appropriation which the diminution of the revenue require and which the complete accomplishment or great forwardness of many expensive national undertaking render equally consistent with prudence and patriotic liberality

 the precede suggestion and recommendation be submit in the belief that their adoption by congress will enable the executive department to conduct our fiscal concern with success so far as their management have be commit to it whilst the object and the mean propose to attain they be within its constitutional power and appropriate duty they will at the same time it be hope by their necessary operation afford essential aid in the transaction of individual concern and thus yield relief to the people at large in a form adapt to the nature of our government those who look to the action of this government for specific aid to the citizen to relieve embarrassment arise from loss by revulsion in commerce and credit lose sight of the end for which it be create and the power with which it be clothe it be establish to give security to we all in our lawful and honorable pursuit under the last safeguard of republican institution it be not intend to confer special favor on individual or on any class of they to create system of agriculture manufacture or trade or to engage in they either separately or in connection with individual citizen or organized association if its operation be to be direct for the benefit of any one class equivalent favor must in justice be extend to the rest and the attempt to bestow such favor with an equal hand or even to select those who should most deserve they would never be successful

 all community be apt to look to government for too much even in our own country where its power and duty be so strictly limited we be prone to do so especially at period of sudden embarrassment and distress but this ought not to be the framer of our excellent constitution and the people who approve it with calm and sagacious deliberation act at the time on a sounder principle they wisely judge that the less government interfere with private pursuit the well for the general prosperity it be not its legitimate object to make man rich or to repair by direct grant of money or legislation in favor of particular pursuit loss not incur in the public service this would be substantially to use the property of some for the benefit of other but its real duty that duty the performance of which make a good government the most precious of human blessing be to enact and enforce a system of general law commensurate with but not exceed the object of its establishment and to leave every citizen and every interest to reap under its benign protection the reward of virtue industry and prudence

 i can not doubt that on this as on all similar occasion the federal government will find its agency most conducive to the security and happiness of the people when limit to the exercise of its conceded power in never assume even for a well mean object such power as be not design to be confer upon it we shall in reality do most for the general welfare to avoid every unnecessary intereference with the pursuit of the citizen will result in more benefit than to adopt measure which could only assist limited interest and be eagerly but perhaps naturally seek for under the pressure of temporary circumstance if therefore i refrain from suggest to congress any specific plan for regulate the exchange of the country relieve mercantile embarrassment or interfere with the ordinary operation of foreign or domestic commerce it be from a conviction that such measure be not within the constitutional province of the general government and that their adoption would not promote the real and permanent welfare of those they might be design to aid

 the difficulty and distress of the time though unquestionably great be limit in their extent and can not be regard as affect the permanent prosperity of the nation arise in a great degree from the transaction of foreign and domestic commerce it be upon they that they have chiefly fall the great agricultural interest have in many part of the country suffer comparatively little and as if providence intend to display the munifence of its goodness at the moment of our great need and in direct contrast to the evil occasion by the waywardness of man we have be bless throughout our extend territory with a season of general health and of uncommon fruitfulness the proceed of our great staple will soon furnish the mean of liquidate debt at home and abroad and contribute equally to the revival of commercial activity and the restoration of commercial credit the bank establish avowedly for its support derive their profit from it and rest under obligation to it which can not be overlook will feel at once the necessity and justice of unite their energy with those of the mercantile interest

 the suspension of specie payment at such a time and under such circumstance as we have lately witness could not be other than a temporary measure and we can scarcely err in believe that the period must soon arrive when all that be solvent will redeem their issue in gold and silver dealing abroad naturally depend on resource and prosperity at home if the debt of our merchant have accumulate or their credit be impaired these be fluctuation always incident to extensive or extravagant mercantile transaction but the ultimate security of such obligation do not admit of question they be guarantee by the resource of a country the fruit of whose indutry afford abundant mean of ample liquidation and by the evident interest of every merchant to sustain a credit hitherto high by promptly apply these mean for its preservation

 i deeply regret that event have occur which require i to ask your consideration of such serious topic i could have wish that in make my first communication to the assemble representative of my country i have nothing to dwell upon but the history of her unalloyed prosperity since it be otherwise we can only feel more deeply the responsibility of the respective trust that have be confide to we and under the pressure of difficulty unite in invoke the guidance and aid of the supreme ruler of nations and in labor with zealous resolution to overcome the difficulty by which we be environ

 it be under such circumstance a high gratification to know by long experience that we act for a people to whom the truth however unpromising can always be speak with safety for the trial of whose patriotism no emergency be too severe and who be sure never to desert a public functionary honestly labor for the public good it seem just that they should receive without delay any aid in their embarrassment which your deliberation can afford come directly from the midst of they and know the course of event in every section of our country from you may well be learn as well the extent and nature of these embarrassment as the most desirable measure of relief

 i be aware however that it be not proper to detain you at present long than may be demand by the special object for which you be convene to they therefore i have confine my communication and believe it will not be your own wish now to extend your deliberation beyond they i reserve till the usual period of your annual meeting that general information on the state of the union which the constitution require i to give

 m. van buren
fellow citizen of the senate and house of representatives we have reason to renew the expression of our devout gratitude to the giver of all good for his benign protection our country present on every side the evidence of that continue favor under whose auspex it have gradually rise from a few feeble and dependent colony to a prosperous and powerful confederacy we be bless with domestic tranquillity and all the element of national prosperity the pestilence which invade for a time some flourish portion of the union interrupt the general prevalence of unusual health have happily be limit in extent and arrest in its fatal career the industry and prudence of our citizen be gradually relieve they from the pecuniary embarrassment under which portion of they have labor judicious legislation and the natural and boundless resource of the country have afford wise end timely aid to private enterprise and the activity always characteristic of our people have already in a great degree resume its usual and profitable channel the condition of our foreign relation have not materially change since the last annual message of my predecessor we remain at peace with all nation and no effort on my part consistent with the preservation of our right and the honor of the country shall be spare to maintain a position so consonant to our institution we have faithfully sustain the foreign policy with which the united states under the guidance of their first president take their stand in the family of nation that of regulate their intercourse with other power by the approve principle of private life ask and accord equal right and equal privilege render and demand justice in all case advance their own and discuss the pretension of other with candor directness and sincerity appeal at all time to reason but never yield to force nor seek to acquire anything for themselves by its exercise a rigid adherence to this policy have leave this government with scarcely a claim upon its justice for injury arise from act commit by its authority the most imposing and perplexing of those of the united states upon foreign government for aggression upon our citizen be dispose of by my predecessor independently of the benefit confer upon our citizen by restore to the mercantile community so many million of which they have be wrongfully divest a great service be also render to his country by the satisfactory adjustment of so many ancient and irritate subject of contention and it reflect no ordinary credit on his successful administration of public affair that this great object be accomplish without compromise on any occasion either the honor or the peace of the nation with european power no new subject of difficulty have arise and those which be under discussion although not terminate do not present a more unfavorable aspect for the future preservation of that good understanding which it have ever be our desire to cultivate of pende question the most important be that which exist with the government of great britain in respect to our northeastern boundary it be with unfeigned regret that the people of the united states must look back upon the abortive effort make by the executive for a period of more than half a century to determine what no nation should suffer long to remain in dispute the true line which divide its possession from those of other power the nature of the settlement on the border of the united states and of the neighboring territory be for a season such that this perhaps be not indispensable to a faithful performance of the duty of the federal government time have however change this state of thing and have bring about a condition of affair in which the true interest of both country imperatively require that this question should be put at rest it be not to be disguise that with full confidence often express in the desire of the british government to terminate it we be apparently as far from its adjustment as we be at the time of sign the treaty of peace in 1783 the sole result of long pende negotiation and a perplexing arbitration appear to be a conviction on its part that a conventional line must be adopt from the impossibility of ascertain the true one accord to the description contain in that treaty without coincide in this opinion which be not think to be well rounded my predecessor give the strong proof of the earnest desire of the united states to terminate satisfactorily this dispute by propose the substitution of a conventional line if the consent of the states interested in the question could be obtain to this proposition no answer have as yet be receive the attention of the british government have however be urgently invite to the subject and its reply can not i be confident be much long delay the general relation between great britain and the united states be of the most friendly character and i be well satisfied of the sincere disposition of that government to maintain they upon their present footing this disposition have also i be persuade become more general with the people of england than at any previous period it be scarcely necessary to say to you how cordially it be reciprocate by the government and people of the united states the conviction which must be common to all of the injurious consequence that result from keep open this irritate question and the certainty that its final settlement can not be much long defer will i trust lead to an early and satisfactory adjustment at your last session i lay before you the recent communication between the two government and between this government and that of the state of maine in whose solicitude concern a subject in which she have so deep an interest every portion of the union participate the feeling produce by a temporary interruption of those harmonious relation between france and the united states which be due as well to the recollection of former time as to a correct appreciation of exist interest have be happily succeed by a cordial disposition on both side to cultivate an active friendship in their future intercourse the opinion undoubtedly correct and steadily entertain by we that the commercial relation at present exist between the two country be susceptible of great and reciprocally beneficial improvement be obviously gain ground in france and i be assure of the disposition of that government to favor the accomplishment of such an object this disposition shall be meet in a proper spirit on our part the few and comparatively unimportant question that remain to be adjust between we can i have no doubt be settle with entire satisfaction and without difficulty between russia and the united states sentiment of good will continue to be mutually cherished our minister recently accredit to that court have be receive with a frankness and cordiality and with evidence of respect for his country which leave we no room to doubt the preservation in future of those amicable and liberal relation which have so long and so uninterruptedly exist between the two country on the few subject under discussion between we an early and just decision be confidently anticipate a correspondence have be open with the government of austria for the establishment of diplomatic relation in conformity with the wish of congress as indicate by an appropriation act of the session of 1837 and arrangement make for the purpose which will be duly carry into effect with austria and prussia and with the states of the german empire now compose with the latter the commercial league our political relation be of the most friendly character whilst our commercial intercourse be gradually extend with benefit to all who be engage in it civil war yet rage in spain produce intense suffering to its own people and to other nation inconvenience and regret our citizen who have claim upon that country will be prejudice for a time by the condition of its treasury the inevitable consequence of long continue and exhaust internal war the last installment of the interest of the debt due under the convention with the queen of spain have not be pay and similar failure may be expect to happen until a portion of the resource of her kingdom can be devoted to the extinguishment of its foreign debt having receive satisfactory evidence that discriminate tonnage duty be charge upon the vessel of the united states in the port of portugal a proclamation be issue on the 11th day of october last in compliance with the act of may 25 1832 declare that fact and the duty on foreign tonnage which be levy upon portuguese vessel in the united states previously to the passage of that act be accordingly revive the act of july 4 1836 suspend the discriminating duty upon the produce of portugal import into this country in portuguese vessel be pass upon the application of that government through its representative here under the belief that no similar discrimination exist in portugal to the prejudice of the united states i regret to state that such duty be now exact in that country upon the cargo of american vessel and as the act refer to vest no discretion in the executive it be for congress to determine upon the expediency of further legislation on the subject against these discrimination affect the vessel of this country and their cargoes seasonable remonstrance be make and notice be give to the portuguese government that unless they should be discontinue the adoption of countervail measure on the part of the united states would become necessary but the reply of that government receive at the department of state through our charge d'affaires at lisbon in the month of september last afford no ground to hope for the abandonment of a system so little in harmony with the treatment show to the vessel of portugal and their cargo in the port of this country and so contrary to the expectation we have a right to entertain with holland sweden denmark naples and belgium a friendly intercourse have be uninterruptedly maintain with the government of the ottoman porte and its dependency on the coast of the mediterranean peace and good will are carefully cultivate and have be foster by such good office as the relative distance and the condition of those country would permit our commerce with greece be carry on under the law of the two government reciprocally beneficial to the navigate interest of both and i have reason to look forward to the adoption of other measure which will be more extensively and permanently advantageous copy of the treaty conclude with the government of siam and muscat be transmit for the information of congress the ratification having be receive and the treaty make public since the close of the last annual session already have we reason to congratulate ourselves on the prospect of considerable commercial benefit and we have besides receive from the sultan of muscat prompt evidence of his desire to cultivate the most friendly feeling by liberal act toward one of our vessel bestow in a manner so striking as to require on our part a grateful acknowledgment our commerce with the island of cuba and porto rico still labor under heavy restriction the continuance of which be a subject of regret the only effect of an adherence to they will be to benefit the navigation of other country at the expense of both the united states and spain the independent nation of this continent have ever since they emerge from the colonial state experience severe trial in their progress to the permanent establishment of liberal political institution their unsettled condition not only interrupt their own advance to prosperity but have often seriously injure the other power of the world the claim of our citizen upon peru chili brazil the argentine republic the government form out of the republics of colombia and mexico be still pende although many of they have be present for examination more than twenty year new granada venezuela and ecuador have recently form a convention for the purpose of ascertain and adjust claim upon the republic of colombia from which it be earnestly hope our citizen will ere long receive full compensation for the injury inflict upon they and for the delay in afford it an advantageous treaty of commerce have be conclude by the united states with the peru bolivian confederation which want only the ratification of that government the progress of a subsequent negotiation for the settlement of claim upon peru have be unfavorably affect by the war between that power and chili and the argentine republic and the same event be also likely to produce delay in the settlement of out demand on those power the aggravating circumstance connect with our claim upon mexico and a variety of event touch the honor and integrity of our government lead my predecessor to make at the second session of the last congress a special recommendation of the course to be pursue to obtain a speedy and final satisfaction of the injury complain of by this government and by our citizen he recommend a final demand of redress with a contingent authority to the executive to make reprisal if that demand should be make in vain from the proceeding of congress on that recommendation it appear that the opinion of both branch of the legislature coincide with that of the executive that any mode of redress know to the law of nation might justifiably be use it be obvious too that congress believe with the president that another demand should be make in order to give undeniable and satisfactory proof of our desire to avoid extremity with a neighboring power but that there be an indisposition to vest a discretionary authority in the executive to take redress should it unfortunately be either deny or unreasonably delay by the mexican government so soon as the necessary document be prepare after enter upon the duty of my office a special messenger be send to mexico to make a final demand of redress with the document require by the provision of our treaty the demand be make on the 20th of july last the reply which bear date the 29th of the same month contain assurance of a desire on the part of that government to give a prompt and explicit answer respect each of the complaint but that the examination of they would necessarily be deliberate that in this examination it would be guide by the principle of public law and the obligation of treaty that nothing should be leave undo that might lead to the most speedy and equitable adjustment of our demand and that its determination in respect to each case should be communicate through the mexican minister here since that time an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary have be accredit to this government by that of the mexican republic he bring with he assurance of a sincere desire that the pende difference between the two government should be terminate in a manner satisfactory to both he be receive with reciprocal assurance and a hope be entertain that his mission would lead to a speedy satisfactory and final adjustment of all exist subject of complaint a sincere believer in the wisdom of the pacific policy by which the united states have always be govern in their intercourse with foreign nation it be my particular desire from the proximity of the mexican republic and well know occurrence on our frontier to be instrumental in obviate all exist difficulty with that government and in restore to the intercourse between the two republics that liberal and friendly character by which they should always be distinguish i regret therefore the more deeply to have find in the recent communication of that government so little reason to hope that any future effort of mine for the accomplishment of those desirable object would be successful although the large number and many of they aggravate case of personal wrong have be now for year before the mexican government and some of the cause of national complaint and those of the most offensive character admit of immediate simple and satisfactory reply it be only within a few day past that any specific communication in answer to our last demand make five month ago have be receive from the mexican minister by the report of the secretary of state herewith present and the accompany document it will be see that for not one of our public complaint have satisfaction be give or offer that but one of the case of personal wrong have be favorably consider and that but four case of both description out of all those formally present and earnestly pressed have as yet be decide upon by the mexican government not perceive in what manner any of the power give to the executive alone could be far usefully employ in bring this unfortunate controversy to a satisfactory termination the subject be by my predecessor refer to congress as one call for its interposition in accordance with the clearly understand wish of the legislature another and formal demand for satisfaction have be make upon the mexican government with what success the document now communicate will show on a careful and deliberate examination of their content and consider the spirit manifest by the mexican government it have become my painful duty to return the subject as it now stand to congress to whom it belong to decide upon the time the mode and the measure of redress whatever may be your decision it shall be faithfully execute confident that it will be characterize by that moderation and justice which will i trust under all circumstance govern the council of our country the balance in the treasury on the 1st january 1837 be $ 45,968,523 the receipt during the present year from all source include the amount of treasury note issue be estimate at $ 23,499,981 constitute an aggregate of $ 69,468,504 of this amount about $ 35,281,361 will have be expend at the end of the year on appropriation make by congress and the residue amount to $ 34,187,143 will be the nominal balance in the treasury on the 1st of january next but of that sum only $ 1,085,498 be consider as immediately available for and applicable to public purpose those portion of it which will be for some time unavailable consist chiefly of sum deposit with the states and due from the former deposit bank the detail upon this subject will be find in the annual report of the secretary of the treasury the amount of treasury note which it will be necessary to issue during the year on account of those fund be unavailable will it be suppose not exceed four and a half million it seem proper in the condition of the country to have the estimate on all subject make as low as practicable without prejudice to any great public measure the departments be therefore desire to prepare their estimate accordingly and i be happy to find that they have be able to graduate they on so economical a scale in the great and often unexpected fluctuation to which the revenue be subject it be not possible to compute the receipt beforehand with great certainty but should they not differ essentially from present anticipation and should the appropriation not much exceed the estimate no difficulty seem likely to happen in defray the current expense with promptitude and fidelity notwithstanding the great embarrassment which have recently occur in commercial affair and the liberal indulgence which in consequence of these embarrassment have be extend to both the merchant and the bank it be gratify to be able to anticipate that the treasury note which have be issue during the present year will be redeem and that the resource of the treasury without any resort to loan or increase taxis will prove ample for defray all charge impose on it during 1838 the report of the secretary of the treasury will afford you a more minute exposition of all matter connect with the administration of the finance during the current year a period which for the amount of public money disburse and deposit with the states as well as the financial difficulty encounter and overcome have few parallel in our history your attention be at the last session invite to the necessity of additional legislative provision in respect to the collection safe keeping and transfer of the public money no law having be then mature and not understand the proceeding of congress as intend to be final it become my duty again to bring the subject to your notice on that occasion three mode of perform this branch of the public service be present for consideration these be the creation of a national bank the revival with modification of the deposit system establish by the act of the 23d of june 1836 permit the use of the public money by the bank and the discontinuance of the use of such institution for the purpose refer to with suitable provision for their accomplishment through the agency of public officer consider the opinion of both houses of congress on the first two proposition as express in the negative in which i entirely concur it be unnecessary for i again in to recur to they in respect to the last you have have an opportunity since your adjournment not only to test still further the expediency of the measure by the continue practical operation of such part of it as be now in force but also to discover what should ever be seek for and regard with the utmost deference the opinion and wish of the people the national will be the supreme law of the republic and on all subject within the limit of his constitutional power should be faithfully obey by the public servant since the measure in question be submit to your consideration most of you have enjoy the advantage of personal communication with your constituent for one state only have an election be hold for the federal government but the early day at which it take place deprive the measure under consideration of much of the support it might otherwise have derive from the result local election for state officer have however be hold in several of the states at which the expediency of the plan propose by the executive have be more or less discuss you will i be confident yield to their result the respect due to every expression of the public voice desiring however to arrive at truth and a just view of the subject in all its bearing you will at the same time remember that question of far deep and more immediate local interest than the fiscal plan of the national treasury be involve in those election above all we can not overlook the striking fact that there be at the time in those states more than one hundred and sixty million of bank capital of which large portion be subject to actual forfeiture other large portion uphold only by special and limited legislative indulgence and most of it if not all to a great or less extent dependent for a continuance of its corporate existence upon the will of the state legislature to be then choose apprise of this circumstance you will judge whether it be not most probable that the peculiar condition of that vast interest in these respect the extent to which it have be spread through all the ramification of society its direct connection with the then pende election and the feeling it be calculate to infuse into the canvass have exercise a far great influence over the result than any which could possibly have be produce by a conflict of opinion in respect to a question in the administration of the general government more remote and far less important in its bearing upon that interest i have find no reason to change my own opinion as to the expediency of adopt the system propose be perfectly satisfied that there will be neither stability nor safety either in the fiscal affair of the government or in the pecuniary transaction of individual and corporation so long as a connection exist between they which like the past offer such strong inducement to make they the subject of political agitation indeed i be more than ever convinced of the danger to which the free and unbiased exercise of political opinion the only sure foundation and safeguard of republican government would be expose by any further increase of the already overgrow influence of corporate authority i can not therefore consistently with my view of duty advise a renewal of a connection which circumstance have dissolve the discontinuance of the use of state bank for fiscal purpose ought not to be regard as a measure of hostility toward those institution bank properly establish and conduct be highly useful to the business of the country and will doubtless continue to exist in the states so long as they conform to their law and be find to be safe and beneficial how they should be create what privilege they should enjoy under what responsibility they should act and to what restriction they should be subject be question which as i observe on a previous occasion belong to the states to decide upon their right or the exercise of they the general government can have no motive to encroach its duty toward they be well perform when it refrain from legislate for their special benefit because such legislation would violate the spirit of the constitution and be unjust to other interest when it take no step to impair their usefulness but so manage its own affair as to make it the interest of those institution to strengthen and improve their condition for the security and welfare of the community at large they have no right to insist on a connection with the federal government nor on the use of the public money for their own benefit the object of the measure under consideration be to avoid for the future a compulsory connection of this kind it propose to place the general government in regard to the essential point of the collection safe keeping and transfer of the public money in a situation which shall relieve it from all dependence on the will of irresponsible individual or corporation to withdraw those money from the use of private trade and confide they to agent constitutionally select and control by law to abstain from improper interference with the industry of the people and withhold inducement to improvident dealing on the part of individual to give stability to the concern of the treasury to preserve the measure of the government from the unavoidable reproach that flow from such a connection and the bank themselves from the injurious effect of a suppose participation in the political conflict of the day from which they will otherwise find it difficult to escape these be my view upon this important subject form after careful reflection and with no desire but to arrive at what be most likely to promote the public interest they be now as they be before submit with unfeigned deference for the opinion of other it be hardly to be hope that change so important on a subject so interesting could be make without produce a serious diversity of opinion but so long as those conflict view be keep above the influence of individual or local interest so long as they pursue only the general good and be discuss with moderation and candor such diversity be a benefit not an injury if a majority of congress see the public welfare in a different light and more especially if they should be satisfied that the measure propose would not be acceptable to the people i shall look to their wisdom to substitute such as may be more conducive to the one and more satisfactory to the other in any event they may confidently rely on my hearty cooperation to the full extent to which my view of the constitution and my sense of duty will permit it be obviously important to this branch of the public service and to the business and quiet of the country that the whole subject should in some way be settle and regulate by law and if possible at your present session besides the plan above refer to i be not aware that any one have be suggest except that of keep the public money in the state bank in special deposit this plan be to some extent in accordance with the practice of the government and with the present arrangement of the treasury department which except perhaps during the operation of the late deposit act have always be allow even during the existence of a national bank to make a temporary use of the state bank in particular place for the safe keeping of portion of the revenue this discretionary power might be continue if congress deem it desirable whatever general system be adopt so long as the connection be voluntary we need perhaps anticipate few of those difficulty and little of that dependence on the bank which must attend every such connection when compulsory in its nature and when so arrange as to make the bank a fixed part of the machinery of government it be undoubtedly in the power of congress so to regulate and guard it as to prevent the public money from be apply to the use or intermingle with the affair of individual thus arrange although it would not give to the government that entire control over its own fund which i desire to secure to it by the plan i have propose it would it must be admit in a great degree accomplish one of the object which have recommend that plan to my judgment the separation of the fiscal concern of the government from those of individual or corporation with these observation i recommend the whole matter to your dispassionate reflection confidently hope that some conclusion may be reach by your deliberation which on the one hand shall give safety and stability to the fiscal operation of the government and be consistent on the other with the genius of our institution and with the interest and wish of the great mass of our constituent it be my hope that nothing would occur to make necessary on this occasion any allusion to the late national bank there be circumstance however connect with the present state of its affair that bear so directly on the character of the government and the welfare of the citizen that i should not feel myself excuse in neglecting to notice they the charter which terminate its banking privilege on the 4th of march 1836 continue its corporate power two year more for the sole purpose of close its affair with authority to use the corporate name style and capacity for the purpose of suit for a final settlement and liquidation of the affair and act of the corporation and for the sale and disposition of their estate real personal and mixed but for no other purpose or in any other manner whatsoever just before the banking privilege cease its effect be transfer by the bank to a new state institution then recently incorporate in trust for the discharge of its debt and the settlement of its affair with this trustee by authority of congress an adjustment be subsequently make of the large interest which the government have in the stock of the institution the manner in which a trust unexpectedly create upon the act grant the charter and involve such great public interest have be execute would under any circumstance be a fit subject of inquiry but much more do it deserve your attention when it embrace the redemption of obligation to which the authority and credit of the united states have give value the two year allow be now nearly at an end it be well understand that the trustee have not redeem and cancel the outstanding note of the bank but have reissue and be actually reissue since the 3d of march 1836 the note which have be receive by it to a vast amount accord to its own official statement so late as the 1st of october last nineteen month after- the banking privilege give by the charter have expire it have under its control uncanceled note of the late bank of the united states to the amount of $ 27,561,866 of which $ 6,175,861 be in actual circulation $ 1,468,627 at state bank agency and $ 3,002,390 in transitu thus show that upward of ten million and a half of the note of the old bank be then still keep outstanding the impropriety of this procedure be obvious it be the duty of the trustee to cancel and not to put forth the note of an institution whose concern it have undertake to wind up if the trustee have a right to reissue these note now i can see no reason why it may not continue to do so after the expiration of the two year as no one could have anticipate a course so extraordinary the prohibitory clause of the charter above quote be not accompany by any penalty or other special provision for enforce it nor have we any general law for the prevention of similar act in future but it be not in this view of the subject alone that your interposition be require the united states in settle with the trustee for their stock have withdraw their fund from their former direct liability to the creditor of the old bank yet note of the institution continue to be send forth in its name and apparently upon the authority of the united states the transaction connect with the employment of the bill of the old bank be of vast extent and should they result unfortunately the interest of individual may be deeply compromise without undertake to decide how far or in what form if any the trustee could be make liable for note which contain no obligation on its part or the old bank for such as be put in circulation after the expiration of its charter and without its authority or the government for indemnity in case of loss the question still press itself upon your consideration whether it be consistent with duty and good faith on the part of the government to witness this proceeding without a single effort to arrest it the report of the commissioner of the general land office which will be lay before you by the secretary of the treasury will show how the affair of that office have be conduct for the past year the disposition of the public land be one of the most important trust confide to congress the practicability of retain the title and control of such extensive domain in the general government and at the same time admit the territories embrace they into the federal union as coequal with the original states be seriously doubt by many of our wise statesman all fear that they would become a source of discord and many carry their apprehension so far as to see in they the seed of a future dissolution of the confederacy but happily our experience have already be sufficient to quiet in a great degree all such apprehension the position at one time assume that the admission of new states into the union on the same footing with the original states be incompatible with a right of soil in the united states and operate as a surrender thereof notwithstanding the term of the compact by which their admission be design to be regulate have be wisely abandon whether in the new or the old states all now agree that the right of soil to the public land remain in the federal government and that these land constitute a common property to be dispose of for the common benefit of all the states old and new acquiescence in this just principle by the people of the new states have naturally promote a disposition to adopt the most liberal policy in the sale of the public land a policy which should be limit to the mere object of sell the land for the great possible sum of money without regard to high consideration find but few advocate on the contrary it be generally concede that whilst the mode of disposition adopt by the government should always be a prudent one yet its lead object ought to be the early settlement and cultivation of the land sell and that it should discountenance if it can not prevent the accumulation of large tract in the same hand which must necessarily retard the growth of the new states or entail upon they a dependent tenantry and its attendant evil a question embrace such important interest and so well calculate to enlist the feeling of the people in every quarter of the union have very naturally give rise to numerous plan for the improvement of the exist system the distinctive feature of the policy that have hitherto prevail be to dispose of the public land at moderate price thus enable a great number to enter into competition for their purchase and accomplish a double object of promote their rapid settlement by the purchaser and at the same time increase the receipt of the treasury to sell for cash thereby prevent the disturbing influence of a large mass of private citizen indebte to the government which they have a voice in controlling to bring they into market no fast than good land be suppose to be want for improvement thereby prevent the accumulation of large tract in few hand and to apply the proceed of the sale to the general purpose of the government thus diminish the amount to be raise from the people of the states by taxation and give each state its portion of the benefit to be derive from this common fund in a manner the most quiet and at the same time perhaps the most equitable that can be devise these provision with occasional enactment in behalf of special interest deem entitle to the favor of the government have in their execution produce result as beneficial upon the whole as could reasonably be expect in a matter so vast so complicated and so exciting upward of 70,000,000 acre have be sell the great part of which be believe to have be purchase for actual settlement the population of the new states and territories create out of the public domain increase between 1800 and 1830 from less than 60,000 to upward of 2,300,000 soul constitute at the latter period about one fifth of the whole people of the united states the increase since can not be accurately know but the whole may now be safely estimate at over three and a half million of soul compose nine states the representative of which constitute above one third of the senate and over one sixth of the house of representatives of the united states thus have be form a body of free and independent landholder with a rapidity unequaled in the history of mankind and this great result have be produce without leave anything for future adjustment between the government and its citizen the system under which so much have be accomplish can not be intrinsically bad and with occasional modification to correct abuse and adapt it to change of circumstance may i think be safely trust for the future there be in the management of such extensive interest much virtue in stability and although great and obvious improvement should not be decline change should never be make without the full examination and the clear demonstration of their practical utility in the history of the past we have an assurance that this safe rule of action will not be depart from in relation to the public land nor be it believe that any necessity exist for interfere with the fundamental principle of the system or that the public mind even in the new states be desirous of any radical alteration on the contrary the general disposition appear to be to make such modification and addition only as will the more effectually carry out the original policy of fill our new states and territories with an industrious and independent population the modification most perseveringly press upon congress which have occupy so much of its time for year past and will probably do so for a long time to come if not soon satisfactorily adjust be a reduction in the cost of such portion of the public land as be ascertain to be unsalable at the rate now establish by law and a graduation accord to their relative value of the price at which they may hereafter be sell it be worthy of consideration whether justice may not be do to every interest in this matter and a vex question set at rest perhaps forever by a reasonable compromise of conflict opinion hitherto after be offer at public sale land have be dispose of at one uniform price whatever difference there might be in their intrinsic value the lead consideration urge in favor of the measure refer to are that in almost all the land district and particularly in those in which the land have be long survey and expose to sale there be still remain numerous and large tract of every gradation of value from the government price downward that these land will not be purchase at the government price so long as well can be conveniently obtain for the same amount that there be large tract which even the improvement of the adjacent land will never raise to that price and that the present uniform price combine with their irregular value operate to prevent a desirable compactness of settlement in the new states and to retard the full development of that wise policy on which our land system be found to the injury not only of the several states where the land lie but of the united states as a whole the remedy propose have be a reduction of the price accord to the length of time the land have be in market without reference to any other circumstance the certainty that the efflux of time would not always in such case and perhaps not even generally furnish a true criterion of value and the probability that person reside in the vicinity as the period for the reduction of price approach would postpone purchase they would otherwise make for the purpose of avail themselves of the low price with other consideration of a similar character have hitherto be successfully urge to defeat the graduation upon time may not all reasonable desire upon this subject be satisfied without encounter any of these objection all will concede the abstract principle that the price of the public land should be proportion to their relative value so far as can be accomplish without depart from the rule heretofore observe require fix price in case of private entry the difficulty of the subject seem to lie in the mode of ascertain what that value be would not the safe plan be that which have be adopt by many of the states as the basis of taxation an actual valuation of land and classification of they into different rate would it not be practicable and expedient to cause the relative value of the public land in the old district which have be for a certain length of time in market to be appraise and class into two or more rate below the present minimum price by the officer now employ in this branch of the public service or in any other mode deem preferable and to make those price permanent if upon the come in of the report they shall prove satisfactory to congress could not all the object of graduation be accomplish in this way and the objection which have hitherto be urge against it avoid it would seem to i that such a step with a restriction of the sale to limited quantity and for actual improvement would be free from all just exception by the full exposition of the value of the land thus furnish and extensively promulgate person live at a distance would be inform of their true condition and enable to enter into competition with those reside in the vicinity the mean of acquire an independent home would be bring within the reach of many who be unable to purchase at present price the population of the new states would be make more compact and large tract would be sell which would otherwise remain on hand not only would the land be bring within the mean of a large number of purchaser but many person possess of great mean would be content to settle on a large quantity of the poor land rather than emigrate far west in pursuit of a small quantity of well land such a measure would also seem to be more consistent with the policy of the exist law that of convert the public domain into cultivate farm own by their occupant that policy be not well promote by send emigration up the almost interminable stream of the west to occupy in group the good spot of land leave immense waste behind they and enlarge the frontier beyond the mean of the government to afford it adequate protection but in encourage it to occupy with reasonable denseness the territory over which it advance and find its good defense in the compact front which it present to the indian tribe many of you will bring to the consideration of the subject the advantage of local knowledge and great experience and all will be desirous of make an early and final disposition of every disturbing question in regard to this important interest if these suggestion shall in any degree contribute to the accomplishment of so important a result it will afford i sincere satisfaction in some section of the country most of the public land have be sell and the register and receiver have very little to do it be a subject worthy of inquiry whether in many case two or more district may not be consolidate and the number of person employ in this business considerably reduce indeed the time will come when it will be the true policy of the general government as to some of the states to transfer to they for a reasonable equivalent all the refuse and unsold land and to withdraw the machinery of the federal land office altogether all who take a comprehensive view of our federal system and believe that one of its great excellency consist in interfere as little as possible with the internal concern of the states look forward with great interest to this result a modification of the exist law in respect to the price of the public land might also have a favorable influence on the legislation of congress in relation to another branch of the subject many who have not the ability to buy at present price settle on those land with the hope of acquire from their cultivation the mean of purchase under preemption law from time to time pass by congress for this encroachment on the right of the united states they excuse themselves under the plea of their own necessity the fact that they dispossess nobody and only enter upon the waste domain that they give additional value to the public land in their vicinity and their intention ultimately to pay the government price so much weight have from time to time be attach to these consideration that congress have pass law give actual settler on the public land a right of preemption to the tract occupy by they at the minimum price these law have in all instance be retrospective in their operation but in a few year after their passage crowd of new settler have be find on the public land for similar reason and under like expectation who have be indulge with the same privilege this course of legislation tend to impair public respect for the law of the country either the law to prevent intrusion upon the public land should be execute or if that should be impracticable or inexpedient they should be modify or repeal if the public land be to be consider as open to be occupy by any they should by law be throw open to all that which be intend in all instance to be legalized should at once be make legal that those who be disposed to conform to the law may enjoy at least equal privilege with those who be not but it be not believe to be the disposition of congress to open the public land to occupancy without regular entry and payment of the government price as such a course must tend to worse evil than the credit system which it be find necessary to abolish it would seem therefore to be the part of wisdom and sound policy to remove as far as practicable the cause which produce intrusion upon the public land and then take efficient step to prevent they in future would any single measure be so effective in remove all plausible ground for these intrusion as the graduation of price already suggest a short period of industry and economy in any part of our country would enable the poor citizen to accumulate the mean to buy he a home at the low price and leave he without apology for settle on land not his own if he do not under such circumstance he would enlist no sympathy in his favor and the law would be readily execute without do violence to public opinion a large portion of our citizen have seat themselves on the public land without authority since the passage of the last preemption law and now ask the enactment of another to enable they to retain the land occupy upon payment of the minimum government price they ask that which have be repeatedly grant before if the future may be judge of by the past little harm can be do to the interest of the treasury by yield to their request upon a critical examination it be find that the land sell at the public sale since the introduction of cash payment in 1820 have produce on an average the net revenue of only 6 cent an acre more than the minimum government price there be no reason to suppose that future sale will be more productive the government therefore have no adequate pecuniary interest to induce it to drive these people from the land they occupy for the purpose of sell they to other entertain these view i recommend the passage of a preemption law for their benefit in connection with the preparatory step toward the graduation of the price of the public land and far and more effectual provision to prevent intrusion hereafter indulgence to those who have settle on these land with expectation that past legislation would be make a rule for the future and at the same time remove the most plausible ground on which intrusion be excuse and adopt more efficient mean to prevent they hereafter appear to i the most judicious disposition which can be make of this difficult subject the limitation and restriction to guard against abuse in the execution of a preemption law will necessarily attract the careful attention of congress but under no circumstance be it consider expedient to authorize float claim in any shape they have be heretofore and doubtless would be hereafter most prolific source of fraud and oppression and instead of operate to confer the favor of the government on industrious settler be often use only to minister to a spirit of cupidity at the expense of the most meritorious of that class the accompanying report of the secretary of war will bring to your view the state of the army and all the various subject confide to the superintendence of that officer the principal part of the army have be concentrate in florida with a view and in the expectation of bring the war in that territory to a speedy close the necessity of strip the post on the maritime and inland frontier of their entire garrison for the purpose of assemble in the field an army of less than 4,000 man would seem to indicate the necessity of increase our regular force and the superior efficiency as well as greatly diminish expense of that description of troop recommend this measure as one of economy as well as of expediency i refer to the report for the reason which have induce the secretary of war to urge the reorganization and enlargement of the staff of the army and of the ordnance corps in which i fully concur it be not however compatible with the interest of the people to maintain in time of peace a regular force adequate to the defense of our extensive frontier in period of danger and alarm we must rely principally upon a well organize militia and some general arrangement that will render this description of force more efficient have long be a subject of anxious solicitude it be recommend to the first congress by general washington and have be since frequently bring to your notice and recently its importance strongly urge by my immediate predecessor the provision in the constitution that render it necessary to adopt a uniform system of organization for the militia throughout the united states present an insurmountable obstacle to an efficient arrangement by the classification heretofore propose and i invite your attention to the plan which will be submit by the secretary of war for the organization of volunteer corp and the instruction of militia officer as more simple and practicable if not equally advantageous as a general arrangement of the whole militia of the united states a moderate increase of the corps both of military and topographical engineer have be more than once recommend by my predecessor and my conviction of the propriety not to say necessity of the measure in order to enable they to perform the various and important duty impose upon they induce i to repeat the recommendation the military academy continue to answer all the purpose of its establishment and not only furnish well educate officer to the army but serve to diffuse throughout the mass of our citizen individual possess of military knowledge and the scientific attainment of civil and military engineering at present the cadet be bind with consent of his parent or guardian to remain in service five year from the period of his enlistment unless soon discharge thus exact only one year 's service in the army after his education be complete this do not appear to i sufficient government ought to command for a long period the service of those who be educate at the public expense and i recommend that the time of enlistment be extend to seven year and the term of the engagement strictly enforce the creation of a national foundry for cannon to be common to the service of the army and navy of the united states have be heretofore recommend and appear to be require in order to place our ordnance on an equal footing with that of other country and to enable that branch of the service to control the price of those article and graduate the supply to the want of the government as well as to regulate their quality and insure their uniformity the same reason induce i to recommend the erection of a manufactory of gunpowder to be under the direction of the ordnance office the establishment of a manufactory of small arm west of the alleghany mountains upon the plan propose by the secretary of war will contribute to extend throughout that country the improvement which exist in establishment of a similar description in the atlantic states and tend to a much more economical distribution of the armament require in the western portion of our union the system of remove the indians west of the mississippi commence by mr. jefferson in 1804 have be steadily persevere in by every succeed president and may be consider the settle policy of the country unconnected at first with any well define system for their improvement the inducement hold out to the indians be confine to the great abundance of game to be find in the west but when the beneficial effect of their removal be make apparent a more philanthropic and enlightened policy be adopt in purchase their land east of the mississippi liberal price be give and provision insert in all the treaty with they for the application of the fund they receive in exchange to such purpose as be well calculate to promote their present welfare and advance their future civilization these measure have be attend thus far with the happy result it will be see by refer to the report of the commissioner of indian affairs that the most sanguine expectation of the friend and promoter of this system have be realize the choctaws cherokees and other tribe that first emigrate beyond the mississippi have for the most part abandon the hunter state and become cultivator of the soil the improvement in their condition have be rapid and it be believe that they be now fit to enjoy the advantage of a simple form of government which have be submit to they and receive their sanction and i can not too strongly urge this subject upon the attention of congress stipulation have be make with all the indian tribe to remove they beyond the mississippi except with the band of the wyandots the six nations in new york the menomonees munsees and stockbridges in wisconsin and miamies in indiana with all but the menomonees it be expect that arrangement for their emigration will be complete the present year the resistance which have be oppose to their removal by some of the tribe even after treaty have be make with they to that effect have arise from various cause operate differently on each of they in most instance they have be instigate to resistance by person to whom the trade with they and the acquisition of their annuity be important and in some by the personal influence of interested chief these obstacle must be overcome for the government can not relinquish the execution of this policy without sacrifice important interest and abandon the tribe remain east of the mississippi to certain destruction the decrease in number of the tribe within the limit of the states and territories have be most rapid if they be remove they can be protect from those association and evil practice which exert so pernicious and destructive an influence over their destiny they can be induce to labor and to acquire property and its acquisition will inspire they with a feeling of independence their mind can be cultivate and they can be teach the value of salutary and uniform law and be make sensible of the blessing of free government and capable of enjoy its advantage in the possession of property knowledge and a good government free to give what direction they please to their labor and sharer in the legislation by which their person and the profit of their industry be to be protect and secure they will have an ever present

advantage to that harbor and add greatly to its value as a naval station the accurate survey of georges shoals off the coast of massachusetts lately complete will render comparatively safe a navigation hitherto consider dangerous considerable addition have be make to the number of captain commander lieutenant surgeon and assistant surgeon in the navy these addition be render necessary by the increase number of vessel put in commission to answer the exigency of our grow commerce your attention be respectfully invite to the various suggestion of the secretary for the improvement of the naval service the report of the postmaster general exhibit the progress and condition of the mail service the operation of the post office department constitute one of the most active element of our national prosperity and it be gratify to observe with what vigor they be conduct the mail route of the united states cover an extent of about 142,877 mile having be increase about 37,103 mile within the last two year the annual mail transportation on these route be about 36,228,962 mile having be increase about 10,359,476 mile within the same period the number of post office have also be increase from 10,770 to 12,099 very few of which receive the mail less than once a week and a large portion of they daily contractor and postmaster in general be represent as attend to their duty with most commendable zeal and fidelity the revenue of the department within the year end on the 30th of june last be $ 4,137,056.59 and its liability accrue within the same time be $ 3,380,847.75 the increase of revenue over that of the precede year be $ 708,166.41 for many interesting detail i refer you to the report of the postmaster general with the accompany paper your particular attention be invite to the necessity of provide a more safe and convenient building for the accommodation of that department i lie before congress copy of report submit in pursuance of a call make by i upon the head of departments for such suggestion as their experience might enable they to make as to what further legislative provision may be advantageously adopt to secure the faithful application of public money to the object for which they be appropriate to prevent their misapplication or embezzlement by those intrust with the expenditure of they and generally to increase the security of the government against loss in their disbursement it be needless to dilate on the importance of provide such new safeguard as be within the power of legislation to promote these end and i have little to add to the recommendation submit in the accompany paper by law the term of service of our most important collecting and disbursing officer in the civil department be limit to four year and when reappointe their bond be require to be renew the safety of the public be much increase by this feature of the law and there can be no doubt that its application to all officer intrust with the collection or disbursement of the public money whatever may be the tenure of their office would be equally beneficial i therefore recommend in addition to such of the suggestion present by the head of departments as you may think useful a general provision that all officer of the army or navy or in the civil department intrust with the receipt or payment of public money and whose term of service be either unlimited or for a long time than four year be require to give new bond with good and sufficient surety at the expiration of every such period a change in the period of terminate the fiscal year from the 1st of october to the 1st of april have be frequently recommend and appear to be desirable the distressing casualty in steamboat which have so frequently happen during the year seem to evince the necessity of attempt to prevent they by mean of severe provision connect with their customhouse paper this subject be submit to the attention of congress by the secretary of the treasury in his last annual report and will be again notice at the present session with additional detail it will doubtless receive that early and careful consideration which its press importance appear to require your attention have heretofore be frequently call to the affair of the district of columbia and i should not again ask it do not their entire dependence on congress give they a constant claim upon its notice separate by the constitution from the rest of the union limit in extent and aid by no legislature of its own it would seem to be a spot where a wise and uniform system of local government might have be easily adopt this district have however unfortunately be leave to linger behind the rest of the union its code civil and criminal be not only very defective but full of obsolete or inconvenient provision be form of portion of two states discrepancie in the law prevail in different part of the territory small as it be and although it be select as the seat of the general government the site of its public edifice the depository of its archive and the residence of officer intrust with large amount of public property and the management of public business yet it have never be subject to or receive that special and comprehensive legislation which these circumstance peculiarly demand i be well aware of the various subject of great magnitude and immediate interest that press themselves on the consideration of congress but i believe there be not one that appeal more directly to its justice than a liberal and even generous attention to the interest of the district of columbia and a thorough and careful revision of its local government

other in the acknowledge practical and unlimited operation which it have for so long a period give to the sovereignty of the people have now be fully test by experience the constitution devise by our forefather as the framework and bond of that system then untried have become a settle form of government not only preserve and protect the great principle upon which it be rounded but wonderfully promote individual happiness and private interest though subject to change and entire revocation whenever deem inadequate to all these purpose yet such be the wisdom of its construction and so stable have be the public sentiment that it remain unaltered except in matter of detail comparatively unimportant it have prove amply sufficient for the various emergency incident to our condition as a nation a formidable foreign war agitate collision between domestic and in some respect rival sovereignty temptation to interfere in the intestine commotion of neighboring country the dangerous influence that arise in period of excessive prosperity and the antirepublican tendency of associate wealth these with other trial not less formidable have all be encounter and thus far successfully resist it be reserve for the american union to test the advantage of a government entirely dependent on the continual exercise of the popular will and our experience have show that it be as beneficent in practice as it be just in theory each successive change make in our local institution have contribute to extend the right of suffrage have increase the direct influence of the mass of the community give great freedom to individual exertion and restrict more and more the power of government yet the intelligence prudence and patriotism of the people have keep pace with this augmented responsibility in no country have education be so widely diffused domestic peace have nowhere so largely reign the close bond of social intercourse have in no instance prevail with such harmony over a space so vast all form of religion have unite for the first time to diffuse charity and piety because for the first time in the history of nation all have be totally untrammeled and absolutely free the deep recess of the wilderness have be penetrate yet instead of the rudeness in the social condition consequent upon such adventure elsewhere numerous community have spring up already unrivale in prosperity general intelligence internal tranquillity and the wisdom of their political institution internal improvement the fruit of individual enterprise foster by the protection of the states have add new link to the confederation and fresh reward to provident industry doubtful question of domestic policy have be quietly settle by mutual forbearance and agriculture commerce and manufacture

evident and successful we owe that increase attachment to they which be among the most cheering exhibition of popular sentiment and will prove their good security in time to come against foreign or domestic assault this review of the result of our institution for half a century without exciting a spirit of vain exultation should serve to impress upon we the great principle from which they have spring constant and direct supervision by the people over every public measure strict forbearance on the part of the government from exercise any doubtful or disputed power and a cautious abstinence from all interference with concern which properly belong and be well leave to state regulation and individual enterprise full information of the state of our foreign affair having be recently on different occasion submit to congress i deem it necessary now to bring to your notice only such event as have subsequently occur or be of such importance as to require particular attention the most amicable disposition continue to be exhibit by all the nation with whom the government and citizen of the united states have an habitual intercourse at the date of my last annual message mexico be the only nation which could not be include in so gratify a reference to our foreign relation i be happy to be now able to inform you that an advance have be make toward the adjustment of our difference with that republic and the restoration of the customary good feeling between the two nation this important change have be effect by conciliatory negotiation that have result in the conclusion of a treaty between the two government which when ratify will refer to the arbitrament of a friendly power all the subject of controversy between we grow out of injury to individual there be at present also reason to believe that an equitable settlement of all dispute point will be attain without further difficulty or unnecessary delay and thus authorize the free resumption of diplomatic intercourse with our sister republic with respect to the northeastern boundary of the united states no official correspondence between this government and that of great britain have pass since that communicate to congress toward the close of their last session the offer to negotiate a convention for the appointment of a joint commission of survey and exploration i be however assured will be meet by her majesty 's government in a conciliatory and friendly spirit and instruction to enable the british minister here to conclude such an arrangement will be transmit to he without needless delay it be hope and expect that these instruction will be of a liberal character and that this negotiation if successful will prove to be an important step toward the satisfactory and final adjustment of the controversy i have hope that the respect for the law and regard for the peace and honor of their own country which have ever characterize the citizen of the united states would have prevent any portion of they from use any mean to promote insurrection in the territory of a power with which we be at peace and with which the united states be desirous of maintain the most friendly relation i regret deeply however to be oblige to inform you that this have not be the case information have be give to i derive from official and other source that many citizen of the united states have associate together to make hostile incursion from our territory into canada and to aid and abet insurrection there in violation of the obligation and law of the united states and in open disregard of their own duty as citizen this information have be in part confirm by a hostile invasion actually make by citizen of the united states in conjunction with canadians and other and accompany by a forcible seizure of the property of our citizen and an application thereof to the prosecution of military operation against the authority and people of canada the result of these criminal assault upon the peace and order of a neighboring country have be as be to be expect fatally destructive to the misguided or deluded person engage in they and highly injurious to those in whose behalf they be profess to have be undertake the authority in canada from intelligence receive of such intended movement among our citizen have feel themselves oblige to take precautionary measure against they have actually embody the militia and assume an attitude to repel the invasion to which they believe the colony be expose from the united states a state of feeling on both side of the frontier have thus be produce which call for prompt and vigorous interference if an insurrection exist in canada the amicable disposition of the united states toward great britain as well as their duty to themselves would lead they to maintain a strict neutrality and to restrain their citizen from all violation of the law which have be pass for its enforcement but this government recognize a still high obligation to repress all attempt on the part of its citizen to disturb the peace of a country where order prevail or have be reestablish depredation by our citizen upon nation at peace with the united states or combination for commit they have at all time be regard by the american government and people with the great abhorrence military incursion by our citizen into country so situated and the commission of act of violence on the member thereof in order to effect a change in their government or under any pretext whatever have from the commencement of our government be hold equally criminal on the part of those engage in they and as much deserve of punishment as would be the disturbance of the public peace by the perpetration of similar act within our own territory by no country or person have these invaluable principle of international law principle the strict observance of which be so indispensable to the preservation of social order in the world be more earnestly cherished or sacredly respect than by those great and good man who first declare and finally establish the independence of our own country they promulgate and maintain they at an early and critical period in our history they be subsequently embody in legislative enactment of a highly penal character the faithful enforcement of which have hitherto be and will i trust always continue to be regard as a duty inseparably associate with the maintenance of our national honor that the people of the united states should feel an interest in the spread of political institution as free as they regard their own to be be natural nor can a sincere solicitude for the success of all those who be at any time in good faith struggle for their acquisition be impute to our citizen as a crime with the entire freedom of opinion and an undisguised expression thereof on their part the government have neither the right nor i trust the disposition to interfere but whether the interest or the honor of the united states require that they should be make a party to any such struggle and by inevitable consequence to the war which be wage in its support be a question which by our constitution be wisely leave to congress alone to decide it be by the law already make criminal in our citizen to embarrass or anticipate that decision by unauthorized military operation on their part offense of this character in addition to their criminality as violation of the law of our country have a direct tendency to draw down upon our own citizen at large the multiplied evil of a foreign war and expose to injurious imputation the good faith and honor of the country as such they deserve to be put down with promptitude and decision i can not be mistaken i be confident in count on the cordial and general concurrence of our fellow citizen in this sentiment a copy of the proclamation which i have feel it my duty to issue be herewith communicate i can not but hope that the good sense and patriotism the regard for the honor and reputation of their country the respect for the law which they have themselves enact for their own government and the love of order for which the mass of our people have be so long and so justly distinguished will deter the comparatively few who be engage in they from a further prosecution of such desperate enterprise in the meantime the exist law have be and will continue to be faithfully execute and every effort will be make to carry they out in their full extent whether they be sufficient or not to meet the actual state of thing on the canadian frontier it be for congress to decide it will appear from the correspondence herewith submit that the government of russia decline a renewal of the fourth article of the convention of april 1824 between the united states and his imperial majesty by the third article of which it be agree that hereafter there shall not be form by the citizen of the united states or under the authority of the say states any establishment upon the northwest coast of america nor in any of the island adjacent to the north of 54 40 of north latitude and that in the same manner there shall be none form by russian subject or under the authority of russia south of the same parallel and by the fourth article that during a term of ten year count from the signature of the present convention the ship of both power or which belong to their citizen or subject respectively may reciprocally frequent without any hindrance whatever the interior sea gulfs harbor and creek upon the coast mention in the precede article for the purpose of fishing and trading with the native of the country the reason assign for decline to renew the provision of this article be briefly that the only use make by our citizen of the privilege it secure to they have be to supply the indians with spirituous liquor ammunition and firearm that this traffic have be exclude from the russian trade and as the supply furnish from the united states be injurious to the russian establishment on the northw coast and calculate to produce complaint between the two government his imperial majesty think it for the interest of both country not to accede to the proposition make by the american government for the renewal of the article last refer to the correspondence herewith communicate will show the ground upon which we contend that the citizen of the united states have independent of the provision of the convention of 1824 a right to trade with the native upon the coast in question at unoccupied place liable however it be admit to be at any time extinguish by the creation of russian establishment at such point this right be deny by the russian government which assert that by the operation of the treaty of 1824 each party agree to waive the general right to land on the vacant coast on the respective side of the degree of latitude refer to and accept in lieu thereof the mutual privilege mention in the fourth article the capital and tonnage employ by our citizen in their trade with the northw coast of america will perhaps on advert to the official statement of the commerce and navigation of the united states for the last few year be deem too inconsiderable in amount to attract much attention yet the subject may in other respect deserve the careful consideration of congress i regret to state that the blockade of the principal port on the eastern coast of mexico which in consequence of difference between that republic and france be institute in may last unfortunately still continue enforce by a competent french naval armament and be necessarily embarrass to our own trade in the gulf in common with that of other nation every disposition however be believe to exist on the part of the french government to render this measure as little onerous as practicable to the interest of the citizen of the united states and to those of neutral commerce and it be to be hope that an early settlement of the difficulty between france and mexico will soon reestablish the harmonious relation formerly subsist between they and again open the port of that republic to the vessel of all friendly nation a convention for mark that part of the boundary between the united states and the republic of texas which extend from the mouth of the sabine to the red river be conclude and sign at this city on the 25th of april last it have since be ratify by both government and seasonable measure will be take to carry it into effect on the part of the united states the application of that republic for admission into this union make in august 1837 and which be decline for reason already make known to you have be formally withdraw as will appear from the accompany copy of the note of the minister plenipotentiary of texas which be present to the secretary of state on the occasion of the exchange of the ratification of the convention above mention copy of the convention with texas of a commercial treaty conclude with the king of greece and of a similar treaty with the peru bolivian confederation the ratification of which have be recently exchange accompany this message for the information of congress and for such legislative enactment as may be find necessary or expedient in relation to either of they to watch over and foster the interest of a gradually increase and widely extended commerce to guard the right of american citizen whom business or pleasure or other motive may tempt into distant clime and at the same time to cultivate those sentiment of mutual respect and good will which experience have prove so beneficial in international intercourse the government of the united states have deem it expedient from time to time to establish diplomatic connection with different foreign state by the appointment of representative to reside within their respective territory i be gratified to be enable to announce to you that since the close of your last session these relation have be open under the happy auspex with austria and the two sicilies that new nomination have be make in the respective mission of russia brazil belgium and sweden and norway in this country and that a minister extraordinary have be receive accredit to this government from the argentine confederation an exposition of the fiscal affair of the government and of their condition for the past year will be make to you by the secretary of the treasury the available balance in the treasury on the 1st of january next be estimate at $ 2,765,342 the receipt of the year from custom and land will probably amount to $ 20,615,598 these usual source of revenue have be increase by an issue of treasury note of which less than $ 8,000,000 include interest and principal will be outstanding at the end of the year and by the sale of one of the bond of the bank of the united states for $ 2,254,871 the aggregate of mean from these and other source with the balance on hand on the 1st of january last have be apply to the payment of appropriation by congress the whole expenditure for the year on their account include the redemption of more than eight million of treasury note constitute an aggregate of about $ 40,000,000 and will still leave in the treasury the balance before state nearly $ 8,000,000 of treasury note be to be pay during the come year in addition to the ordinary appropriation for the support of government for both these purpose the resource of the treasury will undoubtedly be sufficient if the charge upon it be not increase beyond the annual estimate no excess however be likely to exist nor can the postpone installment of the surplus revenue be deposit with the states nor any considerable appropriation beyond the estimate be make without cause a deficiency in the treasury the great caution advisable at all time of limit appropriation to the want of the public service be render necessary at present by the prospective and rapid reduction of the tariff while the vigilant jealousy evidently excited among the people by the occurrence of the last few year assure we that they expect from their representative and will sustain they in the exercise of the most rigid economy much can be effect by postpone appropriation not immediately require for the ordinary public service or for any press emergency and much by reduce the expenditure where the entire and immediate accomplishment of the object in view be not indispensable when we call to mind the recent and extreme embarrassment produce by excessive issue of bank paper aggravate by the unforeseen withdrawal of much foreign capital and the inevitable derangement arise from the distribution of the surplus revenue among the states as require by congress and consider the heavy expense incur by the removal of indian tribe by the military operation in florida and on account of the unusually large appropriation make at the last two annual session of congress for other object we have strike evidence in the present efficient state of our finance of the abundant resource of the country to fulfill all its obligation nor be it less gratifying to find that the general business of the community deeply affect as it have be be revive with additional vigor chasten by the lesson of the past and animate by the hope of the future by the curtailment of paper issue by curb the sanguine and adventurous spirit of speculation and by the honorable application of all available mean to the fulfillment of obligation confidence have be restore both at home and abroad and ease and facility secure to all the operation of trade the agency of the government in produce these result have be as efficient as its power and mean permit by withhold from the states the deposit of the fourth installment and leave several million at long credit with the bank principally in one section of the country and more immediately beneficial to it and at the same time aid the bank and commercial community in other section by postpone the payment of bond for duty to the amount of between four and five million of dollar by an issue of treasury note as a means to enable the government to meet the consequence of their indulgence but afford at the same time facility for remittance and exchange and by steadily decline to employ as general depository of the public revenue or receive the note of all bank which refuse to redeem they with specie by these measure aid by the favorable action of some of the bank and by the support and cooperation of a large portion of the community we have witness an early resumption of specie payment in our great commercial capital promptly follow in almost every part of the united states this result have be alike salutary to the true interest of agriculture commerce and manufacture to public moral respect for the law and that confidence between man and man which be so essential in all our social relation the contrast between the suspension of 1814 and that of 1837 be most striking the short duration of the latter the prompt restoration of business the evident benefit result from an adherence by the government to the constitutional standard of value instead of sanction the suspension by the receipt of irredeemable paper and the advantage derive from the large amount of specie introduce into the country previous to 1837 afford a valuable illustration of the true policy of the government in such a crisis nor can the comparison fail to remove the impression that a national bank be necessary in such emergency not only be specie payment resume without its aid but exchange have also be more rapidly restore than when it exist thereby show that private capital enterprise and prudence be fully adequate to these end on all these point experience seem to have confirm the view heretofore submit to congress we have be save the mortification of see the distress of the community for the third time seize on to fasten upon the country so dangerous an institution and we may also hope that the business of individual will hereafter be relieve from the injurious effect of a continue agitation of that disturbing subject the limited influence of a national bank in avert derangement in the exchange of the country or in compelling the resumption of specie payment be now not less apparent than its tendency to increase inordinate speculation by sudden expansion and contraction its disposition to create panic and embarrassment for the promotion of its own design its interference with politic and its far great power for evil than for good either in regard to the local institution or the operation of government itself what be in these respect but apprehension or opinion when a national bank be first establish now stand confirm by humiliating experience the scene through which we have pass conclusively prove how little our commerce agriculture manufacture or finance require such an institution and what danger be attendant on its power a power i trust never to be confer by the american people upon their government and still less upon individual not responsible to they for its unavoidable abuse my conviction of the necessity of further legislative provision for the safe keeping and disbursement of the public money and my opinion in regard to the measure well adapt to the accomplishment of those object have be already submit to you these have be strengthen by recent event and in the full conviction that time and experience must still far demonstrate their propriety i feel it my duty with respectful deference to the conflict view of other again to invite your attention to they with the exception of limited sum deposit in the few bank still employ under the act of 1836 the amount receive for duty and with very inconsiderable exception those accrue from land also have since the general suspension of specie payment by the deposit bank be keep and disburse by the treasurer under his general legal power subject to the superintendence of the secretary of the treasury the propriety of define more specifically and of regulate by law the exercise of this wide scope of executive discretion have be already submit to congress a change in the office of collector at one of our principal port have bring to light a defalcation of the grave character the particular of which will be lay before you in a special report from the secretary of the treasury by his report and the accompany document it will be see that the weekly return of the default officer apparently exhibit throughout a faithful administration of the affair intrust to his management it however now appear that he commence abstract the public money shortly after his appointment and continue to do so progressively increase the amount for the term of more than seven year embrace a portion of the period during which the public money be deposit in the bank of the united states the whole of that of the state bank deposit system and conclude only on his retirement from office after that system have substantially fail in consequence of the suspension of specie payment the way in which this defalcation be so long conceal and the step take to indemnify the united states as far as practicable against loss will also be present to you the ease be one which imperatively claim the attention of congress and furnish the strong motive for the establishment of a more severe and secure system for the safe keep -and disbursement of the public money than any that have heretofore exist it seem proper at all event that by an early enactment similar to that of other country the application of public money by an officer of government to private use should be make a felony and visit with severe and ignominious punishment this be already in effect the law in respect to the mint and have be productive of the most salutary result whatever system be adopt such an enactment would be wise as an independent measure since much of the public money must in their collection and ultimate disbursement pass twice through the hand of public officer in whatever manner they be intermediately keep the government it must be admit have be from its commencement comparatively fortunate in this respect but the appoint power can not always be well advise in its selection and the experience of every country have show that public officer be not at all time proof against temptation it be a duty therefore which the government owe as well to the interest commit to its care as to the officer themselves to provide every guard against transgression of this character that be consistent with reason and humanity congress can not be too jealous of the conduct of those who be intrust with the public money and i shall at all time be disposed to encourage a watchful discharge of this duty if a more direct cooperation on the part of congress in the supervision of the conduct of the officer intrust with the custody and application of the public money be deem desirable it will give i pleasure to assist in the establishment of any judicious and constitutional plan by which that object may be accomplish you will in your wisdom determine upon the propriety of adopt such a plan and upon the measure necessary to its effectual execution when the late bank of the united states be incorporate and make the depository of the public money a right be reserve to congress to inspect at its pleasure by a committee of that body the book and the proceeding of the bank in one of the states whose banking institution be suppose to rank amongst the first in point of stability they be subject to constant examination by commissioner appoint for that purpose and much of the success of its banking system be attribute to this watchful supervision the same course have also in view of its beneficial operation be adopt by an adjoining state favorably know for the care it have always bestow upon whatever relate to its financial concern i submit to your consideration whether a committee of congress might not be profitably employ in inspect at such interval as might be deem proper the affair and account of officer intrust with the custody of the public money the frequent performance of this duty might be make obligatory on the committee in respect to those officer who have large sum in their possession and leave discretionary in respect to other they might report to the executive such defalcation as be find to exist with a view to a prompt removal from office unless the default be satisfactorily account for and report also to congress at the commencement of each session the result of their examination and proceeding it do appear to i that with a subjection of this class of public officer to the general supervision of the executive to examination by a committee of congress at period of which they should have no previous notice and to prosecution and punishment as for felony for every breach of trust the safe keeping of the public money might under the system propose be place on a surer foundation than it have ever occupy since the establishment of the government the secretary of the treasury will lay before you additional information contain new detail on this interesting subject to these i ask your early attention that it should have give rise to great diversity of opinion can not be a subject of surprise after the collection and custody of the public money have be for so many year connect with and make subsidiary to the advancement of private interest a return to the simple self deny ordinance of the constitution could not but be difficult but time and free discussion elicit the sentiment of the people and aid by that conciliatory spirit which have ever characterize their course on great emergency be rely upon for a satisfactory settlement of the question already have this anticipation on one important point at least the impropriety of divert public money to private purpose be fully realize there be no reason to suppose that legislation upon that branch of the subject would now be embarrass by a difference of opinion or fail to receive the cordial support of a large majority of our constituent the connection which formerly exist between the government and bank be in reality injurious to both as well as to the general interest of the community at large it aggravate the disaster of trade and the derangement of commercial intercourse and administer new excitement and additional mean to wild and reckless speculation the disappointment of which throw the country into convulsion of panic and all but produce violence and bloodshed the imprudent expansion of bank credit which be the natural result of the command of the revenue of the state furnish the resource for unbounded license in every specie of adventure seduce industry from its regular and salutary occupation by the hope of abundance without labor and derange the social state by tempt all trade and profession into the vortex of speculation on remote contingency the same wide spread influence impede also the resource of the government curtail its useful operation embarrass the fulfillment of its obligation and seriously interfere with the execution of the law large appropriation and oppressive taxis be the natural consequence of such a connection since they increase the profit of those who be allow to use the public fund and make it their interest that money should be accumulate and expenditure multiply it be thus that a concentrated money power be tempt to become an active agent in political affair and all past experience have show on which side that influence will be array we deceive ourselves if we suppose that it will ever be find assert and support the right of the community at large in opposition to the claim of the few in a government whose distinguish characteristic should be a diffusion and equalization of its benefit and burden the advantage of individual will be augment at the expense of the community at large nor be it the nature of combination for the acquisition of legislative influence to confine their interference to the single object for which they be originally form the temptation to extend it to other matter be on the contrary not unfrequently too strong to be resist the rightful influence in the direction of public affair of the mass of the people be therefore in no slight danger of be sensibly and injuriously affect by give to a comparatively small but very efficient class a direct and exclusive personal interest in so important a portion of the legislation of congress as that which relate to the custody of the public money if law act upon private interest can not always be avoid they should be confine within the narrow limit and leave wherever possible to the legislature of the states when not thus restrict they lead to combination of powerful association foster an influence necessarily selfish and turn the fair course of legislation to sinister end rather than to object that advance public liberty and promote the general good the whole subject now rest with you and i can not but express a hope that some definite measure will be adopt at the present session it will not i be sure be deem out of place for i here to remark that the declaration of my view in opposition to the policy of employ bank as depository of the government fund can not justly be construe as indicative of hostility official or personal to those institution or to repeat in this form and in connection with this subject opinion which i have uniformly entertain and on all proper occasion express though always oppose to their creation in the form of exclusive privilege and as a state magistrate aim by appropriate legislation to secure the community against the consequence of their occasional mismanagement i have yet ever wish to see they protect in the exercise of right confer by law and have never doubt their utility when properly manage in promote the interest of trade and through that channel the other interest of the community to the general government they present themselves merely as state institution have no necessary connection with its legislation or its administration like other state establishment they may be use or not in conduct the affair of the government as public policy and the general interest of the union may seem to require the only safe or proper principle upon which their intercourse with the government can be regulate be that which regulate their intercourse with the private citizen the conferring of mutual benefit when the government can accomplish a financial operation well with the aid of the bank than without it it should be at liberty to seek that aid as it would the service of a private banker or other capitalist or agent give the preference to those who will serve it on the good term nor can there ever exist an interest in the officer of the general government as such induce they to embarrass or annoy the state bank any more than to incur the hostility of any other class of state institution or of private citizen it be not in the nature of thing that hostility to these institution can spring from this source or any opposition to their course of business except when they themselves depart from the object of their creation and attempt to usurp power not confer upon they or to subvert the standard of value establish by the constitution while opposition to their regular operation can not exist in this quarter resistance to any attempt to make the government dependent upon they for the successful administration of public affair be a matter of duty as i trust it ever will be of inclination no matter from what motive or consideration the attempt may originate it be no more than just to the bank to say that in the late emergency most of they firmly resist the strong temptation to extend their paper issue when apparently sustain in a suspension of specie payment by public opinion even though in some case invite by legislative enactment to this honorable course aid by the resistance of the general government act in obedience to the constitution and law of the united states to the introduction of an irredeemable paper medium may be attribute in a great degree the speedy restoration of our currency to a sound state and the business of the country to its wonte prosperity the bank have but to continue in the same safe course and be content in their appropriate sphere to avoid all interference from the general government and to derive from it all the protection and benefit which it bestow on other state establishment on the people of the states and on the states themselves in this their true position they can not but secure the confidence and good will of the people and the government which they can only lose when leap from their legitimate sphere they attempt to control the legislation of the country and pervert the operation of the government to their own purpose our experience under the act pass at the last session to grant preemption right to settler on the public land have as yet be too limited to enable we to pronounce with safety upon the efficacy of its provision to carry out the wise and liberal policy of the government in that respect there be however the good reason to anticipate favorable result from its operation the recommendation formerly submit to you in respect to a graduation of the price of the public land remain to be finally act upon having find no reason to change the view then express your attention to they be again respectfully request every proper exertion have be make and will be continue to carry out the wish of congress in relation to the tobacco trade as indicate in the several resolution of the house of representatives and the legislation of the two branch a favorable impression have i trust be make in the different foreign country to which particular attention have be direct and although we can not hope for an early change in their policy as in many of they a convenient and large revenue be derive from monopoly in the fabrication and sale of this article yet as these monopoly be really injurious to the people where they be establish and the revenue derive from they may be less injuriously and with equal facility obtain from another and a liberal system of administration we can not doubt that our effort will be eventually crown with success if persist in with temperate firmness and sustain by prudent legislation in recommend to congress the adoption of the necessary provision at this session for take the next census or enumeration of the inhabitant of the united states the suggestion present itself whether the scope of the measure might not be usefully extend by cause it to embrace authentic statistical return of the great interest specially intrust to or necessarily affect by the legislation of congress the accompanying report of the secretary of war present a satisfactory account of the state of the army and of the several branch of the public service confide to the superintendence of that officer the law increase and organize the military establishment of the united states have be nearly carry into effect and the army have be extensively and usefully employ during the past season i would again call to your notice the subject connect with and essential to the military defense of the country which be submit to you at the last session but which be not act upon as be suppose for want of time the most important of they be the organization of the militia on the maritime and inland frontier this measure be deem important as it be believe that it will furnish an effective volunteer force in aid of the regular army and may form the basis of a general system of organization for the entire militia of the united states the erection of a national foundry and gunpowder manufactory and one for make small arm the latter to be situate at some point west of the allegany mountains all appear to be of sufficient importance to be again urge upon your attention the plan propose by the secretary of war for the distribution of the force of the united states in time of peace be well calculate to promote regularity and economy in the fiscal administration of the service to preserve the discipline of the troop and to render they available for the maintenance of the peace and tranquillity of the country with this view likewise i recommend the adoption of the plan present by that officer for the defense of the western frontier the preservation of the life and property of our fellow citizen who be settle upon that border country as well as the existence of the indian population which might be tempt by our want of preparation to rush on their own destruction and attack the white settlement all seem to require that this subject should be act upon without delay and the war department authorize to place that country in a state of complete defense against any assault from the numerous and warlike tribe which be congregate on that border it afford i sincere pleasure to be able to apprise you of the entire removal of the cherokee nation of indians to their new home west of the mississippi the measure authorize by congress at its last session with a view to the long stand controversy with they have have the happy effect by an agreement conclude with they by the command general in that country who have perform the duty assign to he on the occasion with commendable energy and humanity their removal have be principally under the conduct of their own chief and they have emigrate without any apparent reluctance the successful accomplishment of this important object the removal also of the entire creek nation with the exception of a small number of fugitive amongst the seminoles in florida the progress already make toward a speedy completion of the removal of the chickasaws the choctaws the pottawatamies the ottawas and the chippewas with the extensive purchase of indian land during the present year have render the speedy and successful result of the long establish policy of the government upon the subject of indian affair entirely certain the occasion be therefore deem a proper one to place this policy in such a point of view as will exonerate the government of the united states from the undeserved reproach which have be cast upon it through several successive administration that a mixed occupancy of the same territory by the white and red man be incompatible with the safety or happiness of either be a position in respect to which there have long since cease to be room for a difference of opinion reason and experience have alike demonstrate its impracticability the bitter fruit of every attempt heretofore to overcome the barrier interpose by nature have only be destruction both physical and moral to the indian dangerous conflict of authority between the federal and state government and detriment to the individual prosperity of the citizen as well as to the general improvement of the country the remedial policy the principle of which be settle more than thirty year ago under the administration of mr. jefferson consist in an extinction for a fair consideration of the title to all the land still occupy by the indians within the states and territories of the united states their removal to a country west of the mississippi much more extensive and well adapt to their condition than that on which they then reside the guarantee to they by the united states of their exclusive possession of that country forever exempt from all intrusion by white man with ample provision for their security against external violence and internal dissension and the extension to they of suitable facility for their advancement in civilization this have not be the policy of particular administration only but of each in succession since the first attempt to carry it out under that of mr. monroe all have labor for its accomplishment only with different degree of success the manner of its execution have it be true from time to time give rise to conflict of opinion and unjust imputation but in respect to the wisdom and necessity of the policy itself there have not from the beginning exist a doubt in the mind of any calm judicious disinterested friend of the indian race accustom to reflection and enlighten by experience occupy the double character of contractor on its own account and guardian for the party contract with it be hardly to be expect that the dealing of the federal government with the indian tribe would escape misrepresentation that there occur ill the early settlement of this country as in all other where the civilized race have succeed to the possession of the savage instance of oppression and fraud on the part of the former there be too much reason to believe no such offense can however be justly charge upon this government since it become free to pursue its own course its dealing with the indian tribe have be just .and friendly throughout its effort for their civilization constant and direct by the good feeling of humanity its watchfulness in protect they from individual fraud unremitting its forbearance under the keenest provocation the deep injury and the most flagrant outrage may challenge at least a comparison with any nation ancient or modern in similar circumstance and if in future time a powerful civilized and happy nation of indians shall be find to exist within the limit of this northern continent it will be owe to the consummation of that policy which have be so unjustly assail only a very brief reference to fact in confirmation of this assertion can in this form be give and you be therefore necessarily refer to the report of the secretary of war for further detail to the cherokees whose case have perhaps excite the great share of attention and sympathy the united states have grant in fee with a perpetual guaranty of exclusive and peaceable possession 13,554,135 acre of land on the west side of the mississippi eligibly situate in a healthy climate and in all respect well suit to their condition than the country they have leave in exchange for only 9,492 160 acre on the east side of the same river the united states have in addition stipulate to pay they $ 5,600,000 for their interest in and improvement on the land thus relinquish and $ 1,160,000 for subsistence and other beneficial purpose thereby put it in their power to become one of the most wealthy and independent separate community of the same extent in the world by the treaty make and ratify with the miamies the chippewas the sioux the sacs and foxes and the winnebagoes during the last year the indian title to 18,458,000 acre have be extinguish these purchase have be much more extensive than those of any previous year and have with other indian expense bear very heavily upon the treasury they leave however but a small quantity of unbought indian land within the states and territories and the legislature and executive be equally sensible of the propriety of a final and more speedy extinction of indian title within those limit the treaty which be with a single exception make in pursuance of previous appropriation for defray the expense have subsequently be ratify by the senate and receive the sanction of congress by the appropriation necessary to carry they into effect of the term upon which these important negotiation be conclude i can speak from direct knowledge and i feel no difficulty in affirm that the interest of the indians in the extensive territory embrace by they be to be pay for at its fair value and that no more favorable term have be grant to the united states than would have be reasonably expect in a negotiation with civilized man fully capable of appreciate and protect their own right for the indian title to 116,349,897 acre acquire since the 4th of march 1829 the united states have pay $ 72,560,056 in permanent annuity land reservation for indians expense of removal and subsistence merchandise mechanical and agricultural establishment and implement when the heavy expense incur by the united states and the circumstance that so large a portion of the entire territory will be forever unsalable be consider and this price be compare with that for which the united states sell their own land no one can doubt that justice have be do to the indians in these purchase also certain it be that the transaction of the federal government with the indians have be uniformly characterize by a sincere and paramount desire to promote their welfare and it must be a source of the high gratification to every friend to justice and humanity to learn that not withstand the obstruction from time to time throw in its way and the difficulty which have arise from the peculiar and impracticable nature of the indian character the wise humane and undeviating policy of the government in this the most difficult of all our relation foreign or domestic have at length be justify to the world in its near approach to a happy and certain consummation the condition of the tribe which occupy the country set apart for they in the west be highly prosperous and encourage the hope of their early civilization they have for the most part abandon the hunter state and turn their attention to agricultural pursuit all those who have be establish for any length of time in that fertile region maintain themselves by their own industry there be among they trader of no inconsiderable capital and planter export cotton to some extent but the great number be small agriculturist live in comfort upon the produce of their farm the recent emigrant although they have in some instance remove reluctantly have readily acquiesce in their unavoidable destiny they have find at once a recompense for past suffering and an incentive to industrious habit in the abundance and comfort around they there be reason to believe that all these tribe be friendly in their feeling toward the united states and it be to be hope that the acquisition of individual wealth the pursuit of agriculture and habit of industry will gradually subdue their warlike propensity and incline they to maintain peace among themselves to effect this desirable object the attention of congress be solicit to the measure recommend by the secretary of war for their future government and protection as well from each other as from the hostility of the warlike tribe around they and the intrusion of the white the policy of the government have give they a permanent home and guarantee to they its peaceful and undisturbed possession it only remain to give they a government and law which will encourage industry and secure to they the reward of their exertion the importance of some form of government can not be too much insist upon the early effect will be to diminish the cause and occasion for hostility among the tribe to inspire an interest in the observance of law to which they will have themselves assent and to multiply the security of property and the motive for self improvement intimately connect with this subject be the establishment of the military defense recommend by the secretary of war which have be already refer to without they the government will be powerless to redeem its pledge of protection to the emigrate indians against the numerous warlike tribe that surround they and to provide for the safety of the frontier settler of the border state the case of the seminoles constitute at present the only exception to the successful effort of the government to remove the indians to the home assign they west of the mississippi four hundred of this tribe emigrate in 1836 and 1,500 in 1837 and 1838 leave in the country it be suppose about 2,000 indians the continued treacherous conduct of these people the savage and unprovoked murder they have lately commit butcher whole family of the settler of the territory without distinction of age or sex and make their way into the very center and heart of the country so that no part of it be free from their ravage their frequent attack on the light house along that dangerous coast and the barbarity with which they have murder the passenger and crew of such vessel as have be wreck upon the reef and key which border the gulf leave the government no alternative but to continue the military operation against they until they be totally expel from florida there be other motive which would urge the government to pursue this course toward the seminoles the united states have fulfil in good faith all their treaty stipulation with the indian tribe and have in every other instance insist upon a like performance of their obligation to relax from this salutary rule because the seminoles have maintain themselves so long in the territory they have relinquish and in defiance of their frequent and solemn engagement still continue to wage a ruthless war against the united states would not only evince a want of constancy on our part but be of evil example in our intercourse with other tribe experience have show that but little be to be gain by the march of army through a country so intersect with inaccessible swamp and marsh and which from the fatal character of the climate must be abandon at the end of the winter i recommend therefore to your attention the plan submit by the secretary of war in the accompany report for the permanent occupation of the portion of the territory free from the indians and the more efficient protection of the people of florida from their inhuman warfare from the report of the secretary of the navy herewith transmit it will appear that a large portion of the disposable naval force be either actively employ or in a state of preparation for the purpose of experience and discipline and the protection of our commerce so effectual have be this protection that so far as the information of government extend not a single outrage have be attempt on a vessel carry the flag of the united states within the present year in any quarter however distant or expose the explore expedition sail from norfolk on the 19th of august last and information have be receive of its safe arrival at the island of madeira the good spirit animate the officer and crew and there be every reason to anticipate from its effort result beneficial to commerce and honorable to the nation it will also be see that no reduction of the force now in commission be contemplate the unsettled state of a portion of south america render it indispensable that our commerce should receive protection in that quarter the vast and increase interest embark in the trade of the indian and china sea in the whale fishery of the pacific ocean and in the gulf of mexico require equal attention to their safety and a small squadron may be employ to great advantage on our atlantic coast in meet sudden demand for the reenforcement of other station in aid merchant vessel in distress in afford active service to an additional number of officer and in visit the different port of the united states an accurate knowledge of which be obviously of the high importance the attention of congress be respectfully call to that portion of the report recommend an increase in the number of small vessel and to other suggestion contain in that document the rapid increase and wide expansion of our commerce which be every day seek new avenue of profitable adventure the absolute necessity of a naval force for its protection precisely in the degree of its extension a due regard to the national right and honor the recollection of its former exploit and the anticipation of its future triumph whenever opportunity present itself which we may rightfully indulge from the experience of the past all seem to point to the navy as a most efficient arm of our national defense and a proper object of legislative encouragement the progress and condition of the post office department will be see by reference to the report of the postmaster general the extent of post road cover by mail contract be state to be 134,818 mile and the annual transportation upon they 34,580,202 mile the number of post office in the united states be 12,553 and rapidly increase the gross revenue for the year end on the 30th day of june last be $ 4,262,145 the accrue expenditure $ 4,680,068 excess of expenditure $ 417,923 this have be make up out of the surplus previously on hand the cash on hand on the 1st instant be $ 314,068 the revenue for the year end june 30 1838 be $ 161,540 more than that for the year end june 30 1837 the expenditure of the department have be graduate upon the anticipation of a largely increase revenue a moderate curtailment of mail service consequently become necessary and have be effect to shield the department against the danger of embarrassment its revenue be now improve and it will soon resume its onward course in the march of improvement your particular attention be request to so much of the postmaster general report as relate to the transportation of the mail upon railroad the law on that subject do not seem adequate to secure that service now become almost essential to the public interest and at the same time protect the department from combination and unreasonable demand nor can i too earnestly request your attention to the necessity of provide a more secure building for this department the danger of destruction to which its important book and paper be continually expose as well from the highly combustible character of the building occupy as from that of other in the vicinity call loudly for prompt action your attention be again earnestly invite to the suggestion and recommendation submit at the last session in respect to the district of columbia i feel it my duty also to bring to your notice certain proceeding at law which have recently be prosecute in this district in the name of the united states on the relation of messrs. stockton stokes of the state of maryland against the postmaster general and which have result in the payment of money out of the national treasury for the first time since the establishment of the government by judicial compulsion exercise by the common law writ of mandamus issue by the circuit court of this district the fact of the case and the ground of the proceeding will be find fully state in the report of the decision and any additional information which you may desire will be supply by the proper department no interference in the particular case be contemplate the money have be pay the claim of the prosecutor have be satisfy and the whole subject so far as they be concern be finally dispose of but it be on the supposition that the case may be regard as an authoritative exposition of the law as it now stand that i have think it necessary to present it to your consideration the object of the application to the circuit court be to compel the postmaster general to carry into effect an award make by the solicitor of the treasury under a special act of congress for the settlement of certain claim of the relator on the post office department which award the postmaster general decline to execute in full until he should receive further legislative direction on the subject if the duty impose on the postmaster general by that law be to be regard as one of an official nature belong to his office as a branch of the executive then it be obvious that the constitutional competency of the judiciary to direct and control he in its discharge be necessarily draw in question and if the duty so impose on the postmaster general be to be consider as merely ministerial and not executive it yet remain to be show that the circuit court of this district have authority to interfere by mandamus such a power having never before be assert or claim by that court with a view to the settlement of these important question the judgment of the circuit court be carry by a writ of error to the supreme court of the united states in the opinion of that tribunal the duty impose on the postmaster general be not an official executive duty but one of a merely ministerial nature the grave constitutional question which have be discuss be therefore exclude from the decision of the case the court indeed expressly admit that with power and duty properly belong to the executive no other department can inter fere by the writ of mandamus and the question therefore resolve itself into this have congress confer upon the circuit court of this district the power to issue such a writ to an officer of the general government command he to perform a ministerial act a majority of the court have decide that it have but have round their decision upon a process of reasoning which in my judgment render further legislative provision indispensable to the public interest and the equal administration of justice it have long since be decide by the supreme court that neither that tribunal nor the circuit court of the united states hold within the respective states possess the power in question but it be now hold that this power deny to both of these high tribunal to the former by the constitution and to the latter by congress have be by its legislation vest in the circuit court of this district no such direct grant of power to the circuit court of this district be claim but it have be hold to result by necessary implication from several section of the law establish the court one of these section declare that the law of maryland as they exist at the time of the cession should be in force in that part of the district cede by that state and by this provision the common law in civil and criminal case as it prevail in maryland in 1801 be establish in that part of the district in england the court of king 's bench because the sovereign who accord to the theory of the constitution be the fountain of justice originally sit there in person and be still deem to be present in construction of law alone possess the high power of issue the writ of mandamus not only to inferior jurisdiction and corporation but also to magistrate and other command they in the king s name to do what their duty require in case where there be a vested right and no other specific remedy it have be hold in the case refer to that as the supreme court of the united states be by the constitution render incompetent to exercise this power and as the circuit court of this district be a court of general jurisdiction in case at common law and the high court of original jurisdiction in the district the right to issue the writ of mandamus be incident to its common law power another ground rely upon to maintain the power in question be that it be include by fair construction in the power grant to the circuit court of the united states by the act to provide for the more convenient organization of the court of the united states pass 13th february 1801 that the act establish the circuit court of this district pass the 27th day of february 1801 confer upon that court and the judge thereof the same power as be by law vest in the circuit court of the united states and in the judge of the say court that the repeal of the first mention act which take place in the next year do not divest the circuit court of this district of the authority in dispute but leave it still clothe with the power over the subject which it be concede be take away from the circuit court of the united states by the repeal of the act of 13th february 1801 admit that the adoption of the law of maryland for a portion of this district confer on the circuit court thereof in that portion the transcendent extrajudicial prerogative power of the court of king 's bench in england or that either of the act of congress by necessary implication authorize the former court to issue a writ of mandamus to an officer of the united states to compel he to perform a ministerial duty the consequence be in one respect the same the result in either case be that the officer of the united states station in different part of the united states be in respect to the performance of their official duty subject to different law and a different supervision those in the states to one rule and those in the district of columbia to another and a very different one in the district their official conduct be subject to a judicial control from which in the states they be exempt whatever difference of opinion may exist as to the expediency of vest such a power in the judiciary in a system of government constitute like that of the united states all must agree that these disparage discrepancy in the law and in the administration of justice ought not to he permit to continue and as congress alone can provide the remedy the subject be unavoidably present to your consideration
to the senate and house of representatives
 i lay before congress several dispatch from his excellency the governor of maine with inclosure communicate certain proceeding of the legislature of that state and a copy of the reply of the secretary of state make by my direction together with a note from h. s. fox esq envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of great britain with the answer of the secretary of state to the same
 it will appear from those document that a numerous band of lawless and desperate man chiefly from the adjoining british provinces but without the authority or sanction of the provincial government have trespass upon that portion of the territory in dispute between the united states and great britain which be water by the river aroostook and claim to belong to the state of maine and that they have commit extensive depredation there by cut and destroy a very large quantity of timber it will far appear that the governor of maine having be officially apprise of the circumstance have communicate it to the legislature with a recommendation of such provision in addition to those already exist by law as would enable he to arrest the course of say depredation disperse the trespasser and secure the timber which they be about carry away that in compliance with a resolve of the legislature pass in pursuance of his recommendation his excellency have dispatch the land agent of the state with a force deem adequate to that purpose to the scene of the alleged depredation who after accomplish a part of his duty be seize by a band of the trespasser at a house claim to be within the jurisdiction of maine whither he have repair for the purpose of meeting and consult with the land agent of the province of new brunswick and convey as a prisoner to frederickton in that province together with two other citizen of the state who be assist he in the discharge of his duty
 it will also appear that the governor and legislature of maine satisfy that the trespasser have act in defiance of the law of both country learn that they be in possession of arm and anticipate correctly as the result have prove that person of their reckless and desperate character would set at naught the authority of the magistrate without the aid of a strong force have authorize the sheriff and the officer appoint in the place of the land agent to employ at the expense of the state an armed posse who have proceed to the scene of these depredation with a view to the entire dispersion or arrest of the trespasser and the protection of the public property
 in the correspondence between the governor of maine and sir john harvey lieutenant governor of the province of new brunswick which have grow out of these occurrence and be likewise herewith communicate the former be request to recall the armed party advance into the dispute territory for the arrest of trespasser and be inform that a strong body of british troop be to be hold in readiness to support and protect the authority and subject of great britain in say territory in answer to that request the provincial governor be inform of the determination of the state of maine to support the land agent and his party in the performance of their duty and the same determination for the execution of which provision be make by a resolve of the state legislature be communicate by the governor to the general government
 the lieutenant governor of new brunswick in call upon the governor of maine for the recall of the land agent and his party from the dispute territory and the british minster in make a similar demand upon the government of the united states proceed upon the assumption that an agreement exist between the two nation concede to great britain until the final settlement of the boundary question exclusive possession of and jurisdiction over the territory in dispute the important bearing which such an agreement if it exist would have upon the condition and interest of the party and the influence it might have upon the adjustment of the dispute be too obvious to allow the error upon which this assumption seem to rest to pass for a moment without correction the answer of the secretary of state to mr. fox&#39;s note will show the ground take by the government of the united states upon this point it be believe that all the correspondence which have pass between the two government upon this subject have already be communicate to congress and be now on their file an abstract of it however hastily prepare accompany this communication it be possible that in thus abridge a voluminous correspondence commence in 1825 and continue to a very recent period a portion may have be accidentally overlook but it be believe that nothing have take place which would materially change the aspect of the question as therein present instead of sustain the assumption of the british functionary that correspondence disprove the existence of any such agreement it show that the two government have differ not only in regard to the main question of title to the territory in dispute but with reference also to the right of jurisdiction and the fact of the actual exercise of it in different portion thereof
 always aim at an amicable adjustment of the dispute both party have entertain and repeatedly urge upon each other a desire that each should exercise its right whatever it consider they to be in such a manner as to avoid collision and allay to the great practicable extent the excitement likely to grow out of the controversy it be in pursuance of such an understanding that maine and massachusetts upon the remonstrance of great britain desist from make sale of land and the general government from the construction of a project military road in a portion of the territory of which they claim to have enjoy the exclusive possession and that great britain on her part in deference to a similar remonstrance from the united states suspend the issue of license to cut timber in the territory in controversy and also the survey and location of a railroad through a section of country over which she also claim to have exercise exclusive jurisdiction
 the state of maine have a right to arrest the depredation complain of it belong to she to judge of the exigency of the occasion call for her interference and it be presume that have the lieutenant governor of new brunswick be correctly advise of the nature of the proceeding of the state of maine he would not have regard the transaction as require on his part any resort to force each party claim a right to the territory and hence to the exclusive jurisdiction over it it be manifest that to prevent the destruction of the timber by trespasser act against the authority of both and at the same time avoid forcible collision between the contiguous government during the pendency of negotiation concern the title resort must be have to the mutual exercise of jurisdiction in such extreme case or to an amicable and temporary arrangement as to the limit within which it should be exercise by each party the understanding suppose to exist between the united states and great britain have be find heretofore sufficient for that purpose and i believe will prove so hereafter if the party on the frontier directly interested in the question be respectively govern by a just spirit of conciliation and forbearance if it shall be find as there be now reason to apprehend that there be in the mode of construe that understanding by the two government a difference not to be reconcile i shall not hesitate to propose to her britannic majesty&#39;s government a distinct arrangement for the temporary and mutual exercise of jurisdiction by mean of which similar difficulty may in future be prevent
 but between an effort on the part of maine to preserve the property in dispute from destruction by intruder and a military occupation by that state of the territory with a view to hold it by force while the settlement be a subject of negotiation between the two government there be an essential difference as well in respect to the position of the state as to the duty of the general government in a letter address by the secretary of state to the governor of maine on the 1st of march last give a detailed statement of the step which have be take by the federal government to bring the controversy to a termination and design to apprise the governor of that state of the view of the federal executive in respect to the future it be state that while the obligation of the federal government to do all in its power to effect the settlement of the boundary question be fully recognize it have in the event of be unable to do so specifically by mutual consent no other mean to accomplish that object amicably than by another arbitration or by a commission with an umpire in the nature of an arbitration and that in the event of all other measure fail the president would feel it his duty to submit another proposition to the government of great britain to refer the decision of the question to a third power these be still my view upon the subject and until this step shall have be take i can not think it proper to invoke the attention of congress to other than amicable mean for the settlement of the controversy or to cause the military power of the federal government to be bring in aid of the state of maine in any attempt to effect that object by a resort to force
 on the other hand if the authority of new brunswick should attempt to enforce the claim of exclusive jurisdiction set up by they by mean of a military occupation on their part of the dispute territory i shall feel myself bind to consider the contingency provide by the constitution as having occur on the happening of which a state have the right to call for the aid of the federal government to repel invasion
 i have express to the british minister near this government a confident expectation that the agent of the state of maine who have be arrest under an obvious misapprehension of the object of their mission will be promptly release and to the governor of maine that a similar course will be pursue in regard to the agent of the province of new brunswick i have also recommend that any militia that may have be bring together by the state of maine from an apprehension of a collision with the government or people of the british province will be voluntarily and peaceably disband
 i can not allow myself to doubt that the result anticipate from these representation will be seasonably realize the party more immediately interested can not but perceive that an appeal to arm under exist circumstance will not only prove fatal to their present interest but would postpone if not defeat the attainment of the main object which they have in view the very incident which have recently occur will necessarily awaken the government to the importance of promptly adjust a dispute by which it be now make manifest that the peace of the two nation be daily and imminently endanger this expectation be far warrant by the general forbearance which have hitherto characterize the conduct of the government and people on both side of the line in the uniform patriotism of maine her attachment to the union her respect for the wish of the people of her sister states of whose interest in her welfare she can not be unconscious and in the solicitude feel by the country at large for the preservation of peace with our neighbor we have a strong guaranty that she will not disregard the request that have be make of she
 as however the session of congress be about to terminate and the agency of the executive may become necessary during the recess it be important that the attention of the legislature should be draw to the consideration of such measure as may be calculate to obviate the necessity of a call for an extra session with that view i have think it my duty to lay the whole matter before you and to invite such action thereon as you may think the occasion require


fellow citizen of the senate and house of representatives i regret that i can not on this occasion congratulate you that the past year have be one of unalloyed prosperity the ravage of fire and disease have painfully afflict otherwise flourish portion of our country and serious embarrassment yet derange the trade of many of our city but notwithstanding these adverse circumstance that general prosperity which have be heretofore so bountifully bestow upon we by the author of all good still continue to call for our warm gratitude especially have we reason to rejoice in the exuberant harvest which have lavishly recompense well direct industry and give to it that sure reward which be vainly seek in visionary speculation i can not indeed view without peculiar satisfaction the evidence afford by the past season of the benefit that spring from the steady devotion of the husbandman to his honorable pursuit no mean of individual comfort be more certain and no source of national prosperity be so sure nothing can compensate a people for a dependence upon other for the bread they eat and that cheerful abundance on which the happiness of everyone so much depend be to be look for nowhere with such sure reliance as in the industry of the agriculturist and the bounty of the earth with foreign country our relation exhibit the same favorable aspect which be present in my last annual message and afford continue proof of the wisdom of the pacific just and forbear policy adopt by the first administration of the federal government and pursue by its successor the extraordinary power vest in i by an act of congress for the defense of the country in an emergency consider so far probable as to require that the executive should possess ample mean to meet it have not be exert they have therefore be attend with no other result than to increase by the confidence thus repose in i my obligation to maintain with religious exactness the cardinal principle that govern our intercourse with other nation happily in our pende question with great britain out of which this unusual grant of authority arise nothing have occur to require its exertion and as it be about to return to the legislature i trust that no future necessity may call for its exercise by they or its delegation to another department of the government for the settlement of our northeastern boundary the proposition promise by great britain for a commission of exploration and survey have be receive and a counter project include also a provision for the certain and final adjustment of the limit in dispute be now before the british government for its consideration a just regard to the delicate state of this question and a proper respect for the natural impatience of the state of maine not less than a conviction that the negotiation have be already protract long than be prudent on the part of either government have lead i to believe that the present favorable moment should on no account be suffer to pass without put the question forever at rest i feel confident that the government of her britannic majesty will take the same view of this subject as i be persuade it be govern by desire equally strong and sincere for the amicable termination of the controversy to the intrinsic difficulty of question of boundary line especially those describe in region unoccupied and but partially know be to be add in our country the embarrassment necessarily arise out of our constitution by which the general government be make the organ of negotiate and decide upon the particular interest of the states on whose frontier these line be to be trace to avoid another controversy in which a state government might rightfully claim to have her wish consult previously to the conclusion of conventional arrangement concern her right of jurisdiction or territory i have think it necessary to call the attention of the government of great britain to another portion of our conterminous dominion of which the division still remain to be adjust i refer to the line from the entrance of lake superior to the most northwestern point of the lake of the woods stipulation for the settlement of which be to be find in the seventh article of the treaty of ghent the commissioner appoint under that article by the two government having differ in their opinion make separate report accord to its stipulation upon the point of disagreement and these difference be now to be submit to the arbitration of some friendly sovereign or state the dispute point should be settle and the line designate before the territorial government of which it be one of the boundary take its place in the union as a state and i rely upon the cordial cooperation of the british government to effect that object there be every reason to believe that disturbance like those which lately agitate the neighboring british provinces will not again prove the source of border contention or interpose obstacle to the continuance of that good understanding which it be the mutual interest of great britain and the united states to preserve and maintain within the province themselves tranquillity be restore and on our frontier that misguide sympathy in favor of what be presume to be a general effort in behalf of popular right and which in some instance mislead a few of our more inexperienced citizen have subside into a rational conviction strongly oppose to all intermeddling with the internal affair of our neighbor the people of the united states feel as it be hope they always will a warm solicitude for the success of all who be sincerely endeavor to improve the political condition of mankind this generous feeling they cherish toward the most distant nation and it be natural therefore that it should be awaken with more than common warmth in behalf of their immediate neighbor but it do not belong to their character as a community to seek the gratification of those feeling in act which violate their duty as citizen endanger the peace of their country and tend to bring upon it the stain of a violate faith toward foreign nation if zealous to confer benefit on other they appear for a moment to lose sight of the permanent obligation impose upon they as citizen they be seldom long mislead from all the information i receive confirm to some extent by personal observation i be satisfied that no one can now hope to engage in such enterprise without encounter public indignation in addition to the severe penalty of the law recent information also lead i to hope that the emigrant from her majesty 's province who have seek refuge within our boundary be dispose to become peaceable resident and to abstain from all attempt to endanger the peace of that country which have afford they an asylum on a review of the occurrence on both side of the line it be satisfactory to reflect that in almost every complaint against our country the offense may be trace to emigrant from the province who have seek refuge here in the few instance in which they be aid by citizen of the united states the act of these misguided man be not only in direct contravention of the law and well know wish of their own government but meet with the decide disapprobation of the people of the united states i regret to state the appearance of a different spirit among her majesty 's subject in the canadas the sentiment of hostility to our people and institution which have be so frequently express there and the disregard of our right which have be manifest on some occasion have i be sorry to say be applaud and encourage by the people and even by some of the subordinate local authority of the provinces the chief officer in canada fortunately have not entertain the same feeling and have probably prevent excess that must have be fatal to the peace of the two country i look forward anxiously to a period when all the transaction which have grow out of this condition of our affair and which have be make the subject of complaint and remonstrance by the two government respectively shall be fully examine and the proper satisfaction give where it be due from either side nothing have occur to disturb the harmony of our intercourse with austria belgium denmark france naples portugal prussia russia or sweden the internal state of spain have sensibly improve and a well ground hope exist that the return of peace will restore to the people of that country their former prosperity and enable the government to fulfill all its obligation at home and abroad the government of portugal i have the satisfaction to state have pay in full the eleventh and last installment due to our citizen for the claim embrace in the settlement make with it on the 3d of march 1837 i lie before you treaty of commerce negotiate with the king of sardinia and of the netherlands the ratification of which have be exchange since the adjournment of congress the liberal principle of these treaty will recommend they to your approbation that with sardinia be the first treaty of commerce form by that kingdom and it will i trust answer the expectation of the present sovereign by aid the development of the resource of his country and stimulate the enterprise of his people that with the netherlands happily terminate a long exist subject of dispute and remove from our future commercial intercourse all apprehension of embarrassment the king of the netherlands have also in further illustration of his character for justice and of his desire to remove every cause of dissatisfaction make compensation for an american vessel capture in 1800 by a french privateer and carry into curacoa where the proceed be appropriate to the use of the colony then and for a short time after under the dominion of holland the death of the late sultan have produce no alteration in our relation with turkey our newly appoint minister resident have reach constantinople and i have receive assurance from the present ruler that the obligation of our treaty and those of friendship will be fulfil by himself in the same spirit that actuate his illustrious father i regret to be oblige to inform you that no convention for the settlement of the claim of our citizen upon mexico have yet be ratify by the government of that country the first convention form for that purpose be not present by the president of mexico for the approbation of its congress from a belief that the king of prussia the arbitrator in case of disagreement in the joint commission to be appoint by the united states and mexico would not consent to take upon himself that friendly office although not entirely satisfied with the course pursue by mexico i feel no hesitation in receive in the most conciliatory spirit the explanation offer and also cheerfully consent to a new convention in order to arrange the payment propose to be make to our citizen in a manner which while equally just to they be deem less onerous and inconvenient to the mexican government rely confidently upon the intention of that government mr. ellis be direct to repair to mexico and diplomatic intercourse have be resume between the two country the new convention have he inform we be recently submit by the president of that republic to its congress under circumstance which promise a speedy ratification a result which i can not allow myself to doubt instruction have be give to the commissioner of the united states under our convention with texas for the demarcation of the line which separate we from that republic the commissioner of both government meet in new orleans in august last the joint commission be organize and adjourn to convene at the same place on the 12th of october it be presume to be now in the performance of its duty the new government of texas have show its desire to cultivate friendly relation with we by a prompt reparation for injury complain of in the case of two vessel of the united states with central america a convention have be conclude for the renewal of its former treaty with the united states this be not ratify before the departure of our late charge d'affaires from that country and the copy of it bring by he be not receive before the adjournment of the senate at the last session in the meanwhile the period limit for the exchange of ratification having expire i deem it expedient in consequence of the death of the charge d'affaires to send a special agent to central america to close the affair of our mission there and to arrange with the government an extension of the time for the exchange of ratification the commission create by the states which formerly compose the republic of colombia for adjust the claim against that government have by a very unexpected construction of the treaty under which it act decide that no provision be make for those claim of citizen of the united states which arise from capture by colombian privateer and be adjudge against the claimant in the judicial tribunal this decision will compel the united states to apply to the several government formerly unite for redress with all these new granada venezuela and ecuador a perfectly good understanding exist our treaty with venezuela be faithfully carry into execution and that country in the enjoyment of tranquillity be gradually advance in prosperity under the guidance of its present distinguished president general paez with ecuador a liberal commercial convention have lately be conclude which will be transmit to the senate at an early day with the great american empire of brazil our relation continue unchanged as do our friendly intercourse with the other government of south america the argentine republic and the republics of uruguay chili peru and bolivia the dissolution of the peru bolivian confederation may occasion some temporary inconvenience to our citizen in that quarter but the obligation on the new government which have arise out of that confederation to observe its treaty stipulation will no doubt be soon understand and it be presume that no indisposition will exist to fulfill those which it contract with the united states the financial operation of the government during the present year have i be happy to say be very successful the difficulty under which the treasury department have labor from known defect in the exist law relative to the safe keeping of the public money aggravate by the suspension of specie payment by several of the bank hold public deposit or indebte to public officer for note receive in payment of public due have be surmount to a very gratifying extent the large current expenditure have be punctually meet and the faith of the government in all its pecuniary concern have be scrupulously maintain the nineteen million of treasury note authorize by the act of congress of 1837 and the modification thereof with a view to the indulgence of merchant on their duty bond and of the deposit bank in the payment of public money hold by they have be so punctually redeem as to leave less than the original ten million outstanding at any one time and the whole amount unredeemed now fall short of three million of these the chief portion be not due till next year and the whole would have be already extinguish could the treasury have realize the payment due to it from the bank if those due from they during the next year shall be punctually make and if congress shall keep the appropriation within the estimate there be every reason to believe that all the outstanding treasury note can be redeem and the ordinary expense defray without impose on the people any additional burden either of loan or increase taxis to avoid this and to keep the expenditure within reasonable bound be a duty second only in importance to the preservation of our national character and the protection of our citizen in their civil and political right the creation in time of peace of a debt likely to become permanent be an evil for which there be no equivalent the rapidity with which many of the states be apparently approach to this condition admonish we of our own duty in a manner too impressive to be disregard one not the least important be to keep the federal government always in a condition to discharge with ease and vigor its high function should their exercise be require by any sudden conjuncture of public affair a condition to which we be always expose and which may occur when it be least expect to this end it be indispensable that its finance should be untrammele and its resource as far as practicable unencumbered no circumstance could present great obstacle to the accomplishment of these vitally important object than the creation of an onerous national debt our own experience and also that of other nation have demonstrate the unavoidable and fearful rapidity with which a public debt be increase when the government have once surrender itself to the ruinous practice of supply its suppose necessity by new loan the struggle therefore on our part to be successful must be make at the threshold to make our effort effective severe economy be necessary this be the sure provision for the national welfare and it be at the same time the good preservative of the principle on which our institution rest simplicity and economy in the affair of state have never fail to chasten and invigorate republican principle while these have be as surely subvert by national prodigality under whatever specious pretext it may have be introduce or foster these consideration can not be lose upon a people who have never be inattentive to the effect of their policy upon the institution they have create for themselves but at the present moment their force be augment by the necessity which a decrease revenue must impose the check lately give to importation of article subject to duty the derangement in the operation of internal trade and especially the reduction gradually take place in our tariff of duty all tend materially to lessen our receipt indeed it be probable that the diminution result from the last cause alone will not fall short of $ 5,000,000 in the year 1842 as the final reduction of all duty to 20 per cent then take effect the whole revenue then accrue from the custom and from the sale of public land if not more will undoubtedly be want to defray the necessary expense of the government under the most prudent administration of its affair these be circumstance that impose the necessity of rigid economy and require its prompt and constant exercise with the legislature rest the power and duty of so adjust the public expenditure as to promote this end by the provision of the constitution it be only in consequence of appropriation make by law that money can be draw from the treasury no instance have occur since the establishment of the government in which the executive though a component part of the legislative power have interpose an objection to an appropriation bill on the sole ground of its extravagance his duty in this respect have be consider fulfil by request such appropriation only as the public service may be reasonably expect to require in the present earnest direction of the public mind toward this subject both the executive and the legislature have evidence of the strict responsibility to which they will be hold and while i be conscious of my own anxious effort to perform with fidelity this portion of my public function it be a satisfaction to i to be able to count on a cordial cooperation from you at the time i enter upon my present duty our ordinary disbursement without include those on account of the public debt the post office and the trust fund in charge of the government have be largely increase by appropriation for the removal of the indians for repel indian hostility and for other less urgent expense which grow out of an overflowing treasury independent of the redemption of the public debt and trust the gross expenditure of seventeen and eighteen million in 1834 and 1835 have by these cause swell to twenty nine million in 1836 and the appropriation for 1837 make previously to the 4th of march cause the expenditure to rise to the very large amount of thirty three million we be enable during the year 1838 notwithstanding the continuance of our indian embarrassment somewhat to reduce this amount and that for the present year 1839 will not in all probability exceed twenty six million or six million less than it be last year with a determination so far as depend on i to continue this reduction i have direct the estimate for 1840 to be subject to the severe scrutiny and to be limit to the absolute requirement of the public service they will be find less than the expenditure of 1839 by over $ 5,000,000 the precautionary measure which will be recommend by the secretary of the treasury to protect faithfully the public credit under the fluctuation and contingency to which our receipt and expenditure be expose and especially in a commercial crisis like the present be commend to your early attention on a former occasion your attention be invite to various consideration in support of a preemption law in behalf of the settler on the public land and also of a law graduate the price for such land as have long be in the market unsold in consequence of their inferior quality the execution of the act which be pass on the first subject have be attend with the happy consequence in quiet title and secure improvement to the industrious and it have also to a very gratifying extent be exempt from the fraud which be practice under previous preemption law it have at the same time as be anticipate contribute liberally during the present year to the receipt of the treasury the passage of a graduation law with the guard before recommend would also i be persuade add considerably to the revenue for several year and prove in other respect just and beneficial your early consideration of the subject be therefore once more earnestly request the present condition of the defense of our principal seaport and navy yard as represent by the accompany report of the secretary of war call for the early and serious attention of congress and as connect itself intimately with this subject i can not recommend too strongly to your consideration the plan submit by that officer for the organization of the militia of the united states in conformity with the express wish of congress an attempt be make in the spring to terminate the florida war by negotiation it be to be regret that these humane intention should have be frustrate and that the effort to bring these unhappy difficulty to a satisfactory conclusion should have fail but after enter into solemn engagement with the command general the indians without any provocation recommence their act of treachery and murder the renewal of hostility in that territory render it necessary that i should recommend to your favorable consideration the plan which will be submit to you by the secretary of war in order to enable that department to conduct they to a successful issue having have an opportunity of personally inspect a portion of the troop during the last summer it give i pleasure to bear testimony to the success of the effort to improve their discipline by keep they together in as large body as the nature of our service will permit i recommend therefore that commodious and permanent barrack be construct at the several post designate by the secretary of war notwithstanding the high state of their discipline and excellent police the evil result to the service from the deficiency of company officer be very apparent and i recommend that the staff officer be permanently separate from the line the navy have be usefully and honorably employ in protect the right and property of our citizen wherever the condition of affair seem to require its presence with the exception of one instance where an outrage accompany by murder be commit on a vessel of the united states while engage in a lawful commerce nothing be know to have occur to impede or molest the enterprise of our citizen on that element where it be so signally display on learn this daring act of piracy commodore reed proceed immediately to the spot and receive no satisfaction either in the surrender of the murderer or the restoration of the plunder property inflict severe and merit chastisement on the barbarian it will be see by the report of the secretary of the navy respect the disposition of our ship of war that it have be deem necessary to station a competent force on the coast of africa to prevent a fraudulent use of our flag by foreigner recent experience have show that the provision in our exist law which relate to the sale and transfer of american vessel while abroad be extremely defective advantage have be take of these defect to give to vessel wholly belong to foreigner and navigate the ocean an apparent american ownership this character have be so well simulate as to afford they comparative security in prosecute the slave trade a traffic emphatically denounce in our statute regard with abhorrence by our citizen and of which the effectual suppression be nowhere more sincerely desire than in the united states these circumstance make it proper to recommend to your early attention a careful revision of these law so that without impede the freedom and facility of our navigation or impair an important branch of our industry connect with it the integrity and honor of our flag may be carefully preserve information derive from our consul at havana show the necessity of this be communicate to a committee of the senate near the close of the last session but too late as it appear to be act upon it will be bring to your notice by the proper department with additional communication from other source the late account from the explore expedition represent it as proceed successfully in its object and promise result no less useful to trade and navigation than to science the extent of post road cover by mail service on the 1st of july last be about 133,999 mile and the rate of annual transportation upon they 34,496,878 mile the number of post office on that day be 12,780 and on the 30th ultimo 13,028 the revenue of the post office department for the year end with the 30th of june last be $ 4,476,638 exhibit an increase over the precede year of $ 241,560 the engagement and liability of the department for the same period be $ 4,624,117 the excess of liability over the revenue for the last two year have be meet out of the surplus which have previously accumulate the cash on hand on the 30th ultimo be about $ 206,701.95 and the current income of the department vary very little from the rate of current expenditure most of the service suspend last year have be restore and most of the new route establish by the act of 7th july 1838 have be set in operation at an annual cost of $ 136,963 notwithstanding the pecuniary difficulty of the country the revenue of the department appear to be increase and unless it shall be seriously check by the recent suspension of payment by so many of the bank it will be able not only to maintain the present mail service but in a short time to extend it it be gratify to witness the promptitude and fidelity with which the agent of this department in general perform their public duty some difficulty have arise in relation to contract for the transportation of the mail by railroad and steamboat company it appear that the maximum of compensation provide by congress for the transportation of the mail upon railroad be not sufficient to induce some of the company to convey they at such hour as be require for the accommodation of the public it be one of the most important duty of the general government to provide and maintain for the use of the people of the states the good practicable mail establishment to arrive at that end it be indispensable that the post office department shall be enable to control the hour at which the mail shall be carry over railroad as it now do over all other road should serious inconvenience arise from the inadequacy of the compensation now provide by law or from unreasonable demand by any of the railroad company the subject be of such general importance as to require the prompt attention of congress in relation to steamboat line the most efficient remedy be obvious and have be suggest by the postmaster general the war and navy departments already employ steamboat in their service and although it be by no mean desirable that the government should undertake the transportation of passenger or freight as a business there can be no reasonable objection to running boat temporarily whenever it may be necessary to put down attempt at extortion to be discontinue as soon as reasonable contract can be obtain the suggestion of the postmaster general relative to the inadequacy of the legal allowance to witness in case of prosecution for mail depredation merit your serious consideration the safety of the mail require that such prosecution shall be efficient and justice to the citizen whose time be require to be give to the public demand not only that his expense shall be pay but that he shall receive a reasonable compensation the report from the war navy and post office departments will accompany this communication and one from the treasury department will be present to congress in a few day for various detail in respect to the matter in charge of these departments i would refer you to those important document satisfied that you will find in they many valuable suggestion which will be find well deserve the attention of the legislature from a report make in december of last year by the secretary of state to the senate show the trial docket of each of the circuit court and the number of mile each judge have to travel in the performance of his duty a great inequality appear in the amount of labor assign to each judge the number of term to be hold in each of the court compose the ninth circuit the distance between the place at which they sit and from thence to the seat of government be represent to be such as to render it impossible for the judge of that circuit to perform in a manner correspond with the public exigency his term and circuit duty a revision therefore of the present arrangement of the circuit seem to be call for and be recommend to your notice i think it proper to call your attention to the power assume by territorial legislature to authorize the issue of bond by corporate company on the guaranty of the territory congress pass a law in 1836 provide that no act of a territorial legislature incorporate bank should have the force of law until approve by congress but act of a very exceptionable character previously pass by the legislature of florida be suffer to remain in force by virtue of which bond may be issue to a very large amount by those institution upon the faith of the territory a resolution intend to be a joint one pass the senate at the same session express the sense of congress that the law in question ought not to be permit to remain in force unless amend in many material respect but it fail in the house of representatives for want of time and the desire amendment have not be make the interest involve be of great importance and the subject deserve your early and careful attention the continue agitation of the question relative to the good mode of keep and disburse the public money still injuriously affect the business of the country the suspension of specie payment in 1837 render the use of deposit bank as prescribe by the act of 1836 a source rather of embarrassment than aid and of necessity place the custody of most of the public money afterwards collect in charge of the public officer the new security for its safety which this require be a principal cause of my convene an extra session of congress but in consequence of a disagreement between the two houses neither then nor at any subsequent period have there be any legislation on the subject the effort make at the last session to obtain the authority of congress to punish the use of public money for private purpose as a crime a measure attend under other government with signal advantage be also unsuccessful from diversity of opinion in that body notwithstanding the anxiety doubtless feel by it to afford every practicable security the result of this be still to leave the custody of the public money without those safeguard which have be for several year earnestly desire by the executive and as the remedy be only to be find in the action of the legislature it impose on i the duty of again submit to you the propriety of pass a law provide for the safe keeping of the public money and especially to ask that its use for private purpose by any officer intrust with it may be declare to be a felony punishable with penalty proportion to the magnitude of the offense these circumstance add to known defect in the exist law and unusual derangement in the general operation of trade have during the last three year much increase the difficulty attendant on the collection keeping and disbursement of the revenue and call forth corresponding exertion from those have they in charge happily these have be successful beyond expectation vast sum have be collect and disburse by the several departments with unexpected cheapness and ease transfer have be readily make to every part of the union however distant and defalcation have be far less than might have be anticipate from the absence of adequate legal restraint since the officer of the treasury and post office departments be charge with the custody of most of the public money receive by they there have be collect $ 66,000,000 and exclude the case of the late collector at new york the aggregate amount of loss sustain in the collection can not it be believe exceed $ 60,000 the defalcation of the late collector at that city of the extent and circumstance of which congress have be fully inform run through all the mode of keep the public money that have be hitherto in use and be distinguish by an aggravate disregard of duty that break through the restraint of every system and can not therefore be usefully refer to as a test of the comparative safety of either additional information will also be furnish by the report of the secretary of the treasury in reply to a call make upon that officer by the house of representatives at the last session require detailed information on the subject of default by public officer or agent under each administration from 1789 to 1837 this document will be submit to you in a few day the general result independent of the post office which be keep separately and will be state by itself so far as they bear upon this subject be that the loss which have be and be likely to be sustain by any class of agent have be the great by bank include as require in the resolution their depreciated paper receive for public due that the next large have be by disburse officer and the least by collector and receiver if the loss on duty bond be include they alone will be threefold those by both collector and receiver our whole experience therefore furnish the strong evidence that the desire legislation of congress be alone want to insure in those operation the high degree of security and facility such also appear to have be the experience of other nation from the result of inquiry make by the secretary of the treasury in regard to the practice among they i be enable to state that in twenty two out of twenty seven foreign government from which undoubted information have be obtain the public money be keep in charge of public officer this concurrence of opinion in favor of that system be perhaps as great as exist on any question of internal administration in the mode of business and official restraint on disburse officer no legal change be produce by the suspension of specie payment the report last refer to will be find to contain also much useful information in relation to this subject i have heretofore assign to congress my reason for believe that the establishment of an independent national treasury as contemplate by the constitution be necessary to the safe action of the federal government the suspension of specie payment in 1837 by the bank have the custody of the public money show in so alarm a degree our dependence on those institution for the performance of duty require by law that i then recommend the entire dissolution of that connection this recommendation have be subject as i desire it should be to severe scrutiny and animate discussion and i allow myself to believe that notwithstanding the natural diversity of opinion which may be anticipate on all subject involve such important consideration it have secure in its favor as general a concurrence of public sentiment as could be expect on one of such magnitude recent event have also continue to develop new objection to such a connection seldom be any bank under the exist system and practice able to meet on demand all its liability for deposit and note in circulation it maintain specie payment and transact a profitable business only by the confidence of the public in its solvency and whenever this be destroy the demand of its depositor and note holder press more rapidly than it can make collection from its debtor force it to stop payment this loss of confidence with its consequence occur in 1837 and afford the apology of the bank for their suspension the public then acquiesce in the validity of the excuse and while the state legislature do not exact from they their forfeit charter congress in accordance with the recommendation of the executive allow they time to pay over the public money they hold although compel to issue treasury note to supply the deficiency thus create it now appear that there be other motive than a want of public confidence under which the bank seek to justify themselves in a refusal to meet their obligation scarcely be the country and government relieve in a degree from the difficulty occasion by the general suspension of 1837 when a partial one occur within thirty month of the former produce new and serious embarrassment though it have no palliation in such circumstance as be allege in justification of that which have previously take place there be nothing in the condition of the country to endanger a well manage banking institution commerce be derange by no foreign war every branch of manufacturing industry be crown with rich reward and the more than usual abundance of our harvest after supply our domestic want have leave our granary and storehouse fill with a surplus for exportation it be in the midst of this that an irredeemable and depreciated paper currency be entail upon the people by a large portion of the bank they be not drive to it by the exhibition of a loss of public confidence or of a sudden pressure from their depositor or note holder but they excuse themselves by allege that the current of business and exchange with foreign country which draw the precious metal from their vault would require in order to meet it a large curtailment of their loan to a comparatively small portion of the community than it will be convenient for they to bear or perhaps safe for the bank to exact the plea have cease to be one of necessity convenience and policy be now deem sufficient to warrant these institution in disregard their solemn obligation such conduct be not merely an injury to individual creditor but it be a wrong to the whole community from whose liberality they hold most valuable privilege whose right they violate whose business they derange and the value of whose property they render unstable and insecure it must be evident that this new ground for bank suspension in reference to which their action be not only disconnect with but wholly independent of that of the public give a character to their suspension more alarming than any which they exhibit before and greatly increase the impropriety of rely on the bank in the transaction of the government a large and highly respectable portion of our banking institution be it afford i unfeigned pleasure to state exempt from all blame on account of this second delinquency they have to their great credit not only continue to meet their engagement but have even repudiate the ground of suspension now resort to it be only by such a course that the confidence and good will of the community can be preserve and in the sequel the good interest of the institution themselves promote new danger to the bank be also daily disclose from the extension of that system of extravagant credit of which they be the pillar formerly our foreign commerce be principally rounded on an exchange of commodity include the precious metal and leave in its transaction but little foreign debt such be not now the case aid by the facility afford by the bank mere credit have become too commonly the basis of trade many of the bank themselves not content with largely stimulate this system among other have usurp the business while they impair the stability of the mercantile community they have become borrower instead of lender they establish their agency abroad they deal largely in stock and merchandise they encourage the issue of state security until the foreign market be glut with they and unsatisfie with the legitimate use of their own capital and the exercise of their lawful privilege they raise by large loan additional mean for every variety of speculation the disaster attendant on this deviation from the former course of business in this country be now share alike by bank and individual to an extent of which there be perhaps no previous example in the annal of our country so long as a willingness of the foreign lender and a sufficient export of our production to meet any necessary partial payment leave the flow of credit undisturbe all appear to be prosperous but as soon as it be check by any hesitation abroad or by an inability to make payment there in our production the evil of the system be disclose the paper currency which might serve for domestic purpose be useless to pay the debt due in europe gold and silver be therefore draw in exchange for their note from the bank to keep up their supply of coin these institution be oblige to call upon their own debtor who pay they principally in their own note which be as unavailable to they as they be to the merchant to meet the foreign demand the call of the bank therefore in such emergency of necessity exceed that demand and produce a corresponding curtailment of their accommodation and of the currency at the very moment when the state of trade render it most inconvenient to be bear the intensity of this pressure on the community be in proportion to the previous liberality of credit and consequent expansion of the currency force sale of property be make at the time when the mean of purchasing be most reduce and the bad calamitie to individual be only at last arrest by an open violation of their obligation by the bank a refusal to pay specie for their note and an imposition upon the community of a fluctuating and depreciated currency these consequence be inherent in the present system they be not influence by the bank be large or small create by national or state government they be the result of the irresistible law of trade or credit in the recent event which have so strikingly illustrate the certain effect of these law we have see the bank of the large capital in the union establish under a national charter and lately strengthen as we be authoritatively inform by exchange that for a state charter with new and unusual privilege in a condition too as it be say of entire soundness and great prosperity not merely unable to resist these effect but the first to yield to they nor be it to be overlook that there exist a chain of necessary dependence among these institution which oblige they to a great extent to follow the course of other notwithstanding its injustice to their own immediate creditor or injury to the particular community in which they be place this dependence of a bank which be in proportion to the extent of its debt for circulation and deposit be not merely on other in its own vicinity but on all those which connect it with the center of trade distant bank may fail without seriously affect those in our principal commercial city but the failure of the latter be feel at the extremity of the union the suspension at new york in 1837 be everywhere with very few exception follow as soon as it be know that recently at philadelphia immediately affect the bank of the south and west in a similar manner this dependence of our whole banking system on the institution in a few large city be not find in the law of their organization but in those of trade and exchange the bank at that center to which currency flow and where it be require in payment for merchandise hold the power of control those in region whence it come while the latter possess no mean of restrain they so that the value of individual property and the prosperity of trade through the whole interior of the country be make to depend on the good or bad management of the banking institution in the great seat of trade on the seaboard but this chain of dependence do not stop here it do not terminate at philadelphia or new york it reach across the ocean and end in london the center of the credit system the same law of trade which give to the bank in our principal city power over the whole banking system of the united states subject the former in their turn to the money power in great britain it be not deny that the suspension of the new york bank in 1837 which be follow in quick succession throughout the union be produce by an application of that power and it be now allege in extenuation of the present condition of so large a portion of our bank that their embarrassment have arise from the same cause from this influence they can not now entirely escape for it have its origin in the credit currency of the two country it be strengthen by the current of trade and exchange which center in london and be render almost irresistible by the large debt contract there by our merchant our bank and our states it be thus that an introduction of a new bank into the most distant of our village place the business of that village within the influence of the money power in england it be thus that every new debt which we contract in that country seriously affect our own currency and extend over the pursuit of our citizen its powerful influence we can not escape from this by make new bank great or small state or national the same chain which bind those now exist to the center of this system of paper credit must equally fetter every similar institution we create it be only by the extent to which this system have be push of late that we have be make fully aware of its irresistible tendency to subject our own bank and currency to a vast control power in a foreign lad and it add a new argument to those which illustrate their precarious situation endanger in the first place by their own mismanagement and again by the conduct of every institution which connect they with the center of trade in our own country they be yet subject beyond all this to the effect of whatever measure policy necessity or caprice may induce those who control the credit of england to resort to i mean not to comment upon these measure present or past and much less to discourage the prosecution of fair commercial dealing between the two country base on reciprocal benefit but it having now be make manifest that the power of inflict these and similar injury be by the resistless law of a credit currency and credit trade equally capable of extend their consequence through all the ramification of our banking system and by that mean indirectly obtain particularly when our bank be use as depository of the public money a dangerous political influence in the united states i have deem it my duty to bring the subject to your notice and ask for it your serious consideration be an argument require beyond the exposition of these fact to show the impropriety of use our banking institution as depository of the public money can we venture not only to encounter the risk of their individual and mutual mismanagement but at the same time to place our foreign and domestic policy entirely under the control of a foreign moneyed interest to do so be to impair the independence of our government as the present credit system have already impair the independence of our bank it be to submit all its important operation whether of peace or war to be control or thwart at first by our own bank and then by a power abroad great than themselves i can not bring myself to depict the humiliation to which this government and people might be soon or later reduce if the mean for defend their right be to be make dependent upon those who may have the most powerful of motive to impair they nor be it only in reference to the effect of this state of thing on the independence of our government or of our bank that the subject present itself for consideration it be to be view also in its relation to the general trade of our country the time be not long pass when a deficiency of foreign crop be think to afford a profitable market for the surplus of our industry but now we await with feverish anxiety the news of the english harvest not so much from motive of commendable sympathy but fearful lest its anticipated failure should narrow the field of credit there do not this speak volume to the patriot can a system be beneficent wise or just which create great anxiety for interest dependent on foreign credit than for the general prosperity of our own country and the profitable exportation of the surplus produce of our labor the circumstance to which i have thus advert appear to i to afford weighty reason develop by late event to be add to those which i have on former occasion offer when submit to your well knowledge and discernment the propriety of separate the custody of the public money from banking institution nor have anything occur to lessen in my opinion the force of what have be heretofore urge the only ground on which that custody can be desire by the bank be the profitable use which they may make of the money such use would be regard in individual as a breach of trust or a crime of great magnitude and yet it may be reasonably doubted whether first and last it be not attend with more mischievous consequence when permit to the former than to the latter the practice of permit the public money to be use by its keeper as here be believe to be peculiar to this country and to exist scarcely anywhere else to procure it here improper influence be appeal to unwise connection be establish between the government and vast number of powerful state institution other motive than the public good be bring to bear both on the executive and legislative department and selfish combination lead to special legislation be form it be make the interest of banking institution and their stockholder throughout the union to use their exertion for the increase of taxation and the accumulation of a surplus revenue and while an excuse be afford the mean be furnish for those excessive issue which lead to extravagant trading and speculation and be the forerunner of a vast debt abroad and a suspension of the bank at home impressed therefore as i be with the propriety of the fund of the government be withdraw from the private use of either bank or individual and the public money keep by duly appoint public agent and believe as i do that such also be the judgment which discussion reflection and experience have produce on the public mind i leave the subject with you it be at all event essential to the interest of the community and the business of the government that a decision should be make most of the argument that dissuade we from employ bank in the custody and disbursement of the public money apply with equal force to the receipt of their note for public due the difference be only in form in one instance the government be a creditor for its deposit and in the other for the note it hold they afford the same opportunity for use the public money and equally lead to all the evil attendant upon it since a bank can as safely extend its discount on a deposit of its note in the hand of a public officer as on one make in its own vault on the other hand it would give to the government no great security for in case of failure the claim of the note holder would be no well than that of a depositor i be aware that the danger of inconvenience to the public and unreasonable pressure upon sound bank have be urge as objection to require the payment of the revenue in gold and silver these objection have be greatly exaggerated from the good estimate we may safely fix the amount of specie in the country at $ 85,000,000 and the portion of that which would be employ at any one time in the receipt and disbursement of the government even if the propose change be make at once would not it be now after full investigation believe exceed four or five million if the change be gradual several year would elapse before that sum would be require with annual opportunity in the meantime to alter the law should experience prove it to be oppressive or inconvenient the portion of the community on whose business the change would immediately operate be comparatively small nor be it believe that its effect would be in the least unjust or injurious to they in the payment of duty which constitute by far the great portion of the revenue a very large proportion be derive from foreign commission house and agent of foreign manufacturer who sell the good consign to they generally at auction and after pay the duty out of the avail remit the rest abroad in specie or its equivalent that the amount of duty should in such case be also retain in specie can hardly be make a matter of complaint our own import merchant by whom the residue of the duty be pay be not only peculiarly interested in maintain a sound currency which the measure in question will especially promote but be from the nature of their dealing well able to know when specie will be need and to procure it with the least difficulty or sacrifice residing too almost universally in place where the revenue be receive and where the draft use by the government for its disbursement must concentrate they have every opportunity to obtain and use they in place of specie should it be for their interest or convenience of the number of these draft and the facility they may afford as well as of the rapidity with which the public fund be draw and disburse an idea may be form from the fact that of nearly $ 20,000,000 pay to collector and receiver during the present year the average amount in their hand at any one time have not exceed a million and a half and of the fifteen million receive by the collector of new york alone during the present year the average amount hold by he subject to draft during each week have be less than half a million the ease and safety of the operation of the treasury in keep the public money be promote by the application of its own draft to the public due the objection arise from have they too long outstanding might be obviate and they yet make to afford to merchant and bank hold they an equivalent for specie and in that way greatly lessen the amount actually require still less inconvenience will attend the requirement of specie in purchase of public land such purchase except when make on speculation be in general but single transaction rarely repeat by the same person and it be a fact that for the last year and a half during which the note of sound bank have be receive more than a moiety of these payment have be voluntarily make in specie be a large proportion than would have be require in three year under the graduation propose it be moreover a principle than which none be well settle by experience that the supply of the precious metal will always be find adequate to the use for which they be require they abound in country where no other currency be allow in our own states where small note be exclude gold and silver supply their place when drive to their hiding place by bank suspension a little firmness in the community soon restore they in a sufficient quantity for ordinary purpose postage and other public due have be collect in coin without serious inconvenience even in states where a depreciate paper currency have exist for year and this with the aid of treasury note for a part of the time be do without interruption during the suspension of 1837 at the present moment the receipt and disbursement of the government be make in legal currency in the large portion of the union no one suggest a departure from this rule and if it can now be successfully carry out it will be surely attend with even less difficulty when bank note be again redeem in specie indeed i can not think that a serious objection would anywhere be raise to the receipt and payment of gold and silver in all public transaction be it not from an apprehension that a surplus in the treasury might withdraw a large portion of it from circulation and lock it up unprofitably in the public vault it would not in my opinion be difficult to prevent such an inconvenience from occur but the authentic statement which i have already submit to you in regard to the actual amount in the public treasury at any one time during the period embrace in they and the little probability of a different state of the treasury for at least some year to come seem to render it unnecessary to dwell upon it congress moreover as i have before observe will in every year have an opportunity to guard against it should the occurrence of any circumstance lead we to apprehend injury from this source view the subject in all its aspect i can not believe that any period will be more auspicious than the present for the adoption of all measure necessary to maintain the sanctity of our own engagement and to aid in securing to the community that abundant supply of the precious metal which add so much to their prosperity and give such increase stability to all their dealing in a country so commercial as ours bank in some form will probably always exist but this serve only to render it the more incumbent on we notwithstanding the discouragement of the past to strive in our respective station to mitigate the evil they produce to take from they as rapidly as the obligation of public faith and a careful consideration of the immediate interest of the community will permit the unjust character of monopoly to check so far as may be practicable by prudent legislation those temptation of interest and those opportunity for their dangerous indulgence which beset they on every side and to confine they strictly to the performance of their paramount duty that of aid the operation of commerce rather than consult their own exclusive advantage these and other salutary reform may it be believe be accomplish without the violation of any of the great principle of the social compact the observance of which be indispensable to its existence or interfere in any way with the useful and profitable employment of real capital institution so framed have exist and still exist elsewhere give to commercial intercourse all necessary facility without inflate or depreciate the currency or stimulate speculation thus accomplish their legitimate end they have gain the sure guaranty for their protection and encouragement in the good will of the community among a people so just as ours the same result could not fail to attend a similar course the direct supervision of the bank belong from the nature of our government to the states who authorize they it be to their legislature that the people must mainly look for action on that subject but as the conduct of the federal government in the management of its revenue have also a powerful though less immediate influence upon they it become our duty to see that a proper direction be give to it while the keeping of the public revenue in a separate and independent treasury and of collect it in gold and silver will have a salutary influence on the system of paper credit with which all bank be connect and thus aid those that be sound and well manage it will at the same time sensibly check such as be otherwise by at once withhold the mean of extravagance afford by the public fund and restrain they from excessive issue of note which they would be constantly call upon to redeem i be aware it have be urge that this control may be well attain and exert by mean of a national bank the constitutional objection which i be well known to entertain would prevent i in any event from propose or assent to that remedy but in addition to this i can not after past experience bring myself to think that it can any long be extensively regard as effective for such a purpose the history of the late national bank through all its mutation show that it be not so on the contrary it may after a careful consideration of the subject be i think safely state that at every period of bank excess it take the lead that in 1817 and 1818 in 1823 in 1831 and in 1834 its vast expansion follow by distress contraction lead to those of the state institution it swell and madden the tide of the banking system but seldom allay or safely direct they at a few period only be a salutary control exercise but an eager desire on the contrary exhibit for profit in the first place and if afterwards its measure be severe toward other institution it be because its own safety compel it to adopt they it do not differ from they in principle or in form its measure emanate from the same spirit of gain it feel the same temptation to overissue it suffer from and be totally unable to avert those inevitable law of trade by which it be itself affect equally with they and at least on one occasion at an early day it be save only by extraordinary exertion from the same fate that attend the weak institution it profess to supervise in 1837 it fail equally with other in redeem its note though the two year allow by its charter for that purpose have not expire a large amount of which remain to the present time outstanding it be true that have so vast a capital and strengthen by the use of all the revenue of the government it possess more power but while it be itself by that circumstance free from the control which all bank require its paramount object and inducement be leave the same to make the most for its stockholder not to regulate the currency of the country nor have it as far as we be advise be find to be greatly otherwise elsewhere the national character give to the bank of england have not prevent excessive fluctuation in their currency and it prove unable to keep off a suspension of specie payment which last for nearly a quarter of a century and why should we expect it to be otherwise a national institution though derive its charter from a different source than the state bank be yet constitute upon the same principle be conduct by man equally expose to temptation and be liable to the same disaster with the additional disadvantage that its magnitude occasion an extent of confusion and distress which the mismanagement of small institution could not produce it can scarcely be doubt that the recent suspension of the united state bank of pennsylvania of which the effect be feel not in that state alone but over half the union have its origin in a course of business commence while it be a national institution and there be no good reason for suppose that the same consequence would not have follow have it still derive its power from the general government it be in vain when the influence and impulse be the same to look for a difference in conduct or result by such creation we do therefore but increase the mass of paper credit and paper currency without check their attendant evil and fluctuation the extent of power and the efficiency of organization which we give so far from be beneficial be in practice positively injurious they strengthen the chain of dependence throughout the union subject all part more certainly to common disaster and bind every bank more effectually in the first instance to those of our commercial city and in the end to a foreign power in a word i can not but believe that with the full understanding of the operation of our banking system which experience have produce public sentiment be not less opposed to the creation of a national bank for purpose connect with currency and commerce than for those connect with the fiscal operation of the government yet the commerce and currency of the country be suffer evil from the operation of the state bank which can not and ought not to be overlook by their mean we have be flood with a depreciate paper which it be evidently the design of the framer of the constitution to prevent when they require congress to coin money and regulate the value of foreign coin and when they forbid the states to coin money emit bill of credit make anything but gold and silver a tender in payment of debt or pass any law impair the obligation of contract if they do not guard more explicitly against the present state of thing it be because they could not have anticipate that the few bank then exist be to swell to an extent which would expel to so great a degree the gold and silver for which they have provide from the channel of circulation and fill they with a currency that defeat the object they have in view the remedy for this must chiefly rest with the states from whose legislation it have spring no good that might accrue in a particular case front the exercise of power not obviously confer on the general government would authorize its interference or justify a course that might in the slight degree increase at the expense of the states the power of the federal authority nor do i doubt that the states will apply the remedy within the last few year event have appeal to they too strongly to be disregard they have see that the constitution though theoretically adhere to be subvert in practice that while on the statute book there be no legal tender but gold and silver no law impair the obligation of contract yet that in point of fact the privilege confer on banking corporation have make their note the currency of the country that the obligation impose by these note be violate under the impulse of interest or convenience and that the number and power of the person connect with these corporation or place under their influence give they a fearful weight when their interest be in opposition to the spirit of the constitution and law to the people it be immaterial whether these result be produce by open violation of the latter or by the working of a system of which the result be the same an inflexible execution even of the exist statute of most of the states would redress many evil now endure would effectually show the bank the danger of mismanagement which impunity encourage they to repeat and would teach all corporation the useful lesson that they be the subject of the law and the servant of the people what be still want to effect these object must be seek in additional legislation or if that be inadequate in such further constitutional grant or restriction as may bring we back into the path from which we have so widely wander in the meantime it be the duty of the general government to cooperate with the states by a wise exercise of its constitutional power and the enforcement of its exist law the extent to which it may do so by further enactment i have already advert to and the wisdom of congress may yet enlarge they but above all it be incumbent upon we to hold erect the principle of morality and law constantly execute our own contract in accordance with the provision of the constitution and thus serve as a rallying point by which our whole country may be bring back to that safe and honored standard our people will not long be insensible to the extent of the burden entail upon they by the false system that have be operate on their sanguine energetic and industrious character nor to the mean necessary to extricate themselves from these embarrassment the weight which press upon a large portion of the people and the states be an enormous debt foreign and domestic the foreign debt of our states corporation and man of business can scarcely be less than $ 200,000,000 require more than $ 10,000,000 a year to pay the interest this sum have to be pay out of the export of the country and must of necessity cut off import to that extent or plunge the country more deeply in debt from year to year it be easy to see that the increase of this foreign debt must augment the annual demand on the export to pay the interest and to the same extent diminish the import and in proportion to the enlargement of the foreign debt and the consequent increase of interest must be the decrease of the import trade in lieu of the comfort which it now bring we we might have our gigantic banking institution and splendid but in many instance profitless railroad and canal absorb to a great extent in interest upon the capital borrow to construct they the surplus fruit of national industry for year to come and secure to posterity no adequate return for the comfort which the labor of their hand might otherwise have secure it be not by the increase of this debt that relief be to be seek but in its diminution upon this point there be i be happy to say hope before we not so much in the return of confidence abroad which will enable the states to borrow more money as in a change of public feeling at home which prompt our people to pause in their career and think of the mean by which debt be to be pay before they be contract if we would escape embarrassment public and private we must cease to run in debt except for object of necessity or such as will yield a certain return let the faith of the states corporation and individual already pledge be keep with the most punctilious regard it be due to our national character as well as to justice that this should on the part of each be a fixed principle of conduct but it behoove we all to be more chary in pledge it hereafter by cease to run in debt and apply the surplus of our crop and income to the discharge of exist obligation buy less and sell more and manage all affair public and private with strict economy and frugality we shall see our country soon recover from a temporary depression arise not from natural and permanent cause but from those i have enumerate and advance with renew vigor in her career of prosperity fortunately for we at this moment when the balance of trade be greatly against we and the difficulty of meet it enhance by the disturbed state of our money affair the bounty of providence have come to relieve we from the consequence of past error a faithful application of the immense result of the labor of the last season will afford partial relief for the present and perseverance in the same course will in due season accomplish the rest we have have full experience in time past of the extraordinary result which can in this respect be bring about in a short period by the united and well direct effort of a community like ours our surplus profit the energy and industry of our population and the wonderful advantage which providence have bestow upon our country in its climate its various production indispensable to other nation will in due time afford abundant mean to perfect the most useful of those object for which the states have be plunge themselves of late in embarrassment and debt without impose on ourselves or our child such fearful burden but let it be indelibly engrave on our mind that relief be not to be find in expedient indebtedness can not be lessen by borrow more money or by change the form of the debt the balance of trade be not to be turn in our favor by create new demand upon we abroad our currency can not be improve by the creation of new bank or more issue from those which now exist although these device sometimes appear to give temporary relief they almost invariably aggravate the evil in the end it be only by retrenchment and reform by curtail public and private expenditure by pay our debt and by reform our banking system that we be to expect effectual relief security for the future and an endure prosperity in shape the institution and policy of the general government so as to promote as far as it can with its limited power these important end you may rely on my most cordial cooperation that there should have be in the progress of recent event doubt in many quarter and in some a heated opposition to every change can not surprise we doubt be properly attendant on all reform and it be peculiarly in the nature of such abuse as we be now encounter to seek to perpetuate their power by mean of the influence they have be permit to acquire it be their result if not their object to gain for the few an ascendency over the many by secure to they a monopoly of the currency the medium through which most of the want of mankind be supply to produce throughout society a chain of dependence which lead all class to look to privileged association for the mean of speculation and extravagance to nourish in preference to the manly virtue that give dignity to human nature a craving desire for luxurious enjoyment and sudden wealth which render those who seek they dependent on those who supply they to substitute for republican simplicity and economical habit a sickly appetite for effeminate indulgence and an imitation of that reckless extravagance which impoverish and enslave the industrious people of foreign land and at last to fix upon we instead of those equal political right the acquisition of which be alike the object and suppose reward of our revolutionary struggle a system of exclusive privilege confer by partial legislation to remove the influence which have thus gradually grow up among we to deprive they of their deceptive advantage to test they by the light of wisdom and truth to oppose the force which they concentrate in their sup port all this be necessarily the work of time even among a people so enlightened and pure as that of the united states in most other country perhaps it could only be accomplish through that series of revolutionary movement which be too often find necessary to effect any great and radical reform but it be the crown merit of our institution that they create and nourish in the vast majority of our people a disposition and a power peaceably to remedy abuse which have elsewhere cause the effusion of river of blood and the sacrifice of thousand of the human race the result thus far be most honorable to the self denial the intelligence and the patriotism of our citizen it justify the confident hope that they will carry through the reform which have be so well begun and that they will go still far than they have yet go in illustrate the important truth that a people as free and enlighten as ours will whenever it become necessary show themselves to be indeed capable of self government by voluntarily adopt appropriate remedy for every abuse and submit to temporary sacrifice however great to insure their permanent welfare my own exertion for the furtherance of these desirable object have be bestow throughout my official career with a zeal that be nourish by ardent wish for the welfare of my country and by an unlimited reliance on the wisdom that mark its ultimate decision on all great and controvert question impress with the solemn obligation impose upon i by the constitution desirous also of lay before my fellow citizen with whose confidence and support i have be so highly honor such measure as appear to i conducive to their prosperity and anxious to submit to their full consideration the ground upon which my opinion be form i have on this as on precede occasion freely offer my view on those point of domestic policy that seem at the present time most prominently to require the action of the government i know that they will receive from congress that full and able consideration which the importance of the subject merit and i can repeat the assurance heretofore make that i shall cheerfully and readily cooperate with you in every measure that will tend to promote the welfare of the union

controversy and serve to remove any erroneous impression which   may have be make elsewhere prejudicial to the right of the united states   it be among other reason with a view of prevent the embarrassment which   in our peculiar system of government impede and complicate negotiation involve   the territorial right of a state that i think it my duty as you have be   inform on a previous occasion to propose to the british government through   its minister at washington that early step should be take to adjust the point   of difference on the line of boundary from the entrance of lake

basis of their   intercourse with foreign power and it be hope they will tend to foster and   strengthen the commercial intercourse of the two country under the appropriation of the last session of congress an agent have be send   to germany for the purpose of promote the interest of our tobacco trade the commissioner appoint under the convention for the adjustment of claim   of citizen of the united states upon mexico having meet and organize at washington   in august last the paper in the possession of the government relate to those   claim be communicate to the board the claim not embrace by that convention   be now the subject of negotiation between the two government through the medium   of our minister at mexico nothing have occur to disturb the harmony of our relation with the different government of south america i regret however to be oblige to inform you   that the claim of our citizen upon the late republic of colombia have not   yet be satisfied by the separate government into which it have be resolve the charge d'affaires of brazil having express the intention of his government   not to prolong the treaty of 1828 it will cease to be obligatory upon either   party on the 12th day of december 1841 when the extensive commercial intercourse   between the united states and that vast empire will no long be regulate by   express stipulation it afford i pleasure to communicate to you that the government of chile have   enter into an agreement to indemnify the claimant in the case of the macectonian   for american property seize in 1819 and to add that information have also be   receive which justify the hope of an early adjustment of the remain claim   upon that government the commissioner appoint in pursuance of the convention between the united   states and texas for mark the boundary between they have accord to the   last report receive from our commissioner survey and establish the whole   extent of the boundary north along the western bank of the sabine river from   its entrance into the gulf of mexico to the 32nd degree of north latitude   the commission adjourn on the 16th of june last to reassemble on the 1st   of november for the purpose of establish accurately the intersection of the 32nd degree of latitude with the western bank of the sabine and the   meridian line thence to red river it be presume that the work will be   conclude in the present season the present sound condition of their finance and the success with which embarrassment   in regard to they at time apparently insurmountable have be overcome be   matter upon which the people and government of the united states may well congratulate   themselves an overflowing treasury however it may be regard as an evidence   of public prosperity be seldom conducive to the permanent welfare of any people   and experience have demonstrate its incompatibility with the salutary action   of political institution like those of the united states our safe reliance   for financial efficiency and independence have on the contrary been find to   consist in ample resource unencumbered with debt and in this respect the federal government occupy a singularly fortunate and truly enviable position when i enter upon the discharge of my official duty in march 1837 the   act for the distribution of the surplus revenue be in a course of rapid execution   nearly $ 28,000,000 of the public money be in pursuance of its provision   deposit with the state in the month of january april and july of that   year in may there occur a general suspension of specie payment by the bank   include with very few exception those in which the public money be deposit   and upon whose fidelity the government have unfortunately make itself dependent   for the revenue which have be collect from the people and be indispensable   to the public service this suspension and the excess in banking and commerce out of which it arise   and which be greatly aggravate by its occurrence make to a great extent   unavailable the principal part of the public money then on hand suspend the   collection of many million accrue on merchant bond and greatly reduce   the revenue arise from custom and the public land these effect have continue   to operate in various degree to the present period and in addition to the   decrease in the revenue thus produce two and a half million of duty have   be relinquish by two biennial reduction under the act of 1833 and probably   as much more upon the importation of iron for railroad by special legislation whilst such have be our condition for the last four year in relation to revenue   we have during the same period be subject to an unavoidable continuance   of large extraordinary expense necessarily grow out of past transaction   and which could not be immediately arrest without great prejudice to the public   interest of these the charge upon the treasurer in consequence of the cherokee   treaty alone without advert to other arise out of indian treaty have   already exceed $ 5,000,000 that for the prosecution of measure for the removal   of the seminole indians which be find in progress have be nearly 14   million and the public building have require the unusual sum of nearly three   million it afford i however great pleasure to be able to say that from the commencement   of this period to the present day every demand upon the government at home   or abroad have be promptly meet this have be do not only without create   a permanent debt or a resort to additional taxation in any form but in the   midst of a steadily progressive reduction of exist burden upon the people   leave still a considerable balance of available fund which will remain in   the treasury at the end of the year the small amount of treasury note not   exceed $ 4,500,000 still outstanding and less by 23 million than   the united states have in deposit with the state be compose of such only   as be not yet due or have not be present for payment they may be redeem   out of the accruing revenue if the expenditure do not exceed the amount within   which they may it be think be keep without prejudice to the public interest   and the revenue shall prove to be as large as may justly be anticipate among the reflection arise from the contemplation of these circumstance   one not the least gratifying be the consciousness that the government have   the resolution and the ability to adhere in every emergency to the sacred obligation   of law to execute all its contract accord to the requirement of the constitution   and thus to present when most need a rallying point by which the business   of the whole country might be bring back to a safe and unvarying standard&mdash;a   result vitally important as well to the interest as to the moral of the people   there can surely now be no difference of opinion in regard to the incalculable   evil that would have arise if the government at that critical moment have suffer   itself to be deter from uphold the only true standard of value either   by the pressure of adverse circumstance or the violence of unmerited denunciation   the manner in which the people sustain the performance of this duty be highly   honorable to their fortitude and patriotism it can not fail to stimulate their   agent to adhere under all circumstance to the line of duty and to satisfy   they of the safety with which a course really right and demand by a financial   crisis may in a community like our be pursue however apparently severe its   immediate operation the policy of the federal government in extinguish as rapidly as possible   the national debt and subsequently in resist every temptation to create   a new one deserve to be regard in the same favorable light among the many   objection to a national debt the certain tendency of public security to   concentrate ultimately in the coffer of foreign stockholder be one which be   every day gathering strength already have the resource of many of the state   and the future industry of their citizen be indefinitely mortgage to the   subject of european government to the amount of 12 million annually to   pay the constantly accruing interest on borrow money&mdash;a sum exceed half   the ordinary revenue of the whole united states the pretext which this relation   afford to foreigner to scrutinize the management of our domestic affair   if not actually to intermeddle with they present a subject for earnest attention   not to say of serious alarm fortunately the federal government with the exception   of an obligation enter into in behalf of the district of columbia which must   soon be discharge be wholly exempt from any such embarrassment it be also   as be believe the only government which having fully and faithfully pay   all its creditor have also relieve itself entirely from debt to maintain   a distinction so desirable and so honorable to our national character should   be an object of earnest solicitude never should a free people if it be possible   to avoid it expose themselves to the necessity of have to treat of the peace   the honor or the safety of the republic with the government of foreign creditor   who however well disposed they may be to cultivate with we in general friendly   relation be nevertheless by the law of their own condition make hostile to   the success and permanency of political institution like our most humiliating   may be the embarrassment consequent upon such a condition another objection   scarcely less formidable to the commencement of a new debt be its inevitable   tendency to increase in magnitude and to foster national extravagance he have   be an unprofitable observer of event who need at this day to be admonish   of the difficulty which a government habitually dependent on loan to sustain   its ordinary expenditure have to encounter in resist the influence constantly   exert in favor of additional loan by capitalist who enrich themselves   by government security for amount much exceed the money they actually   advance&mdash;a prolific source of individual aggrandizement in all borrowing country   by stockholder who seek their gain in the rise and fall of public stock   and by the selfish importunity of applicant for appropriation for work   avowedly for the accommodation of the public but the real object of which   be too frequently the advancement of private interest the known necessity   which so many of the state will be under to impose taxis for the payment of   the interest on their debt furnish an additional and very cogent reason why   the federal government should refrain from create a national debt by which   the people would be expose to double taxation for a similar object we possess   within ourselves ample resource for every emergency and we may be quite sure   that our citizen in no future exigency will be unwilling to supply the government   with all the mean ask for the defense of the country in time of peace there   can at all event be no justification for the creation of a permanent debt   by the federal government its limited range of constitutional duty may certainly   under such circumstance be perform without such a resort it have it be see   be avoid during four year of great fiscal difficulty than have exist   in a similar period since the adoption of the constitution and one also remarkable   for the occurrence of extraordinary cause of expenditure but to accomplish so desirable an object two thing be indispensable first   that the action of the federal government be keep within the boundary prescribe   by its founder and secondly that all appropriation for object admit   to be constitutional and the expenditure of they also be subject to a standard   of rigid but well consider and practical economy the first depend chiefly   on the people themselves&mdash;the opinion they form of the true construction of   the constitution and the confidence they repose in the political sentiment   of those they select as their representative in the federal legislature the   second rest upon the fidelity with which their more immediate representative   and other public functionary discharge the trust commit to they the duty   of economize the expense of the public service be admit on all hand   yet there be few subject upon which there exist a wide difference of opinion   than be constantly manifest in regard to the fidelity with which that duty   be discharge neither diversity of sentiment nor even mutual recrimination   upon a point in respect to which the public mind be so justly sensitive can   well be entirely avoid and least so at period of great political excitement   an intelligent people however seldom fail to arrive in the end at correct   conclusion in such a matter practical economy in the management of public   affair can have no adverse influence to contend with more powerful than a large   surplus revenue and the unusually large appropriation for 1837 may without   doubt independently of the extraordinary requisition for the public service   grow out of the state of our indian relation be in no inconsiderable degree   trace to this source the sudden and rapid distribution of the large surplus   then in the treasury and the equally sudden and unprecedentedly severe revulsion   in the commerce and business of the country point with unerre certainty   to a great and protract reduction of the revenue strengthen the propriety   of the early practicable reduction of the public expenditure but to change a system operate upon so large a surface and applicable to   such numerous and diversified interest and object be more than the work of   a day the attention of every department of the government be immediately and   in good faith direct to that end and have be so continued to the present   moment the estimate and appropriation for the year 1838 the first over   which i have any control be somewhat diminish the expenditure of 1839   be reduce $ 6,000,000 those of 1840 exclusive of disbursement for public   debt and trust claim will probably not exceed 22 1/2 million   be between two and three million less than those of the precede year and   nine or 10 million less than those of 1837 nor have it be find necessary   in order to produce this result to resort to the power confer by congress   of postpone certain class of the public work except by defer expenditure   for a short period upon a limited portion of they and which postponement terminate   some time since&mdash;at the moment the treasury department by further receipt from   the indebted bank become fully assured of its ability to meet they without   prejudice to the public service in other respect cause be in operation which   will it be believe justify a still further reduction without injury to any   important national interest the expense of sustain the troop employ   in florida have be gradually and greatly reduce through the persevere effort   of the war department and a reasonable hope may be entertain that the necessity   for military operation in that quarter will soon cease the removal of the   indians from within our settle border be nearly complete the pension list   one of the heavy charge upon the treasury be rapidly diminish   by death the most costly of our public building be either finished or nearly   so and we may i think safely promise ourselves a continue exemption from   border difficulty the available balance in the treasury on the 1st of january next be estimate   at $ 1,500,000 this sum with the expect receipt from all source during   the next year will it be believe be sufficient to enable the government   to meet every engagement and have a suitable balance in the treasury at the   end of the year if the remedial measure connect with the custom and the   public land heretofore recommend be adopt and the new appropriation by   congress shall not carry the expenditure beyond the official estimate the new system establish by congress for the safe keeping of the public money   prescribe the kind of currency to be receive for the public revenue and provide   additional guard and security against loss have now be several mouth   in operation although it might be premature upon an experience of such limited   duration to form a definite opinion in regard to the extent of its influence   in correct many evil under which the federal government and the country   have hitherto suffer especially those that have grow out of banking expansion   a depreciated currency and official defalcation yet it be but right to say   that nothing have occur in the practical operation of the system to weaken   in the slight degree but much to strengthen the confident anticipation   of its friend the ground of these have be heretofore so fully explain   as to require no recapitulation in respect to the facility and convenience   it afford in conduct the public service and the ability of the government   to discharge through its agency every duty attendant on the collection transfer   and disbursement of the public money with promptitude and success i can say   with confidence tha the apprehension of those who feel it to be their duty   to oppose its adoption have prove to be unfounded on the contrary this branch   of the fiscal affair of the government have be and it be believe may always   be thus carry on with every desirable facility and security a few change   and improvement in the detail of the system without affect any principle   involve in it will be submit to you by the secretary of the treasury and   will i be sure receive at your hand that attention to which they may on examination   be find to be entitle i have deem this brief summary of our fiscal affair necessary to the due   performance of a duty specially enjoin upon i by the constitution it will   serve also to illustrate more fully the principle by which i have be guide   in reference to two contest point in our public policy which be early   in their development and have be more important in their consequence than   any that have arise under our complicated and difficult yet admirable system   of government i allude to a national debt and a national bank it be in these   that the political contest by which the country have be agitate ever since   the adoption of the constitution in a great measure originate and there be   too much reason to apprehend that the conflict interest and oppose principle   thus marshal will continue as heretofore to produce similar if not aggravate   consequence come into office the declare enemy of both i have earnestly   endeavor to prevent a resort to either the consideration that a large public debt afford an apology and produce   in some degree a necessity also for resort to a system and extent of taxation   which be not only oppressive throughout but be likewise so apt to lead in the   end to the commission of that most odious of all offense against the principle   of republican government the prostitution of political power confer for   the general benefit to the aggrandizement of particular class and the gratification   of individual cupidity be alone sufficient independently of the weighty objection   which have already be urge to render its creation and existence the source   of bitter and unappeasable discord if we add to this its inevitable tendency   to produce and foster extravagant expenditure of the public money by which   a necessity be create for new loan and new burden on the people and finally   refer to the example of every government which have exist for proof how seldom   it be that the system when once adopt and implant in the policy of a country   have fail to expand itself until public credit be exhaust and the people   be no long able to endure its increase weight it seem impossible to   resist the conclusion that no benefit result from its career no extent   of conquest no accession of wealth to particular class nor any nor all its   combine advantage can counterbalance its ultimate but certain results&mdash;a   splendid government and an impoverished people if a national bank be as be undeniable repudiate by the framer of the   constitution as incompatible with the right of the state and the liberty   of the people if from the beginning it have be regard by large portion   of our citizen as come in direct collision with that great and vital amendment   of the constitution which declare that all power not confer by that instrument   on the general government be reserve to the state and to the people if it   have be view by they as the first great step in the march of latitudinous   construction which unchecked would render that sacred instrument of as little   value as an unwritten constitution dependent as it would alone be for its   meaning on the interested interpretation of a dominant party and afford   no security to the right of the minority&mdash;if such be undeniably the case what   rational ground could have be conceive for anticipate aught but determine   opposition to such an institution at the present day could a different result have be expect when the consequence which have   flow from its creation and particularly from its struggle to perpetuate   its existence have confirm in so strike a manner the apprehension of its   early opponent when it have be so clearly demonstrate that a concentrated   money power wield so vast a capital and combine such incalculable mean   of influence may in those peculiar conjuncture to which this government be   unavoidably expose prove an overmatch for the political power of the people   themselves when the true character of its capacity to regulate accord to   its will and its interest and the interest of its favorite the value and   production of the labor and property of every man in this extended country have   be so fully and fearfully develop when it be notorious that all class   of this great community have by mean of the power and influence it thus possess   be infect to madness with a spirit of heedless speculation when it have   be see that secure in the support of the combination of influence by which   it be surround it could violate its charter and set the law at defiance   with impunity and when too it have become most apparent that to believe that   such an accumulation of power can ever be grant without the certainty of   be abuse be to indulge in a fatal delusion?to avoid the necessity of a permanent debt and its inevitable consequence   i have advocate and endeavor to carry into effect the policy of confine   the appropriation for the public service to such object only as be clearly   within the constitutional authority of the federal government of exclude   from its expense those improvident and unauthorized grant of public money   for work of internal improvement which be so wisely arrest by the constitutional   interposition of my predecessor and which if they have not be so check   would long before this time have involve the finance of the general government   in embarrassment far great than those which be now experience by any of   the state of limit all our expenditure to that simple unostentatious   and economical administration of public affair which be alone consistent with   the character of our institution of collect annually from the custom   and the sale of public land a revenue fully adequate to defray all the expense   thus incur but under no pretense whatsoever to impose taxis upon the people   to a great amount than be actually necessary to the public service conduct   upon the principle i have state in lieu of a national bank or a dependence upon bank of any description for   the management of our fiscal affair i recommend the adoption of the system   which be now in successful operation that system afford every requisite facility   for the transaction of the pecuniary concern of the government will it be   confidently anticipate produce in other respect many of the benefit which   have be from time to time expect from the creation of a national bank but   which have never be realize avoid the manifold evil inseparable from such   an institution diminish to a great extent than could be accomplish by any   other measure of reform the patronage of the federal government&mdash;a wise policy   in all government but more especially so in one like our which work well   only in proportion as it be make to rely for its support upon the unbiased and   unadulterated opinion of its constituent do away forever all dependence on   corporate body either in the raising collect safekeeping or disburse   the public revenue and place the government equally above the temptation of   foster a dangerous and unconstitutional institution at home or the necessity   of adapt its policy to the view and interest of a still more formidable   money power abroad it be by adopt and carry out these principle under circumstance the   most arduous and discourage that the attempt have be make thus far successfully   to demonstrate to the people of the united states that a national bank at all   time and a national debt except it be incur at a period when the honor   and safety of the nation demand the temporary sacrifice of a policy which should   only be abandon in such exigency be not merely unnecessary but in direct   and deadly hostility to the principle of their government and to their own   permanent welfare the progress make in the development of these position appear in the precede   sketch of the past history and present state of the financial concern of the federal government the fact there state fully authorize the assertion that   all the purpose for which this government be institute have be accomplish   during four year of great pecuniary embarrassment than be ever before experience   in time of peace and in the face of opposition as formidable as any that be   ever before array against the policy of an administration that this have be   do when the ordinary revenue of the government be generally decrease   as well from the operation of the law as the condition of the country without   the creation of a permanent public debt or incur any liability other than   such as the ordinary resource of the government will speedily discharge and   without the agency of a national bank if this view of the proceeding of the government for the period it embrace   be warrant by the fact as they be know to exist if the army and navy have   be sustain to the full extent authorize by law and which congress deem   sufficient for the defense of the country and the protection of its right and   its honor if its civil and diplomatic service have be equally sustain if   ample provision have be make for the administration of justice and the execution   of the law if the claim upon public gratitude in behalf of the soldier of   the revolution have be promptly meet and faithfully discharge if there have   be no failure in defray the very large expenditure grow out of that   long continue and salutary policy of peacefully remove the indians to region   of comparative safety and prosperity if the public faith have at all time and   everywhere be most scrupulously maintain by a prompt discharge of the numerous   extend and diversified claim on the treasury&mdash;if all these great and permanent   object with many other that might be state have for a series of year   mark by peculiar obstacle and difficulty be successfully accomplish   without a resort to a permanent debt or the aid of a national bank have we   not a right to expect that a policy the object of which have be to sustain   the public service independently of either of these fruitful source of discord   will receive the final sanction of a people whose unbiased and fairly elicited   judgment upon public affair be never ultimately wrong?that embarrassment in the pecuniary concern of individual of unexampled   extent and duration have recently exist in this as in other commercial nation   be undoubtedly true to suppose it necessary now to trace these reverse to   their source would be a reflection on the intelligence of my fellow citizen   whatever may have be the obscurity in which the subject be involve during   the early stage of the revulsion there can not now be many by whom the whole   question be not fully understand not deem it within the constitutional power of the general government to   repair private loss sustain by reverse in business have no connection   with the public service either by direct appropriation from the treasury or   by special legislation design to secure exclusive privilege and immunity   to individual or class in preference to or at the expense of the great majority   necessarily debar from any participation in they no attempt to do so have   be either make recommend or encourage by the present executive it be believe however that the great purpose for the attainment of which   the federal government be institute have not be lose sight of intrusted   only with certain limited power cautiously enumerate distinctly specify   and define with a precision and clearness which would seem to defy misconstruction   it have be my constant aim to confine myself within the limit so clearly mark   out and so carefully guard having always be of opinion that the good preservative   of the union of the state be to be find in a total abstinence from the exercise   of all doubtful power on the part of the federal government rather than in   attempt to assume they by a loose construction of the constitution or an ingenious   perversion of its word i have endeavor to avoid recommend any measure   which i have reason to apprehend would in the opinion even of a considerable   minority of my fellow citizen be regard as trench on the right of the state or the provision of the hallowed instrument of our union view the   aggregate power of the federal government as a voluntary concession of the state it seem to i that such only should be exercise as be at the time   intend to be give i have be strengthen too in the propriety of this course by the conviction   that all effort to go beyond this tend only to produce dissatisfaction and   distrust to excite jealousy and to provoke resistance instead of add   strength to the federal government even when successful they must ever prove   a source of incurable weakness by alienate a portion of those whose adhesion   be indispensable to the great aggregate of united strength and whose voluntary   attachment be in my estimation far more essential to the efficiency of a government   strong in the good of all possible strength&mdash;the confidence and attachment of   all those who make up its constituent element thus believe it have be my purpose to secure to the whole people and to   every member of the confederacy by general salutary and equal law alone   the benefit of those republican institution which it be the end and aim of   the constitution to establish and the impartial influence of which be in my   judgment indispensable to their preservation i can not bring myself to believe   that the last happiness of the people the prosperity of the state   or the permanency of their union can be maintain by give preference or priority   to any class of citizen in the distribution of benefit or privilege or by   the adoption of measure which enrich one portion of the union at the expense   of another nor can i see in the interference of the federal government with   the local legislation and reserved right of the state a remedy for present   or a security against future danger the first and assuredly not the least important step toward relieve the   country from the condition into which it have be plunge by excess in trade   banking and credit of all kind be to place the business transaction of   the government itself on a solid basis give and receive in all case value   for value and neither countenance nor encouraging in other that delusive   system of credit from which it have be find so difficult to escape and which   have leave nothing behind it but the wreck that mark its fatal career that the financial affair of the government be now and have be during the   whole period of these wide spread difficulty conduct with a strict and   invariable regard to this great fundamental principle and that by the assumption   and maintenance of the stand thus take on the very threshold of the approach   crisis more than by any other cause or cause whatever the community at large   have be shield from the incalculable evil of a general and indefinite suspension   of specie payment and a consequent annihilation for the whole period it might   have last of a just and invariable standard of value will it be believe   at this period scarcely be question a steady adherence on the part of the government to the policy which have produce   such salutary result aid by judicious state legislation and what be not   less .important by the industry enterprise perseverance and economy of the   american people can not fail to raise the whole country at an early period   to a state of solid and endure prosperity not subject to be again overthrow   by the suspension of bank or the explosion of a bloated credit system it be   for the people and their representative to decide whether or not the permanent   welfare of the country which all good citizen equally desire however widely   they may differ as to the mean of its accomplishment shall be in this way   secure or whether the management of the pecuniary concern of the government   and by consequence to a great extent those of individual also shall be carry   back to a condition of thing which foster those contraction and expansion   of the currency and those reckless abuse of credit from the baleful effect   of which the country have so deeply suffered&mdash;a return that can promise in the   end no well result than to reproduce the embarrassment the government have   experience and to remove from the shoulder of the present to those of fresh   victim the bitter fruit of that spirit of speculative enterprise to which   our countryman be so liable and upon which the lesson of experience be so   unavaile the choice be an important one and i sincerely hope that it may   be wisely make a report from the secretary of war present a detailed view of the affair   of that department accompany this communication the desultory duty connect with the removal of the indians in which the   army have be constantly engage on the northern and western frontier and in   florida have render it impracticable to carry into full effect the plan recommend   by the secretary for improve its discipline in every instance where the regiment   have be concentrate they have make great progress and the good result may   be anticipate from a continuance of this system during the last season a part   of the troop have be employ in remove indians from the interior to the   territory assign they in the west&mdash;a duty which they have perform efficiently   and with praiseworthy humanity&mdash;and that portion of they which have be station   in florida continue active operation there throughout the heat of summer the policy of the united states in regard to the indians of which a succinct   account be give in my message of 1838 and of the wisdom and expediency of   which i be fully satisfied have be continue in active operation throughout   the whole period of my administration since the spring of 1837 more than 40,000   indians have be remove to their new home west of the mississippi and i   be happy to add that all account concur in represent the result of this   measure as eminently beneficial to that people the emigration of the seminoles alone have be attend with serious difficulty   and occasion bloodshed hostility having be commence by the indians in   florida under the apprehension that they would be compel by force to comply   with their treaty stipulation the execution of the treaty of paynes landing   sign in 1832 but not ratify until 1834 be postpone at the solicitation   of the indians until 1836 when they again renew their agreement to remove   peaceably to their new home in the west in the face of this solemn and renew   compact they break their faith and commenced hostility by the massacre of   major dade 's command the murder of their agent general thompson and other   act of cruel treachery when this alarming and unexpected intelligence reach   the seat of government every effort appear to have be make to reenforce   general clinch who command the troop then in florida general eustis be   dispatch with reenforcement from charleston troop be call out from   alabama tennessee and georgia and general scott be send to take the command   with ample power and ample mean at the first alarm general gaines organize   a force at new orleans and without wait for order land in florida where   he deliver over the troop he have bring with he to general scott governor call be subsequently appoint to conduct a summer campaign and   at the close of it be replace by general jesup these event and change take   place under the administration of my predecessor notwithstanding the exertion   of the experienced officer who have command there for eighteen month on enter   upon the administration of the government i find the territory of florida a   prey to indian atrocity a strenuous effort be immediately make to bring   those hostility to a close and the army under general jesup be reenforce   until it amount to 10,000 man and furnish with abundant supply of every   description in this campaign a great number of the enemy be capture and   destroy but the character of the contest only be change the indians having   be defeat in every engagement disperse in small band throughout the country   and become an enterprising formidable and ruthless bandit general taylor   who succeed general jesup use his good exertion to subdue they and be   second in his effort by the officer under his command but he too fail   to protect the territory from their depredation by an act of signal and cruel   treachery they break the truce make with they by general macgrab who be send   from washington for the purpose of carry into effect the express wish   of congress and have continue their devastation ever since general armistead   who be in florida when general taylor leave the army by permission assume   the command and after active summer operation be meet by proposition for   peace and from the fortunate coincidence of the arrival in florida at the same   period of a delegation from the seminoles who be happily settle west of the   mississippi and be now anxious to persuade their countryman to join they there   hope be for some time entertain that the indians might be induce to leave   the territory without further difficulty these hope have prove fallacious   and hostility have be renew throughout the whole of the territory that   this contest have endure so long be to be attribute to cause beyond the control   of the government experienced general have have the command of the troop   officer and soldier have alike distinguish themselves for their activity   patience and endure courage the army have be constantly furnish with   supply of every description and we must look for the cause which have so   long procrastinate the issue of the contest in the vast extent of the theater   of hostility the almost insurmountable obstacle present by the nature   of the country the climate and the wily character of the savage the site for marine hospital on the river and lake which i be authorize   to select and cause to be purchase have all be designate but the appropriation   not prove sufficient conditional arrangement only have be make for their   acquisition it be for congress to decide whether these conditional purchase   shall be sanction and the humane intention of the law carry into full effect the navy as will appear from the accompany report of the secretary have   be usefully and honorably employ in the protection of our commerce and citizen   in the mediterranean the pacific on the coast of brazil and in the gulf of   mexico a small squadron consist of the frigate constellation and the sloop   of war boston under commodore kearney be now on its way to the china and indian   sea for the purpose of attend to our interest in that quarter and commander   aulick in the sloop of war yorktown have be instruct to visit the sandwich   and society island the coast of new zealand and japan together with other   port and island frequent by our whale ship for the purpose of give they   countenance and protection should they be require other small vessel have   be and still be employ in prosecute the survey of the coast of the united   states direct by various act of congress and those which have be complete   will shortly be lay before you the explore expedition at the late date be prepare to leave the bay   of islands new zealand in further prosecution of object which have thus far   be successfully accomplish the discovery of a new continent which be   first see in latitude 66 2 south longitude 154 27 east and afterwards   in latitude 66 31 south longitude 153 40 east by lieutenants   wilkes and hudson for an extent of 1,800 mile but on which they be prevent   from land by vast body of ice which encompass it be one of the honorable   result of the enterprise lieutenant wilkes bear testimony to the zeal and   good conduct of his officer and man and it be but justice to that officer   to state that he appear to have perform the duty assign he with an ardor   ability and perseverance which give every assurance of an honorable issue to   the undertaking the report of the postmaster general herewith transmit will exhibit the   service of that department the past year and its present condition the transportation   have be maintain during the year to the full extent authorize by the exist   law some improvement have be effect which the public interest seem   urgently to demand but not involve any material additional expenditure the   contractor have generally perform their engagement with fidelity the postmaster   with few exception have render their account and pay their quarterly balance   with promptitude and the whole service of the department have maintain the   efficiency for which it have for several year be distinguish the act of congress establish new mail route and require more expensive   service on other and the increase want of the country have for three year   past carry the expenditure something beyond the accruing revenue the excess   having be meet until the past year by the surplus which have previously accumulate   that surplus having be exhaust and the anticipated increase in the revenue   not having be realize owe to the depression in the commercial business   of the country the finance of the department exhibit a small deficiency at   the close of the last fiscal year its resource however be ample and the   reduce rate of compensation for the transportation service which may be expect   on the future letting from the general reduction of price with the increase   of revenue that may reasonably be anticipate from the revival of commercial   activity must soon place the finance of the department in a prosperous condition consider the unfavorable circumstance which have exist during the past   year it be a gratifying result that the revenue have not decline as compare   with the precede year but on the contrary exhibit a small increase the   circumstance refer to having have no other effect than to check the expect   income it will be see that the postmaster general suggest certain improvement in   the establishment design to reduce the weight of the mail cheapen the transportation   insure great regularity in the service and secure a considerable reduction   in the rate of letter postage&mdash;an object highly desirable the subject be one   of general interest to the community and be respectfully recommend to your   consideration the suppression of the african slave trade have receive the continued attention   of the government the brig dolphin and schooner grampus have be employ   during the last season on the coast of africa for the purpose of prevent   such portion of that trade as be say to be prosecute under the american   flag after cruise off those part of the coast most usually resort to by   slaver until the commencement of the rainy season these vessel return to   the united states for supply and have since be dispatch on a similar   service from the report of the command officer it appear that the trade be now   principally carry on under portuguese color and they express the opinion   that the apprehension of their presence on the slave coast have in a great degree   arrest the prostitution of the american flag to this inhuman purpose it be   hope that by continue to maintain this force in that quarter and by the exertion   of the officer in command much will be do to put a stop to whatever portion   of this traffic may have be carry on under the american flag and to prevent   its use in a trade which while it violate the law be equally an outrage   on the right of other and the feeling of humanity the effort of the several government who be anxiously seek to suppress this traffic must however   be direct against the facility afford by what be now recognize as legitimate   commercial pursuit before that object can be fully accomplish supply of provision water cask merchandise and article connect with   the prosecution of the slave trade be it be understand freely carry by   vessel of different nation to the slave factory and the effect of the   factor be transport openly from one slave station to another without interruption   or punishment by either of the nation to which they belong engage in the commerce   of that region i submit to your judgment whether this government having be   the first to prohibit by adequate penalty the slave trade the first to declare   it piracy should not be the first also to forbid to its citizen all trade   with the slave factory on the coast of africa give an example to all nation   in this respect which if fairly follow can not fail to produce the most effective   result in break up those dens of iniquity
to the house of representatives of the united states

 i think proper to communicate to the house of representatives in further answer to their resolution of the 21st ultimo the correspondence which have since occur between the secretary of state and the british minister on the same subject

 hon john forsyth etc

 sir i have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th instant in which in reply to a letter which i have address to you on the 13th you acquaint i that the president be not prepared to comply with my demand for the liberation of mr. alexander mcleod of upper canada now imprison at lockport in the state of new york on a pretended charge of murder and arson as having be engage in the destruction of the piratical steamboat caroline on the 29th of december 1837

 i learn with deep regret that such be the decision of the president of the united states for i can not but foresee the very grave and serious consequence that must ensue if besides the injury already inflict upon mr. mcleod of a vexatious and unjust imprisonment any further harm should be do to he in the progress of this extraordinary proceeding

 i have lose no time in forward to her majesty&#39;s government in england the correspondence that have take place and i shall await the further order of her majesty&#39;s government with respect to the important question which that correspondence involve

 but i feel it my duty not to close this communication without likewise testify my vast regret and surprise at the expression which i find repeat in your letter with reference to the destruction of the steamboat caroline i have confidently hope that the first erroneous impression of the character of that event impose upon the mind of the united states government by partial and exaggerated representation would long since have be efface by a more strict and accurate examination of the fact such an investigation must even yet i be willing to believe lead the united states government to the same conviction with which her majesty&#39;s authority on the spot be impressed&mdash;that the act be one in the strict sense of self defense render absolutely necessary by the circumstance of the occasion for the safety and protection of her majesty&#39;s subject and justify by the same motive and principle which upon similar and well know occasion have govern the conduct of illustrious officer of the united states the steamboat caroline be a hostile vessel engage in piratical war against her majesty&#39;s people hire from her owner for that express purpose and know to be so beyond the possibility of doubt the place where the vessel be destroy be nominally it be true within the territory of a friendly power but the friendly power have be deprive through overbear piratical violence of the use of its proper authority over that portion of territory the authority of new york have not even be able to prevent the artillery of the state from be carry off publicly at midday to be use as instrument of war against her majesty&#39;s subject it be under such circumstance which it be to be hope will never recur that the vessel be attack by a party of her majesty&#39;s people capture and destroy a remonstrance against the act in question have be address by the united states to her majesty&#39;s government in england i be not authorize to pronounce the decision of her majesty&#39;s government upon that remonstrance but i have feel myself bind to record in the meantime the above opinion in order to protest in the most solemn manner against the spirited and loyal conduct of a party of her majesty&#39;s officer and people be qualified through an unfortunate misapprehension as i believe of the fact with the appellation of outrage or of murder

 i avail myself of this occasion to renew to you the assurance of my distinguished consideration

 i avail myself of the occasion to renew to you the assurance of my distinguished consideration

 john forsyth
in 1839 59 african captive who be illegally capture revolt and take control of the spanish ship la amistad on which they be travel outside of cuba a united states navy ship seize la amistad off of long island and take the africans to connecticut where they fight the spanish request to be return to spain as property of the country roger sherman baldwin and john quincy adams win this landmark case for the africans who eventually be able to return to africa

call from a retirement which i have suppose be to continue for the residue of my life to fill the chief executive office of this great and free nation i appear before you fellow citizen to take the oath which the constitution prescribe as a necessary qualification for the performance of its duty and in obedience to a custom coeval with our government and what i believe to be your expectation i proceed to present to you a summary of the principle which will govern i in the discharge of the duty which i shall be call upon to perform

 it be the remark of a roman consul in an early period of that celebrate republic that a most striking contrast be observable in the conduct of candidate for office of power and trust before and after obtain they they seldom carry out in the latter case the pledge and promise make in the former however much the world may have improve in many respect in the lapse of upward of two thousand year since the remark be make by the virtuous and indignant roman i fear that a strict examination of the annal of some of the modern elective government would develop similar instance of violate confidence

 although the fiat of the people have go forth proclaim i the chief magistrate of this glorious union nothing upon their part remain to be do it may be think that a motive may exist to keep up the delusion under which they may be suppose to have act in relation to my principle and opinion and perhaps there may be some in this assembly who have come here either prepare to condemn those i shall now deliver or approve they to doubt the sincerity with which they be now utter but the lapse of a few month will confirm or dispel their fear the outline of principle to govern and measure to be adopt by an administration not yet begin will soon be exchange for immutable history and i shall stand either exonerate by my countryman or class with the mass of those who promise that they might deceive and flatter with the intention to betray however strong may be my present purpose to realize the expectation of a magnanimous and confide people i too well understand the dangerous temptation to which i shall be expose from the magnitude of the power which it have be the pleasure of the people to commit to my hand not to place my chief confidence upon the aid of that almighty power which have hitherto protect i and enable i to bring to favorable issue other important but still greatly inferior trust heretofore confide to i by my country

 the broad foundation upon which our constitution rest be the people&mdash;a breath of theirs having make as a breath can unmake change or modify it&mdash;it can be assign to none of the great division of government but to that of democracy if such be its theory those who be call upon to administer it must recognize as its lead principle the duty of shape their measure so as to produce the great good to the great number but with these broad admission if we would compare the sovereignty acknowledge to exist in the mass of our people with the power claim by other sovereignty even by those which have be consider most purely democratic we shall find a most essential difference all other lay claim to power limit only by their own will the majority of our citizen on the contrary possess a sovereignty with an amount of power precisely equal to that which have be grant to they by the party to the national compact and nothing beyond we admit of no government by divine right believe that so far as power be concern the beneficent creator have make no distinction amongst man that all be upon an equality and that the only legitimate right to govern be an express grant of power from the governed the constitution of the united states be the instrument contain this grant of power to the several department compose the government on an examination of that instrument it will be find to contain declaration of power grant and of power withhold the latter be also susceptible of division into power which the majority have the right to grant but which they do not think proper to intrust to their agent and that which they could not have grant not be possess by themselves in other word there be certain right possess by each individual american citizen which in his compact with the other he have never surrender some of they indeed he be unable to surrender be in the language of our system unalienable the boasted privilege of a roman citizen be to he a shield only against a petty provincial ruler whilst the proud democrat of athens would console himself under a sentence of death for a suppose violation of the national faith&mdash;which no one understand and which at time be the subject of the mockery of all&mdash;or the banishment from his home his family and his country with or without an alleged cause that it be the act not of a single tyrant or hated aristocracy but of his assemble countryman far different be the power of our sovereignty it can interfere with no one&#39;s faith prescribe form of worship for no one&#39;s observance inflict no punishment but after well ascertain guilt the result of investigation under rule prescribe by the constitution itself these precious privilege and those scarcely less important of give expression to his thought and opinion either by writing or speak unrestrained but by the liability for injury to other and that of a full participation in all the advantage which flow from the government the acknowledge property of all the american citizen derive from no charter grant by his fellow man he claim they because he be himself a man fashion by the same almighty hand as the rest of his specie and entitle to a full share of the blessing with which he have endow they notwithstanding the limited sovereignty possess by the people of the united stages and the restricted grant of power to the government which they have adopt enough have be give to accomplish all the object for which it be create it have be find powerful in war and hitherto justice have be administer and intimate union effect domestic tranquillity preserve and personal liberty secure to the citizen as be to be expect however from the defect of language and the necessarily sententious manner in which the constitution be write dispute have arise as to the amount of power which it have actually grant or be intend to grant

 this be more particularly the case in relation to that part of the instrument which treat of the legislative branch and not only as regard the exercise of power claim under a general clause give that body the authority to pass all law necessary to carry into effect the specified power but in relation to the latter also it be however consolatory to reflect that most of the instance of allege departure from the letter or spirit of the constitution have ultimately receive the sanction of a majority of the people and the fact that many of our statesman most distinguished for talent and patriotism have be at one time or other of their political career on both side of each of the most warmly dispute question force upon we the inference that the error if error there be be attributable to the intrinsic difficulty in many instance of ascertain the intention of the framer of the constitution rather than the influence of any sinister or unpatriotic motive but the great danger to our institution do not appear to i to be in a usurpation by the government of power not grant by the people but by the accumulation in one of the department of that which be assign to other limit as be the power which have be grant still enough have be grant to constitute a despotism if concentrate in one of the department this danger be greatly heighten as it have be always observable that man be less jealous of encroachment of one department upon another than upon their own reserved right when the constitution of the united states first come from the hand of the convention which form it many of the stern republican of the day be alarm at the extent of the power which have be grant to the federal government and more particularly of that portion which have be assign to the executive branch there be in it feature which appear not to be in harmony with their idea of a simple representative democracy or republic and know the tendency of power to increase itself particularly when exercise by a single individual prediction be make that at no very remote period the government would terminate in virtual monarchy it would not become i to say that the fear of these patriot have be already realize but as i sincerely believe that the tendency of measure and of men&#39;s opinion for some year past have be in that direction it be i conceive strictly proper that i should take this occasion to repeat the assurance i have heretofore give of my determination to arrest the progress of that tendency if it really exist and restore the government to its pristine health and vigor as far as this can be effect by any legitimate exercise of the power place in my hand

 i proceed to state in as summary a manner as i can my opinion of the source of the evil which have be so extensively complain of and the corrective which may be apply some of the former be unquestionably to be find in the defect of the constitution other in my judgment be attributable to a misconstruction of some of its provision of the former be the eligibility of the same individual to a second term of the presidency the sagacious mind of mr. jefferson early see and lament this error and attempt have be make hitherto without success to apply the amendatory power of the states to its correction as however one mode of correction be in the power of every president and consequently in mine it would be useless and perhaps invidious to enumerate the evil of which in the opinion of many of our fellow citizen this error of the sage who frame the constitution may have be the source and the bitter fruit which we be still to gather from it if it continue to disfigure our system it may be observe however as a general remark that republic can commit no great error than to adopt or continue any feature in their system of government which may be calculate to create or increase the lover of power in the bosom of those to whom necessity oblige they to commit the management of their affair and surely nothing be more likely to produce such a state of mind than the long continuance of an office of high trust nothing can be more corrupting nothing more destructive of all those noble feeling which belong to the character of a devoted republican patriot when this corrupt passion once take possession of the human mind like the love of gold it become insatiable it be the never die worm in his bosom grow with his growth and strengthen with the decline year of its victim if this be true it be the part of wisdom for a republic to limit the service of that officer at least to whom she have intrust the management of her foreign relation the execution of her law and the command of her army and navy to a period so short as to prevent his forgetting that he be the accountable agent not the principal the servant not the master until an amendment of the constitution can be effect public opinion may secure the desire object i give my aid to it by renew the pledge heretofore give that under no circumstance will i consent to serve a second term

 but if there be danger to public liberty from the acknowledge defect of the constitution in the want of limit to the continuance of the executive power in the same hand there be i apprehend not much less from a misconstruction of that instrument as it regard the power actually give i can not conceive that by a fair construction any or either of its provision would be find to constitute the president a part of the legislative power it can not be claim from the power to recommend since although enjoin as a duty upon he it be a privilege which he hold in common with every other citizen and although there may be something more of confidence in the propriety of the measure recommend in the one case than in the other in the obligation of ultimate decision there can be no difference in the language of the constitution all the legislative power which it grant be vest in the congress of the united states it would be a solecism in language to say that any portion of these be not include in the whole

 it may be say indeed that the constitution have give to the executive the power to annul the act of the legislative body by refuse to they his assent so a similar power have necessarily result from that instrument to the judiciary and yet the judiciary form no part of the legislature there be it be true this difference between these grant of power the executive can put his negative upon the act of the legislature for other cause than that of want of conformity to the constitution whilst the judiciary can only declare void those which violate that instrument but the decision of the judiciary be final in such a case whereas in every instance where the veto of the executive be apply it may be overcome by a vote of two third of both houses of congress the negative upon the act of the legislative by the executive authority and that in the hand of one individual would seem to be an incongruity in our system like some other of asimilar character however it appear to be highly expedient and if use only with the forbearance and in the spirit which be intend by its author it may be productive of great good and be find one of the good safeguard to the union at the period of the formation of the constitution the principle do not appear to have enjoy much favor in the state government it exist but in two and in one of these there be a plural executive if we would search for the motive which operate upon the purely patriotic and nlightene assembly which frame the constitution for the adoption of a provision so apparently repugnant to the lead democratic principle that the majority should govern we must reject the idea that they anticipate from it any benefit to the ordinary course of legislation they know too well the high degree of intelligence which exist among the people and the enlightened character of the state legislature not to have the full confidence that the two body elect by they would be worthy representative of such constituent and of course that they would require no aid in conceiving and mature the measure which the circumstance of the country might require and it be preposterous to suppose that a thought could for a moment have be entertain that the president place at the capital in the center of the country could well understand the want and wish of the people than their own immediate representative who spend a part of every year among they live with they often labor with they and bind to they by the triple tie of interest duty and affection to assist or control congress then in its ordinary legislation could not i conceive have be the motive for confer the veto power on the president this argument acquire additional force from the fact of its never having be thus use by the first six president and two of they be member of the convention one preside over its deliberation and the other bear a large share in consummate the labor of that august body than any other person but if bill be never return to congress by either of the president above refer to upon the ground of their be inexpedient or not as well adapt as they might be to the want of the people the veto be apply upon that of want of conformity to the constitution or because error have be commit from a too hasty enactment

 there be another ground for the adoption of the veto principle which have probably more influence in recommend it to the convention than any other i refer to the security which it give to the just and equitable action of the legislature upon all part of the union it could not but have occur to the convention that in a country so extensive embrace so great a variety of soil and climate and consequently of product and which from the same cause must ever exhibit a great difference in the amount of the population of its various section call for a great diversity in the employment of the people that the legislation of the majority might not always justly regard the right and interest of the minority and that act of this character might be pass under an express grant by the word of the constitution and therefore not within the competency of the judiciary to declare void that however enlightened and patriotic they might suppose from past experience the member of congress might be and however largely partake in the general of the liberal feeling of the people it be impossible to expect that body so constituted should not sometimes be control by local interest and sectional feeling it be proper therefore to provide some umpire from whose situation and mode of appointment more independence and freedom from such influence might be expect such a one be afford by the executive department constitute by the constitution a person elect to that high office have his constituent in every section state and subdivision of the union must consider himself bind by the most solemn sanction to guard protect and defend the right of all and of every portion great or small from the injustice and oppression of the rest i consider the veto power therefore give by the constitution to the executive of the united states solely as a conservative power to be use only first to protect the constitution from violation secondly the people from the effect of hasty legislation where their will have be probably disregard or not well understand and thirdly to prevent the effect of combination violative of the right of minority in reference to the second of these object i may observe that i consider it the right and privilege of the people to decide dispute point of the constitution arise from the general grant of power to congress to carry into effect the power expressly give and i believe with mr. madison that repeat recognition under varied circumstance in act of the legislative executive and judicial branch of the government accompany by indication in different mode of the concurrence of the general will of the nation as afford to the president sufficient authority for his consider such dispute point as settle

 upward of half a century have elapse since the adoption of the present form of government it would be an object more highly desirable than the gratification of the curiosity of speculative statesman if its precise situation could be ascertain a fair exhibit make of the operation of each of its department of the power which they respectively claim and exercise of the collision which have occur between they or between the whole government and those of the states or either of they we could then compare our actual condition after fifty years&#39 trial of our system with what it be in the commencement of its operation and ascertain whether the prediction of the patriot who oppose its adoption or the confident hope of its advocate have be well realize the great dread of the former seem to have be that the reserved power of the states would be absorb by those of the federal government and a consolidated power establish leave to the states the shadow only of that independent action for which they have so zealously contend and on the preservation of which they rely as the last hope of liberty without deny that the result to which they look with so much apprehension be in the way of be realize it be obvious that they do not clearly see the mode of its accomplishment the general government have seize upon none of the reserved right of the states as far as any open warfare may have go the state authority have amply maintain their right to a casual observer our system present no appearance of discord between the different member which compose it even the addition of many new one have produce no jarring they move in their respective orbit in perfect harmony with the central head and with each other but there be still an undercurrent at work by which if not seasonably check the bad apprehension of our antifederal patriot will be realize and not only will the state authority be overshadow by the great increase of power in the executive department of the general government but the character of that government if not its designation be essentially and radically change this state of thing have be in part effect by cause inherent in the constitution and in part by the never fail tendency of political power to increase itself by make the president the sole distributer of all the patronage of the government the framer of the constitution do not appear to have anticipate at how short a period it would become a formidable instrument to control the free operation of the state government of trifle importance at first it have early in mr. jefferson&#39;s administration become so powerful as to create great alarm in the mind of that patriot from the potent influence it might exert in control the freedom of the elective franchise if such could have then be the effect of its influence how much great must be the danger at this time quadruple in amount as it certainly be and more completely under the control of the executive will than their construction of their power allow or the forbear character of all the early presidents permit they to make but it be not by the extent of its patronage alone that the executive department have become dangerous but by the use which it appear may be make of the appoint power to bring under its control the whole revenue of the country the constitution have declare it to be the duty of the president to see that the law be execute and it make he the commander in chief of the armies and navy of the united states if the opinion of the most approve writer upon that specie of mixed government which in modern europe be term monarchy in contradistinction to despotism be correct there be want no other addition to the power of our chief magistrate to stamp a monarchical character on our government but the control of the public finance and to i it appear strange indeed that anyone should doubt that the entire control which the president possess over the officer who have the custody of the public money by the power of removal with or without cause do for all mischievous purpose at least virtually subject the treasure also to his disposal the first roman emperor in his attempt to seize the sacred treasure silence the opposition of the officer to whose charge it have be commit by a significant allusion to his sword by a selection of political instrument for the care of the public money a reference to their commission by a president would be quite as effectual an argument as that of caesar to the roman knight i be not insensible of the great difficulty that exist in draw a proper plan for the safe- keeping and disbursement of the public revenue and i know the importance which have be attach by man of great ability and patriotism to the divorce as it be call of the treasury from the banking institution it be not the divorce which be complain of but the unhallowed union of the treasury with the executive department which have create such extensive alarm to this danger to our republican institution and that create by the influence give to the executive through the instrumentality of the federal officer i propose to apply all the remedy which may be at my command it be certainly a great error in the framer of the constitution not to have make the officer at the head of the treasury department entirely independent of the executive he should at least have be removable only upon the demand of the popular branch of the legislature i have determine never to remove a secretary of the treasury without communicate all the circumstance attend such removal to both houses of congress

 the influence of the executive in control the freedom of the elective franchise through the medium of the public officer can be effectually check by renew the prohibition publish by mr. jefferson forbid their interference in election far than give their own vote and their own independence secure by an assurance of perfect immunity in exercise this sacred privilege of freeman under the dictate of their own unbiased judgment never with my consent shall an officer of the people compensate for his service out of their pocket become the pliant instrument of executive will

 there be no part of the mean place in the hand of the executive which might be use with great effect for unhallowed purpose than the control of the public press the maxim which our ancestor derive from the mother country that the freedom of the press be the great bulwark of civil and religious liberty be one of the most precious legacy which they have leave we we have learn too from our own as well as the experience of other country that golden shackle by whomsoever or by whatever pretense impose be as fatal to it as the iron bond of despotism the press in the necessary employment of the government should never be use to clear the guilty or to varnish crime a decent and manly examination of the act of the government should be not only tolerate but encourage

 upon another occasion i have give my opinion at some length upon the impropriety of executive interference in the legislation of congress&mdash;that the article in the constitution make it the duty of the president to communicate information and authorize he to recommend measure be not intend to make he the source in legislation and in particular that he should never be look to for scheme of finance it would be very strange indeed that the constitution should have strictly forbid one branch of the legislature from interfere in the origination of such bill and that it should be consider proper that an altogether different department of the government should be permit to do so some of our good political maxim and opinion have be draw from our parent isle there be other however which can not be introduce in our system without singular incongruity and the production of much mischief and this i conceive to be one no matter in which of the house of parliament a bill may originate nor by whom introduced&mdash;a minister or a member of the opposition&mdash;by the fiction of law or rather of constitutional principle the sovereign be suppose to have prepare it agreeably to his will and then submit it to parliament for their advice and consent now the very reverse be the case here not only with regard to the principle but the form prescribe by the constitution the principle certainly assign to the only body constitute by the constitution the legislative body the power to make law and the form even direct that the enactment should be ascribe to they the senate in relation to revenue bill have the right to propose amendment and so have the executive by the power give he to return they to the house of representatives with his objection it be in his power also to propose amendment in the exist revenue law suggest by his observation upon their defective or injurious operation but the delicate duty of devise scheme of revenue should be leave where the constitution have place it&mdash;with the immediate representative of the people for similar reason the mode of keep the public treasure should be prescribe by they and the far remove it may be from the control of the executive the more wholesome the arrangement and the more in accordance with republican principle

 connect with this subject be the character of the currency the idea of make it exclusively metallic however well intend appear to i to be fraught with more fatal consequence than any other scheme have no relation to the personal right of the citizen that have ever be devise if any single scheme could produce the effect of arrest at once that mutation of condition by which thousand of our most indigent fellow citizen by their industry and enterprise be raise to the possession of wealth that be the one if there be one measure well calculate than another to produce that state of thing so much deprecate by all true republican by which the rich be daily add to their hoard and the poor sink deeply into penury it be an exclusive metallic currency or if there be a process by which the character of the country for generosity and nobleness of feeling may be destroy by the great increase and neck toleration of usury it be an exclusive metallic currency

 amongst the other duty of a delicate character which the president be call upon to perform be the supervision of the government of the territories of the united states those of they which be destine to become member of our great political family be compensate by their rapid progress from infancy to manhood for the partial and temporary deprivation of their political right it be in this district only where american citizen be to be find who under a settle policy be deprive of many important political privilege without any inspiring hope as to the future their only consolation under circumstance of such deprivation be that of the devoted exterior guard of a camp&mdash;that their suffering secure tranquillity and safety within be there any of their countryman who would subject they to great sacrifice to any other humiliation than those essentially necessary to the security of the object for which they be thus separate from their fellow citizen be their right alone not to be guarantee by the application of those great principle upon which all our constitution be found we be tell by the great of british orator and statesman that at the commencement of the war of the revolution the most stupid man in england speak of their american subject be there indeed citizen of any of our states who have dream of their subject in the district of columbia such dream can never be realize by any agency of mine the people of the district of columbia be not the subject of the people of the states but free american citizen be in the latter condition when the constitution be form no word use in that instrument could have be intend to deprive they of that character if there be anything in the great principle of unalienable right so emphatically insist upon in our declaration of independence they could neither make nor the united states accept a surrender of their liberty and become the subjects&mdash;in other word the slaves&mdash;of their former fellow citizen if this be true&mdash;and it will scarcely be deny by anyone who have a correct idea of his own right as an american citizen&mdash;the grant to congress of exclusive jurisdiction in the district of columbia can be interpret so far as respect the aggregate people of the united states as mean nothing more than to allow to congress the control power necessary to afford a free and safe exercise of the function assign to the general government by the constitution in all other respect the legislation of congress should be adapt to their peculiar position and want and be conformable with their deliberate opinion of their own interest

 i have speak of the necessity of keep the respective department of the government as well as all the other authority of our country within their appropriate orbit this be a matter of difficulty in some case as the power which they respectively claim be often not define by any distinct line mischievous however in their tendency as collision of this kind may be those which arise between the respective community which for certain purpose compose one nation be much more so for no such nation can long exist without the careful culture of those feeling of confidence and affection which be the effective bond to union between free and confederate state strong as be the tie of interest it have be often find ineffectual man blind by their passion have be know to adopt measure for their country in direct opposition to all the suggestion of policy the alternative then be to destroy or keep down a bad passion by create and foster a good one and this seem to be the corner stone upon which our american political architect have rear the fabric of our government the cement which be to bind it and perpetuate its existence be the affectionate attachment between all its member to insure the continuance of this feeling produce at first by a community of danger of suffering and of interest the advantage of each be make accessible to all no participation in any good possess by any member of our extensive confederacy except in domestic government be withhold from the citizen of any other member by aprocess attend with no difficulty no delay no expense but that of removal the citizen of one might become the citizen of any other and successively of the whole the line too separate power to be exercise by the citizen of one state from those of another seem to be so distinctly draw as to leave no room for misunderstanding the citizen of each state unite in their person all the privilege which that character confer and all that they may claim as citizen of the united states but in no case can the same person at the same time act as the citizen of two separate states and he be therefore positively preclude from any interference with the reserved power of any state but that of which he be for the time be a citizen he may indeed offer to the citizen of other states his advice as to their management and the form in which it be tender be leave to his own discretion and sense of propriety it may be observe however that organized association of citizen require compliance with their wish too much resemble the recommendation of athens to her ally support by an armed and powerful fleet it be indeed to the ambition of the lead states of greece to control the domestic concern of the other that the destruction of that celebrate confederacy and subsequently of all its member be mainly to be attribute and it be owe to the absence of that spirit that the helvetic confederacy have for so many year be preserve never have there be see in the institution of the separate member of any confederacy more element of discord in the principle and form of government and religion as well as in the circumstance of the several canton so mark a discrepancy be observable as to promise anything but harmony in their intercourse or permanency in their alliance and yet for age neither have be interrupt content with the positive benefit which their union produce with the independence and safety from foreign aggression which it secure these sagacious people respect the institution of each other however repugnant to their own principle and prejudice

 our confederacy fellow citizen can only be preserve by the same forbearance our citizen must be content with the exercise of the power with which the constitution clothe they the attempt of those of one state to control the domestic institution of another can only result in feeling of distrust and jealousy the certain harbinger of disunion violence and civil war and the ultimate destruction of our free institution our confederacy be perfectly illustrate by the term and principle govern a common copartnership there be a fund of power to be exercise under the direction of the joint council of the allied member but that which have be reserve by the individual member be intangible by the common government or the individual member compose it to attempt it find no support in the principle of our constitution

 it should be our constant and earnest endeavor mutually to cultivate a spirit of concord and harmony among the various part of our confederacy experience have abundantly teach we that the agitation by citizen of one part of the union of a subject not confide to the general government but exclusively under the guardianship of the local authority be productive of no other consequence than bitterness alienation discord and injury to the very cause which be intend to be advance of all the great interest which appertain to our country that of union cordial confiding fraternal union&mdash;is by far the most important since it be the only true and sure
 guaranty of all other

 in consequence of the embarrassed state of business and the currency some of the states may meet with difficulty in their financial concern however deeply we may regret anything imprudent or excessive in the engagement into which states have enter for purpose of their own it do not become we to disparage the states government nor to discourage they from make proper effort for their own relief on the contrary it be our duty to encourage they to the extent of our constitutional authority to apply their good mean and cheerfully to make all necessary sacrifice and submit to all necessary burden to fulfill their engagement and maintain their credit for the character and credit of the several states form a part of the character and credit of the whole country the resource of the country be abundant the enterprise and activity of our people proverbial and we may well hope that wise legislation and prudent administration by the respective government each act within its own sphere will restore former prosperity

 unpleasant and even dangerous as collision may sometimes be between the constituted authority of the citizen of our country in relation to the line which separate their respective jurisdiction the result can be of no vital injury to our institution if that ardent patriotism that devoted attachment to liberty that spirit of moderation and forbearance for which our countryman be once distinguish continue to be cherish if this continue to be the rule passion of our soul the weak feeling of the mistaken enthusiast will be correct the utopian dream of the scheme politician dissipate and the complicated intrigue of the demagogue render harmless the spirit of liberty be the sovereign balm for every injury which our institution may receive on the contrary no care that can be use in the construction of our government no division of power no distribution of check in its several department will prove effectual to keep we a free people if this spirit be suffer to decay and decay it will without constant nurture to the neglect of this duty the good historian agree in attribute the ruin of all the republic with whose existence and fall their writing have make we acquaint the same cause will ever produce the same effect and as long as the love of power be a dominant passion of the human bosom and as long as the understanding of man can be warp and their affection change by operation upon their passion and prejudice so long will the liberty of a people depend on their own constant attention to its preservation the danger to all well establish free government arise from the unwillingness of the people to believe in its existence or from the influence of design man divert their attention from the quarter whence it approach to a source from which it can never come this be the old trick of those who would usurp the government of their country in the name of democracy they speak warn the people against the influence of wealth and the danger of aristocracy history ancient and modern be full of such example caesar become the master of the roman people and the senate under the pretense of support the democratic claim of the former against the aristocracy of the latter cromwell in the character of protector of the liberty of the people become the dictator of england and bolivar possess himself of unlimited power with the title of his country&#39; liberator there be on the contrary no instance on record of an extensive and well- establish republic be change into an aristocracy the tendency of all such government in their decline be to monarchy and the antagonist principle to liberty there be the spirit of faction&mdash;a spirit which assume the character and in time of great excitement impose itself upon the people as the genuine spirit of freedom and like the false christs whose come be foretell by the savior seek to and be it possible would impose upon the true and most faithful disciple of liberty it be in period like this that it behoove the people to be most watchful of those to whom they have intrust power and although there be at time much difficulty in distinguish the false from the true spirit a calm and dispassionate investigation will detect the counterfeit as well by the character of its operation as the result that be produce the true spirit of liberty although devoted persevere bold and uncompromise in principle that secure be mild and tolerant and scrupulous as to the mean it employ whilst the spirit of party assume to be that of liberty be harsh vindictive and intolerant and totally reckless as to the character of the ally which it bring to the aid of its cause when the genuine spirit of liberty animate the body of a people to a thorough examination of their affair it lead to the excision of every excrescence which may have fasten itself upon any of the department of the government and restore the system to its pristine health and beauty but the reign of an intolerant spirit of party amongst a free people seldom fail to result in a dangerous accession to the executive power introduce and establish amidst unusual profession of devotion to democracy

 the foregoing remark relate almost exclusively to matter connect with our domestic concern it may be proper however that i should give some indication to my fellow citizen of my propose course of conduct in the management of our foreign relation i assure they therefore that it be my intention to use every mean in my power to preserve the friendly intercourse which now so happily subsist with every foreign nation and that although of course not well inform as to the state of pende negotiation with any of they i see in the personal character of the sovereign as well as in the mutual interest of our own and of the government with which our relation be most intimate a pleasing guaranty that the harmony so important to the interest of their subject as well as of our citizen will not be interrupt by the advancement of any claim or pretension upon their part to which our honor would not permit we to yield long the defender of my country&#39; right in the field i trust that my fellow citizen will not see in my earnest desire to preserve peace with foreign power any indication that their right will ever be sacrifice or the honor of the nation tarnish by any admission on the part of their chief magistrate unworthy of their former glory in our intercourse with our aboriginal neighbor the same liberality and justice which mark the course prescribe to i by two of my illustrious predecessor when act under their direction in the discharge of the duty of superintendent and commissioner shall be strictly observe i can conceive of no more sublime spectacle none more likely to propitiate an impartial and common creator than a rigid adherence to the principle of justice on the part of a powerful nation in its transaction with aweaker and uncivilized people whom circumstance have place at its disposal

 before conclude fellow citizen i must say something to you on the subject of the party at this time exist in our country to i it appear perfectly clear that the interest of that country require that the violence of the spirit by which those party be at this time govern must be greatly mitigate if not entirely extinguish or consequence will ensue which be appal to be think of

 if party in a republic be necessary to secure a degree of vigilance sufficient to keep the public functionary within the bound of law and duty at that point their usefulness end beyond that they become destructive of public virtue the parent of a spirit antagonist to that of liberty and eventually its inevitable conqueror we have example of republic where the love of country and of liberty at one time be the dominant passion of the whole mass of citizen and yet with the continuance of the name and form of free government not a vestige of these quality remain in the bosom of any one of its citizen it be the beautiful remark of a distinguished english writer that in the roman senate octavius have a party and anthony a party but the commonwealth have none yet the senate continue to meet in the temple of liberty to talk of the sacredness and beauty of the commonwealth and gaze at the statue of the eld brutus and of the curtii and decii and the people assemble in the forum not as in the day of camillus and the scipios to cast their free vote for annual magistrate or pass upon the act of the senate but to receive from the hand of the leader of the respective party their share of the spoil and to shout for one or the other as those collect in gaul or egypt and the less asia would furnish the large dividend the spirit of liberty have flee and avoid the abode of civilized man have seek protection in the wild of scythia or scandinavia and so under the operation of the same cause and influence it will fly from our capitol and our forum a calamity so awful not only to our country but to the world must be deprecate by every patriot and every tendency to a state of thing likely to produce it immediately check such a tendency have existed&mdash;doe exist always the friend of my countryman never their flatterer it become my duty to say to they from this high place to which their partiality have exalt i that there exist in the land a spirit hostile to their good interests&mdash;hostile to liberty itself it be a spirit contract in its view selfish in its object it look to the aggrandizement of a few even to the destruction of the interest of the whole the entire remedy be with the people something however may be effect by the mean which they have place in my hand it be union that we want not of a party for the sake of that party but aunion of the whole country for the sake of the whole country for the defense of its interest and its honor against foreign aggression for the defense of those principle for which our ancestor so gloriously contend as far as it depend upon i it shall be accomplish all the influence that i possess shall be exert to prevent the formation at least of an executive party in the hall of the legislative body i wish for the support of no member of that body to any measure of mine that do not satisfy his judgment and his sense of duty to those from whom he hold his appointment nor any confidence in advance from the people but that ask for by mr. jefferson to give firmness and effect to the legal administration of their affair

 i deem the present occasion sufficiently important and solemn to justify i in express to my fellow citizen a profound reverence for the christian religion and a thorough conviction that sound moral religious liberty and a just sense of religious responsibility be essentially connect with all true and last happiness and to that good being who have bless we by the gift of civil and religious freedom who watch over and prosper the labor of our father and have hitherto preserve to we institution far exceed in excellence those of any other people let we unite in fervently commend every interest of our beloved country in all future time

 fellow citizen be fully invest with that high office to which the partiality of my countryman have call i i now take an affectionate leave of you you will bear with you to your home the remembrance of the pledge i have this day give to discharge all the high duty of my exalt station accord to the good of my ability and i shall enter upon their performance with entire confidence in the support of a just and generous people
to the people of the united states
 fellow citizens before my arrival at the seat of government the painful communication be make to you by the officer preside over the several departments of the deeply regret death of william henry harrison late president of the united states upon he you have confer your suffrage for the first office in your gift and have select he as your choose instrument to correct and reform all such error and abuse as have manifest themselves from time to time in the practical operation of the government while stand at the threshold of this great work he have by the dispensation of an all wise providence be remove from amongst we and by the provision of the constitution the effort to be direct to the accomplishing of this vitally important task have devolve upon myself this same occurrence have subject the wisdom and sufficiency of our institution to a new test for the first time in our history the person elect to the vice presidency of the united states by the happening of a contingency provide for in the constitution have have devolve upon he the presidential office the spirit of faction which be directly oppose to the spirit of a lofty patriotism may find in this occasion for assault upon my administration and in succeed under circumstance so sudden and unexpected and to responsibility so greatly augmented to the administration of public affair i shall place in the intelligence and patriotism of the people my only sure reliance my earnest prayer shall be constantly address to the all wise and all powerful being who make i and by whose dispensation i be call to the high office of president of this confederacy understandingly to carry out the principle of that constitution which i have swear to protect preserve and defend
 the usual opportunity which be afford to a chief magistrate upon his induction to office of present to his countryman an exposition of the policy which would guide his administration in the form of an inaugural address not have under the peculiar circumstance which have bring i to the discharge of the high duty of president of the united states be afford to i a brief exposition of the principle which will govern i in the general course of my administration of public affair would seem to be due as well to myself as to you
 in regard to foreign nation the groundwork of my policy will be justice on our part to all submit to injustice from none while i shall sedulously cultivate the relation of peace and amity with one and all it will be my most imperative duty to see that the honor of the country shall sustain no blemish with a view to this the condition of our military defense will become a matter of anxious solicitude the army which have in other day cover itself with renown and the navy not inappropriately term the right arm of the public defense which have spread a light of glory over the american standard in all the water of the earth should be render replete with efficiency
 in view of the fact well avouch by history that the tendency of all human institution be to concentrate power in the hand of a single man and that their ultimate downfall have proceed from this cause i deem it of the most essential importance that a complete separation should take place between the sword and the purse no matter where or how the public money shall be deposit so long as the president can exert the power of appoint and remove at his pleasure the agent select for their custody the commander in chief of the army and navy be in fact the treasurer a permanent and radical change should therefore be decreed the patronage incident to the presidential office already great be constantly increase such increase be destine to keep pace with the growth of our population until without a figure of speech an army of officeholder may be spread over the land the unrestrained power exert by a selfishly ambitious man in order either to perpetuate his authority or to hand it over to some favorite as his successor may lead to the employment of all the mean within his control to accomplish his object the right to remove from office while subject to no just restraint be inevitably destine to produce a spirit of crouch servility with the official corps which in order to uphold the hand which feed they would lead to direct and active interference in the election both state and federal thereby subject the course of state legislation to the dictation of the chief executive officer and make the will of that officer absolute and supreme i will at a proper time invoke the action of congress upon this subject and shall readily acquiesce in the adoption of all proper measure which be calculate to arrest these evil so full of danger in their tendency i will remove no incumbent from office who have faithfully and honestly acquit himself of the duty of his office except in such case where such officer have be guilty of an active partisanship or by secret mean the less manly and therefore the more objectionable have give his official influence to the purpose of party thereby bring the patronage of the government in conflict with the freedom of election numerous removal may become necessary under this rule these will be make by i through no acerbity of feeling i have have no cause to cherish or indulge unkind feeling toward any but my conduct will be regulate by a profound sense of what be due to the country and its institution nor shall i neglect to apply the same unbending rule to those of my own appointment freedom of opinion will be tolerate the full enjoyment of the right of suffrage will be maintain as the birthright of every american citizen but i say emphatically to the official corps thus far and no far i have dwell the long upon this subject because removal from office be likely often to arise and i would have my countryman to understand the principle of the executive action
 in all public expenditure the most rigid economy should be resort to and as one of its result a public debt in time of peace be sedulously avoid a wise and patriotic constituency will never object to the imposition of necessary burden for useful end and true wisdom dictate the resort to such mean in order to supply deficiency in the revenue rather than to those doubtful expedient which ultimate in a public debt serve to embarrass the resource of the country and to lessen its ability to meet any great emergency which may arise all sinecure should be abolish the appropriation should be direct and explicit so as to leave as limit a share of discretion to the disburse agent as may be find compatible with the public service a strict responsibility on the part of all the agent of the government should be maintain and peculation or defalcation visit with immediate expulsion from office and the most condign punishment
 the public interest also demand that if any war have exist between the government and the currency it shall cease measure of a financial character now have the sanction of legal enactment shall be faithfully enforce until repeal by the legislative authority but i owe it to myself to declare that i regard exist enactment as unwise and impolitic and in a high degree oppressive i shall promptly give my sanction to any constitutional measure which originate in congress shall have for its object the restoration of a sound circulate medium so essentially necessary to give confidence in all the transaction of life to secure to industry its just and adequate reward and to reestablish the public prosperity in decide upon the adaptation of any such measure to the end propose as well as its conformity to the constitution i shall resort to the father of the great republican school for advice and instruction to be draw from their sage view of our system of government and the light of their ever glorious example
 the institution under which we live my countryman secure each person in the perfect enjoyment of all his right the spectacle be exhibit to the world of a government derive its power from the consent of the governed and having impart to it only so much power as be necessary for its successful operation those who be charge with its administration should carefully abstain from all attempt to enlarge the range of power thus grant to the several department of the government other than by an appeal to the people for additional grant lest by so do they disturb that balance which the patriot and statesman who frame the constitution design to establish between the federal government and the states compose the union the observance of these rule be enjoin upon we by that feeling of reverence and affection which find a place in the heart of every patriot for the preservation of union and the blessing of union for the good of our child and our children&#39;s child through countless generation an opposite course could not fail to generate faction intent upon the gratification of their selfish end to give birth to local and sectional jealousy and to ultimate either in break asunder the bond of union or in build up a central system which would inevitably end in a bloody scepter and an iron crown
 in conclusion i beg you to be assure that i shall exert myself to carry the foregoing principle into practice during my administration of the government and confide in the protect care of an everwatchful and overruling providence it shall be my first and high duty to preserve unimpaire the free institution under which we live and transmit they to those who shall succeed i in their full force and vigor

 the census recently take show a regularly progressive increase in our population upon the breaking out of the war of the revolution our number scarcely equal 3,000,000 soul they already exceed 17,000,000 and will continue to progress in a ratio which duplicate in a period of about twenty three year the old states contain a territory sufficient in itself to maintain a population of additional million and the most populous of the new states may even yet be regard as but partially settle while of the new land on this side of the rocky mountains to say nothing of the immense region which stretch from the base of those mountain to the mouth of the columbia river about 770,000,000 acre cede and unceded still remain to be bring into market we hold out to the people of other country an invitation to come and settle among we as member of our rapidly grow family and for the blessing which we offer they we require of they to look upon our country as their country and to unite with we in the great task of preserve our institution and thereby perpetuate our liberty no motive exist for foreign conquest we desire but to reclaim our almost illimitable wilderness and to introduce into their depth the light of civilization while we shall at all time be prepared to vindicate the national honor our most earnest desire will be to maintain an unbroken peace
 in present the forego view i can not withhold the expression of the opinion that there exist nothing in the extension of our empire over our acknowledge possession to excite the alarm of the patriot for the safety of our institution the federative system leave to each state the care of its domestic concern and devolving on the federal government those of general import admit in safety of the great expansion but at the same time i deem it proper to add that there will be find to exist at all time an imperious necessity for restrain all the functionary of this government within the range of their respective power thereby preserve a just balance between the power grant to this government and those reserve to the states and to the people
 from the report of the secretary of the treasury you will perceive that the fiscal mean present and accruing be insufficient to supply the want of the government for the current year the balance in the treasury on the 4th day of march last not cover by outstanding draft and exclusive of trust fund be estimate at $ 860,000 this include the sum of $ 215,000 deposit in the mint and its branch to procure metal for coin and in process of coinage and which could not be withdraw without inconvenience thus leave subject to draft in the various depository the sum of $ 645,000 by virtue of two several act of congress the secretary of the treasury be authorize to issue on and after the 4th day of march last treasury note to the amount of $ 5,413,000 make an aggregate available fund of $ 6,058,000 on hand
 but this fund be chargeable with outstanding treasury note redeemable in the current year and interest thereon to the estimate amount of $ 5,280,000 there be also throw upon the treasury the payment of a large amount of demand accrue in whole or in part in former year which will exhaust the available mean of the treasury and leave the accruing revenue reduce as it be in amount burthen with debt and charge with the current expense of the government
 the aggregate amount of outstanding appropriation on the 4th day of march last be $ 33,429,616.50 of which $ 24,210,000 will be require during the current year and there will also be require for the use of the war department additional appropriation to the amount of $ 2,511,132.98 the special object of which will be see by reference to the report of the secretary of war the anticipated mean of the treasury be greatly inadequate to this demand the receipt from custom for the last three quarter of the last year and first quarter of the present year amount to $ 12,100,000 the receipt for land for the same time to $ 2,742,450 shew an average revenue from both source of $ 1,236,870 per month
 a gradual expansion of trade grow out of a restoration of confidence together with a reduction in the expense of collect and punctuality on the part of collect officer may cause an addition to the monthly receipt from the custom they be estimate for the residue of the year from the 4th of march at $ 12,000,000 the receipt from the public land for the same time be estimate at $ 2,500,000 and from miscellaneous source at $ 12,000,000 make an aggregate of available fund within the year of $ 15,315,000 which will leave a probable deficit of $ 11,406,132.98 to meet this some temporary provision be necessary until the amount can be absorb by the excess of revenue which be anticipate to accrue at no distant day
 there will fall due within the next three month treasury note of the issue of 1840 include interest about $ 2,850,000 there be chargeable in the same period for arrearage for take the sixth census $ 294,000 and the estimate expenditure for the current service be about $ 8,100,000 make the aggregate demand upon the treasury prior to the 1st of september next about $ 11,340,000
 the way and mean in the treasury and estimate to accrue within the above name period consist of about $ 694,000 of fund available on the 28th ultimo an unissued balance of treasury note authorize by the act of 1841 amount to $ 1,955,000 and estimate receipt from all source of $ 3,800,000 make an aggregate of about $ 6,450,000 and leave a probable deficit on the 1st of september next of $ 4,845,000
 in order to supply the want of the government an intelligent constituency in view of their good interest will without hesitation submit to all necessary burthen but it be nevertheless important so to impose they as to avoid defeat the just expectation of the country grow out of preexist law the act of the 2d of march 1833 commonly call the compromise act should not be alter except under urgent necessity which be not believe at this time to exist one year only remain to complete the series of reduction provide for by that law at which time provision make by the same law and which then will be bring actively in aid of the manufacture interest of the union will not fail to produce the most beneficial result under a system of discriminating duty impose for purpose of revenue in unison with the provision of exist law it be to be hope that our policy will in the future be fix and permanent so as to avoid those constant fluctuation which defeat the very object they have in view we shall thus well maintain a position which while it will enable we the more readily to meet the advance of other country calculate to promote our trade and commerce will at the same time leave in our own hand the mean of retaliate with great effect unjust regulation
 in intimate connection with the question of revenue be that which make provision for a suitable fiscal agent capable of add increase facility in the collection and disbursement of the public revenue render more secure their custody and consult a true economy in the great multiplied and delicate operation of the treasury department upon such an agent depend in an eminent degree the establishment of a currency of uniform value which be of so great importance to all the essential interest of society and on the wisdom to be manifest in its creation much depend so intimately interwoven be its operation not only with the interest of individual but of states that it may be regard to a great degree as control both if paper be use as the chief medium of circulation and the power be vest in the government of issue it at pleasure either in the form of treasury draft or any other or if bank be use as the public depository with liberty to regard all surplus from day to day as so much add to their active capital price be expose to constant fluctuation and industry to severe suffering in the one case political consideration direct to party purpose may control while excessive cupidity may prevail in the other the public be thus constantly liable to imposition expansion and contraction may follow each other in rapid succession the one engender a reckless spirit of adventure and speculation which embrace states as well as individual the other cause a fall in price and accomplish an entire change in the aspect of affair stock of all sort rapidly decline individual be ruin and states embarrass even in their effort to meet with punctuality the interest on their debt such unhappily be the condition of thing now exist in the united states these effect may readily be trace to the cause above refer to the public revenue be remove from the then bank of the united states under an order of a late president be place in select state bank which actuate by the double motive of conciliate the government and augment their profit to the great possible extent enlarge extravagantly their discount thus enable all other exist bank to do the same large dividend be declare which stimulate the cupidity of capitalist cause a rush to be make to the legislature of the respective states for similar act of incorporation which by many of the states under a temporary infatuation be readily grant and thus the augmentation of the circulate medium consist almost exclusively of paper produce a most fatal delusion an illustration derive from the land sale of the period allude to will serve well to show the effect of the whole system the average sale of the public land for a period of ten year prior to 1834 have not much exceed $ 2,000,000 per annum in 1834 they attain in round number to the amount of $ 6,000,000 in the succeed year of 1835 they reach $ 16,000,000 and the next year of 1836 they amount to the enormous sum of $ 25,000,000 thus crowd into the short space of three year upward of twenty three years&#39 purchase of the public domain so apparent have become the necessity of arrest this course of thing that the executive department assume the highly questionable power of discriminate in the fund to be use in payment by different class of public debtor a discrimination which be doubtless design to correct this most ruinous state of thing by the exaction of specie in all payment for the public land but which could not at once arrest the tide which have so strongly set in hence the demand for specie become unceasing and correspond prostration rapidly ensue under the necessity create with the bank to curtail their discount and thereby to reduce their circulation i recur to these thing with no disposition to censure preexist administration of the government but simply in exemplification of the truth of the position which i have assume if then any fiscal agent which may be create shall be place without due restriction either in the hand of the administrator of the government or those of private individual the temptation to abuse will prove to be resistless object of political aggrandizement may seduce the first and the prompting of a boundless cupidity will assail the last aid by the experience of the past it will be the pleasure of congress so to guard and fortify the public interest in the creation of any new agent as to place they so far as human wisdom can accomplish it on a footing of perfect security within a few year past three different scheme have be before the country the charter of the bank of the united states expire by its own limitation in 1836 an effort be make to renew it which receive the sanction of the two houses of congress but the then president of the united states exercise his veto power and the measure be defeat a regard to truth require i to say that the president be fully sustain in the course he have take by the popular voice his successor to the chair of state unqualifiedly pronounce his opposition to any new charter of a similar institution and not only the popular election which bring he into power but the election through much of his term seem clearly to indicate a concurrence with he in sentiment on the part of the people after the public money be withdraw from the united states bank they be place in deposit with the state bank and the result of that policy have be before the country to say nothing as to the question whether that experiment be make under propitious or adverse circumstance it may safely be assert that it do receive the unqualified condemnation of most of its early advocate and it be believe be also condemn by the popular sentiment the exist subtreasury system do not seem to stand in high favor with the people but have recently be condemn in a manner too plainly indicate to admit of a doubt thus in the short period of eight year the popular voice may be regard as having successively condemn each of the three scheme of finance to which i have advert as to the first it be introduce at a time 1816 when the state bank then comparatively few in number have be force to suspend specie payment by reason of the war which have previously prevail with great britain whether if the united states bank charter which expire in 1811 have be renew in due season it would have be enable to continue specie payment during the war and the disastrous period to the commerce of the country which immediately succeed be to say the least problematical and whether the united states bank of 1816 produce a restoration of specie payment or the same be accomplish through the instrumentality of other mean be a matter of some difficulty at that time to determine certain it be that for the first year of the operation of that bank its course be as disastrous as for the great part of its subsequent career it become eminently successful as to the second the experiment be try with a redundant treasury which continue to increase until it seem to be the part of wisdom to distribute the surplus revenue among the states which operate at the same time with the specie circular and the cause before advert to cause they to suspend specie payment and involve the country in the great embarrassment and as to the third if carry through all the stage of its transmutation from paper and specie to nothing but the precious metal to say nothing of the insecurity of the public money its injurious effect have be anticipate by the country in its unqualified condemnation what be now to be regard as the judgment of the american people on this whole subject i have no accurate mean of determine but by appeal to their more immediate representative the late contest which terminate in the election of general harrison to the presidency be decide on principle well know and openly declare and while the subtreasury receive in the result the most decided condemnation yet no other scheme of finance seem to have be concur in to you then who have come more directly from the body of our common constituent i submit the entire question as well qualified to give a full exposition of their wish and opinion i shall be ready to concur with you in the adoption of such system as you may propose reserve to myself the ultimate power of reject any measure which may in my view of it conflict with the constitution or otherwise jeopardize the prosperity of the country a power which i could not part with even if i would but which i will not believe any act of yours will call into requisition
 i can not avoid recur in connection with this subject to the necessity which exist for adopt some suitable measure whereby the unlimited creation of bank by the states may be correct in future such result can be most readily achieve by the consent of the states to be express in the form of a compact among themselves which they can only enter into with the consent and approbation of this government a consent which might in the present emergency of the public demand justifiably be give by congress in advance of any action by the states as an inducement to such action upon term well define by the act of tender such a measure address itself to the calm reflection of the states would find in the experience of the past and the condition of the present much to sustain it and it be greatly to be doubt whether any scheme of finance can prove for any length of time successful while the states shall continue in the unrestrained exercise of the power of create banking corporation this power can only be limit by their consent
 with the adoption of a financial agency of a satisfactory character the hope may be indulge that the country may once more return to a state of prosperity measure auxiliary thereto and in some measure inseparably connect with its success will doubtless claim the attention of congress among such a distribution of the proceed of the sale of the public land provide such distribution do not force upon congress the necessity of impose upon commerce heavy burthen than those contemplate by the act of 1833 would act as an efficient remedial measure by be bring directly in aid of the states as one sincerely devoted to the task of preserve a just balance in our system of government by the maintenance of the states in a condition the most free and respectable and in the full possession of all their power i can no otherwise than feel desirous for their emancipation from the situation to which the pressure on their finance now subject they and while i must repudiate as a measure found in error and want constitutional sanction the slight approach to an assumption by this government of the debt of the states yet i can see in the distribution advert too much to recommend it the compact between the proprietor states and this government expressly guarantee to the states all the benefit which may arise from the sale the mode by which this be to be effect address itself to the discretion of congress as the trustee for the states and its exercise after the most beneficial manner be restrain by nothing in the grant or in the constitution so long as congress shall consult that equality in the distribution which the compact require in the present condition of some of the states the question of distribution may be regard as substantially a question between direct and indirect taxation if the distribution be not make in some form or other the necessity will daily become more urgent with the debtor states for a resort to an oppressive system of direct taxation or their credit and necessarily their power and influence will be greatly diminish the payment of taxis after the most inconvenient and oppressive mode will be exact in place of contribution for the most part voluntarily make and therefore comparatively unoppressive the states be emphatically the constituent of this government and we should be entirely regardless of the object hold in view by they in the creation of this government if we could be indifferent to their good the happy effect of such a measure upon all the states would immediately be manifest with the debtor states it would effect the relief to a great extent of the citizen from a heavy burthen of direct taxation which press with severity on the labor class and eminently assist in restore the general prosperity an immediate advance would take place in the price of the state security and the attitude of the states would become once more as it should ever be lofty and erect with state labor under no extreme pressure from debt the fund which they would derive from this source would enable they to improve their condition in an eminent degree so far as this government be concern appropriation to domestic object approach in amount the revenue derive from the land sale might be abandon and thus a system of unequal and therefore unjust legislation would be substitute by one dispense equality to all the member of this confederacy whether such distribution should be make directly to the states in the proceed of the sale or in the form of profit by virtue of the operation of any fiscal agency have those proceed as its basis should such measure be contemplate by congress would well deserve its consideration nor would such disposition of the proceed of the sale in any manner prevent congress from time to time from pass all necessary preemption law for the benefit of actual settler or from make any new arrangement as to the price of the public land which might in future be esteem desirable
 i beg leave particularly to call your attention to the accompany report from the secretary of war besides the present state of the war which have so long afflict the territory of florida and the various other matter of interest therein refer to you will learn from it that the secretary have institute an inquiry into abuse which promise to develop gross enormity in connection with indian treaty which have be negotiate as well as in the expenditure for the removal and subsistence of the indians he represent also other irregularity of a serious nature that have grow up in the practice of the indian department which will require the appropriation of upward of $ 200,000 to correct and which claim the immediate attention of congress
 in reflect on the proper mean of defend the country we can not shut our eye to the consequence which the introduction and use of the power of steam upon the ocean be likely to produce in war between maritime state we can not yet see the extent to which this power may be apply in belligerent operation connect itself as it do with recent improvement in the science of gunnery and projectile but we need have no fear of be leave in regard to these thing behind the most active and skillful of other nation if the genius and enterprise of our fellow citizen receive proper encouragement and direction from government
 true wisdom would nevertheless seem to dictate the necessity of place in perfect condition those fortification which be design for the protection of our principal city and roadstead for the defense of our extend maritime coast our chief reliance should be place on our navy aid by those invention which be destine to recommend themselves to public adoption but no time should be lose in place our principal city on the seaboard and the lakes in a state of entire security from foreign assault separate as we be from the country of the old world and in much unaffected by their policy we be happily relieve from the necessity of maintain large stand army in time of peace the policy which be adopt by mr. monroe shortly after the conclusion of the late war with great britain of preserve a regularly organize staff sufficient for the command of a large military force should a necessity for one arise be round as well in economy as in true wisdom provision be thus make upon fill up the rank and file which can readily be do on any emergency for the introduction of a system of discipline both promptly and efficiently all that be require in time of peace be to maintain a sufficient number of man to guard our fortification to meet any sudden contingency and to encounter the first shock of war our chief reliance must be place on the militia they constitute the great body of national guard and inspire by an ardent love of country will be find ready at all time and at all season to repair with alacrity to its defense it will be regard by congress i doubt not at a suitable time as one of its high duty to attend to their complete organization and discipline
 the state of the navy pension fund require the immediate attention of congress by the operation of the act of the 3d of march 1837 entitle an act for the more equitable administration of the navy pension fund that fund have be exhaust it will be see from the accompany report of the commissioner of pensions that there will be require for the payment of navy pension on the 1st of july next $ 88,706.06 1/3 and on the 1st of january 1842 the sum of $ 69,000 in addition to these sum about $ 6,000 will be require to pay arrear of pension which will probably be allow between the 1st of july and the 1st of january 1842 make in the whole $ 163,706.06 1/3 to meet these payment there be within the control of the department the sum of $ 28,040 leave a deficiency of $ 139,666.06 1/3 the public faith require that immediate provision should be make for the payment of these sum
 in order to introduce into the navy a desirable efficiency a new system of accountability may be find to be indispensably necessary to mature a plan have for its object the accomplishment of an end so important and to meet the just expectation of the country require more time than have yet be allow to the secretary at the head of the department the hope be indulge that by the time of your next regular session measure of importance in connection with this branch of the public service may be mature for your consideration
 although the law regulate the post office department only require from the officer charge with its direction to report at the usual annual session of congress the postmaster general have present to i some fact connect with the financial condition of the department which be deem worthy the attention of congress by the accompany report of that officer it appear the exist liability of that department beyond the mean of payment at its command can not be less than $ 500,000 as the law organize that branch of the public service confine the expenditure to its own revenue deficiency therein can not be present under the usual estimate for the expense of government it must therefore be leave to congress to determine whether the money now due the contractor shall be pay from the public treasury or whether that department shall continue under its present embarrassment it will be see by the report of the postmaster general that the recent letting of contract in several of the states have be make at such reduce rate of compensation as to encourage the belief that if the department be relieve from exist difficulty its future operation might be conduct without any further call upon the general treasury
 the power of appoint to office be one of a character the most delicate and responsible the appoint power be evermore expose to be lead into error with anxious solicitude to select the most trustworthy for official station i can not be suppose to possess a personal knowledge of the qualification of every applicant i deem it therefore proper in this most public manner to invite on the part of the senate a just scrutiny into the character and pretension of every person i may bring to their notice in the regular form of a nomination for office unless person every way trustworthy be employ in the public service corruption and irregularity will inevitably follow i shall with the great cheerfulness acquiesce in the decision of that body and regard it as wisely constitute to aid the executive department in the performance of this delicate duty i shall look to its consent and advice as give only in furtherance of the good interest of the country i shall also at the early proper occasion invite the attention of congress to such measure as in my judgment will be well calculate to regulate and control the executive power in reference to this vitally important subject
 i shall also at the proper season invite your attention to the statutory enactment for the suppression of the slave trade which may require to be render more efficient in their provision there be reason to believe that the traffic be on the increase whether such increase be to be ascribe to the abolition of slave labor in the british possession in our vicinity and an attendant diminution in the supply of those article which enter into the general consumption of the world thereby augment the demand from other quarter and thus call for additional labor it be needless to inquire the high consideration of public honor as well as the strong prompting of humanity require a resort to the most vigorous effort to suppress the trade
 in conclusion i beg to invite your particular attention to the interest of this district nor do i doubt but that in a liberal spirit of legislation you will seek to advance its commercial as well as its local interest should congress deem it to be its duty to repeal the exist subtreasury law the necessity of provide a suitable place of deposit of the public money which may be require within the district must be apparent to all
 i have feel it due to the country to present the forego topic to your consideration and reflection other with which it might not seem proper to trouble you at an extraordinary session will be lay before you at a future day i be happy in commit the important affair of the country into your hand the tendency of public sentiment i be pleased to believe be toward the adoption in a spirit of union and harmony of such measure as will fortify the public interest to cherish such a tendency of public opinion be the task of an elevated patriotism that difference of opinion as to the mean of accomplish these desirable object should exist be reasonably to be expect nor can all be make satisfied with any system of measure but i flatter myself with the hope that the great body of the people will readily unite in support of those whose effort spring from a disinterested desire to promote their happiness to preserve the federal and state government within their respective orbit to cultivate peace with all the nation of the earth on just and honorable ground to exact obedience to the law to intrench liberty and property in full security and consult the most rigid economy to abolish all useless expense

to the senate of the united states
 the bill entitle an act to incorporate the subscriber to the fiscal bank of the united states which originate in the senate have be consider by i with a sincere desire to conform my action in regard to it to that of the two houses of congress by the constitution it be make my duty either to approve the bill by sign it or to return it with my objection to the house in which it originate i can not conscientiously give it my approval and i proceed to discharge the duty require of i by the constitution to give my reason for disapprove
 the power of congress to create a national bank to operate per se over the union have be a question of dispute from the origin of the government man most justly and deservedly esteemed for their high intellectual endowment their virtue and their patriotism have in regard to it entertain different and conflict opinion congresses have differ the approval of one president have be follow by the disapproval of another the people at different time have acquiesce in decision both for and against the country have be and still be deeply agitated by this unsettled question it will suffice for i to say that my own opinion have be uniformly proclaim to be against the exercise of any such power by this government on all suitable occasion during a period of twenty five year the opinion thus entertain have be unreservedly express i declare it in the legislature of my native state in the house of representatives of the united states it have be openly vindicate by i in the senate chamber in the presence and hearing of many who be at this time member of that body it have be affirm and reaffirm in speech and report there make and by vote there record in popular assembly i have unhesitatingly announce it and the last public declaration which i make and that but a short time before the late presidential election i refer to my previously express opinion as be those then entertain by i with a full knowledge of the opinion thus entertain and never conceal i be elect by the people vice president of the united states by the occurrence of a contingency provide for in the constitution and arise under an impressive dispensation of providence i succeed to the presidential office before enter upon the duty of that office i take an oath that i would preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states entertain the opinion allude to and having take this oath the senate and the country will see that i could not give my sanction to a measure of the character describe without surrender all claim to the respect of honorable man all confidence on the part of the people all self respect all regard for moral and religious obligation without an observance of which no government can be prosperous and no people can be happy it would be to commit a crime which i would not willfully commit to gain any earthly reward and which would justly subject i to the ridicule and scorn of all virtuous man
 i deem it entirely unnecessary at this time to enter upon the reason which have bring my mind to the conviction i feel and entertain on this subject they have be over and over again repeat if some of those who have precede i in this high office have entertain and avow different opinion i yield all confidence that their conviction be sincere i claim only to have the same measure mete out to myself without go far into the argument i will say that in look to the power of this government to collect safely keep and disburse the public revenue and incidentally to regulate the commerce and exchange i have not be able to satisfy myself that the establishment by this government of a bank of discount in the ordinary acceptation of that term be a necessary mean or one demand by propriety to execute those power what can the local discount of the bank have to do with the collecting safe keeping and disbursing of the revenue so far as the mere discounting of paper be concern it be quite immaterial to this question whether the discount be obtain at a state bank or a united states bank they be both equally local both begin and both end in a local accommodation what influence have local discount grant by any form of bank in the regulating of the currency and the exchange let the history of the late united states bank aid we in answer this inquiry
 for several year after the establishment of that institution it deal almost exclusively in local discount and during that period the country be for the most part disappoint in the consequence anticipate from its incorporation a uniform currency be not provide exchange be not regulate and little or nothing be add to the general circulation and in 1920 its embarrassment have become so great that the director petition congress to repeal that article of the charter which make its note receivable everywhere in payment of the public due it have up to that period deal to but a very small extent in exchange either foreign or domestic and as late as 1823 its operation in that line amount to a little more than $ 7,000,000 per annum a very rapid augmentation soon after occur and in 1833 its dealing in the exchange amount to upward of $ 100,000,000 include the sale of its own draft and all these immense transaction be effect without the employment of extraordinary mean the currency of the country become sound and the negotiation in the exchange be carry on at the low possible rate the circulation be increase to more than $ 22,000,000 and the note of the bank be regard as equal to specie all over the country thus show almost conclusively that it be the capacity to deal in exchange and not in local discount which furnish these facility and advantage it may be remark too that notwithstanding the immense transaction of the bank in the purchase of exchange the loss sustain be merely nominal while in the line of discount the suspend debt be enormous and prove most disastrous to the bank and the country its power of local discount have in fact prove to be a fruitful source of favoritism and corruption alike destructive to the public moral and to the general weal
 the capital invest in bank of discount in the united states create by the states at this time exceed $ 350,000,000 and if the discounting of local paper could have produce any beneficial effect the united states ought to possess the sound currency in the world but the reverse be lamentably the fact
 be the measure now under consideration of the objectionable character to which i have allude it be clearly so unless by the sixteenth fundamental article of the eleventh section it be make otherwise that article be in the following word
 the director of the say corporation shall establish one competent office of discount and deposit in any state in which two thousand share shall have be subscribe or may be hold whenever upon application of the legislature of such state congress may by law require the same and the say director may also establish one or more competent office of discount and deposit in any territory or district of the united states and in any state with the assent of such state and when establish the say office or office shall be only withdraw or remove by the say director prior to the expiration of this charter with the previous assent of congress provide in respect to any state which shall not at the first session of the legislature thereof hold after the passage of this act by resolution or other usual legislative proceeding unconditionally assent or dissent to the establishment of such office or office within it such assent of the say state shall be thereafter presume and provide nevertheless that whenever it shall become necessary and proper for carry into execution any of the power grant by the constitution to establish an office or office in any of the states whatever and the establishment thereof shall be direct by law it shall be the duty of the say director to establish such office or office accordingly
 it will be see that by this clause the director be invest with the full power to establish a branch in any state which have yield its assent and having once establish such branch it shall not afterwards be withdraw except by order of congress such assent be to be imply and to have the force and sanction of an actually express assent provide in respect to any state which shall not at the first session of the legislature thereof hold after the passage of this act by resolution or other usual legislative proceeding unconditionally assent or dissent to the establishment of such office or office within it such assent of say state shall be thereafter presume the assent or dissent be to be express unconditionally at the first session of the legislature by some formal legislative act and if not so express its assent be to be imply and the director be thereupon invest with power at such time thereafter as they may please to establish branch which can not afterwards be withdraw except by resolve of congress no matter what may be the cause which may operate with the legislature which either prevent it from speak or address itself to its wisdom to induce delay its assent be to be imply this iron rule be to give way to no circumstance it be unbend and inflexible it be the language of the master to the vassal an unconditional answer be claim forthwith and delay postponement or incapacity to answer produce an imply assent which be ever after irrevocable many of the state election have already take place without any knowledge on the part of the people that such a question be to come up the representative may desire a submission of the question to their constituent preparatory to final action upon it but this high privilege be deny whatever may be the motive and view entertain by the representative of the people to induce delay their assent be to be presume and be ever afterwards bind unless their dissent shall be unconditionally express at their first session after the passage of this bill into a law they may by formal resolution declare the question of assent or dissent to be undecided and postpone and yet in opposition to their express declaration to the contrary their assent be to be imply case innumerable might be cite to manifest the irrationality of such an inference let one or two in addition suffice the popular branch of the legislature may express its dissent by an unanimous vote and its resolution may be defeat by a tie vote of the senate and yet the assent be to be imply both branch of the legislature may concur in a resolution of decide dissent and yet the governor may exert the veto power confer on he by the state constitution and their legislative action be defeat and yet the assent of the legislative authority be imply and the director of this contemplated institution be authorize to establish a branch or branch in such state whenever they may find it conducive to the interest of the stockholder to do so and having once establish it they can under no circumstance withdraw it except by act of congress the state may afterwards protest against such unjust inference but its authority be go its assent be imply by its failure or inability to act at its first session and its voice can never afterwards be hear to inference so violent and as they seem to i irrational i can not yield my consent no court of justice would or could sanction they without reverse all that be establish in judicial proceeding by introduce presumption at variance with fact and inference at the expense of reason a state in a condition of duress would be presume to speak as an individual manacle and in prison might be presume to be in the enjoyment of freedom far well to say to the states boldly and frankly congress will and submission be demand
 it may be say that the director may not establish branch under such circumstance but this be a question of power and this bill invest they with full authority to do so if the legislature of new york or pennsylvania or any other state should be find to be in such condition as i have suppose could there be any security furnish against such a step on the part of the director nay be it not fairly to be presume that this proviso be introduce for the sole purpose of meet the contingency refer to why else should it have be introduce and i submit to the senate whether it can be believe that any state would be likely to sit quietly down under such a state of thing in a great measure of public interest their patriotism may be successfully appeal to but to infer their assent from circumstance at war with such inference i can not but regard as calculate to excite a feeling at fatal enmity with the peace and harmony of the country i must therefore regard this clause as assert the power to be in congress to establish office of discount in a state not only without its assent but against its dissent and so regard it i can not sanction it on general principle the right in congress to prescribe term to any state imply a superiority of power and control deprive the transaction of all pretense to compact between they and terminate as we have see in the total abrogation of freedom of action on the part of the states but far the state may express after the most solemn form of legislation its dissent which may from time to time thereafter be repeat in full view of its own interest which can never be separate from the wise and beneficent operation of this government and yet congress may by virtue of the last proviso overrule its law and upon ground which to such state will appear to rest on a constructive necessity and propriety and nothing more i regard the bill as assert for congress the right to incorporate a united states bank with power and right to establish office of discount and deposit in the several states of this union with or without their consent a principle to which i have always heretofore be oppose and which can never obtain my sanction and waive all other consideration grow out of its other provision i return it to the house in which it originate with these my objection to its approval

to the house of representatives of the united states
 it be with extreme regret that i feel myself constrain by the duty faithfully to execute the office of president of the united states and to the good of my ability to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states to return to the house in which it originate the bill to provide for the well collection safe keeping and disbursement of the public revenue by mean of a corporation to be style the fiscal corporation of the united states with my write objection
 in my message send to the senate on the 16th day of august last return the bill to incorporate the subscriber to the fiscal bank of the united states i distinctly declare that my own opinion have be uniformly proclaim to be against the exercise of the power of congress to create a national bank to operate per se over the union and entertain that opinion my main objection to that bill be base upon the high moral and religious obligation of conscience and the constitution i readily admit that whilst the qualified veto with which the chief magistrate be invest should be regard and be intend by the wise man who make it a part of the constitution as a great conservative principle of our system without the exercise of which on important occasion a mere representative majority might urge the government in its legislation beyond the limit fix by its framer or might exert its just power too hastily or oppressively yet it be a power which ought to be most cautiously exert and perhaps never except in a case eminently involve the public interest or one in which the oath of the president act under his conviction both mental and moral imperiously require its exercise in such a case he have no alternative he must either exert the negative power intrust to he by the constitution chiefly for its own preservation protection and defense or commit an act of gross moral turpitude mere regard to the will of a majority must not in a constitutional republic like ours control this sacred and solemn duty of a swear officer the constitution itself i regard and cherish as the embodied and write will of the whole people of the united states it be their fixed and fundamental law which they unanimously prescribe to the public functionary their mere trustee and servant this their will and the law which they have give we as the rule of our action have no guard no guaranty of preservation protection and defense but the oath which it prescribe to the public officer the sanctity with which they shall religiously observe those oath and the patriotism with which the people shall shield it by their own sovereign will which have make the constitution supreme it must be exert against the will of a mere representative majority or not at all it be alone in pursuance of that will that any measure can reach the president and to say that because a majority in congress have pass a bill he should therefore sanction it be to abrogate the power altogether and to render its insertion in the constitution a work of absolute supererogation the duty be to guard the fundamental will of the people themselves from in this case i admit unintentional change or infraction by a majority in congress and in that light alone do i regard the constitutional duty which i now most reluctantly discharge be this bill now present for my approval or disapproval such a bill as i have already declare could not receive my sanction be it such a bill as call for the exercise of the negative power under the constitution do it violate the constitution by create a national bank to operate per se over the union its title in the first place describe its general character it be an act to provide for the well collection safe keeping and disbursement of the public revenue by mean of a corporation to be style the fiscal corporation of the united states in style then it be plainly national in its character its power function and duty be those which pertain to the collecting keeping and disburse the public revenue the mean by which these be to be exert be a corporation to be style the fiscal corporation of the united states it be a corporation create by the congress of the united states in its character of a national legislature for the whole union to perform the fiscal purpose meet the fiscal want and exigency supply the fiscal use and exert the fiscal agency of the treasury of the united states such be its own description of itself do its provision contradict its title they do not it be true that by its first section it provide that it shall be establish in the district of columbia but the amount of its capital the manner in which its stock be to be subscribe for and hold the person and body corporate and politic by whom its stock may be hold the appointment of its director and their power and duty its fundamental article especially that to establish agency in any part of the union the corporate power and business of such agency the prohibition of congress to establish any other corporation with similar power for twenty year with express reservation in the same clause to modify or create any bank for the district of columbia so that the aggregate capital shall not exceed five million without enumerate other feature which be equally distinctive and characteristic clearly show that it can not be regard as other than a bank of the united states with power seemingly more limited than have heretofore be grant to such an institution it operate per se over the union by virtue of the unaided and in my view assume authority of congress as a national legislature as distinguishable from a bank create by congress for the district of columbia as the local legislature of the district every united states bank heretofore create have have power to deal in bill of exchange as well as local discount both be trading privilege confer and both be exercise by virtue of the aforesaid power of congress over the whole union the question of power remain unchanged without reference to the extent of privilege grant if this propose corporation be to be regard as a local bank of the district of columbia invest by congress with general power to operate over the union it be obnoxious to still strong objection it assume that congress may invest a local institution with general or national power with the same propriety that it may do this in regard to a bank of the district of columbia it may as to a state bank yet who can indulge the idea that this government can rightfully by make a state bank its fiscal agent invest it with the absolute and unqualified power confer by this bill when i come to look at the detail of the bill they do not recommend it strongly to my adoption a brief notice of some of its provision will suffice
 first it may justify substantially a system of discount of the most objectionable character it be to deal in bill of exchange draw in one state and payable in another without any restraint the bill of exchange may have an unlimited time to run and its renewability be nowhere guard against it may in fact assume the most objectionable form of accommodation paper it be not require to rest on any actual real or substantial exchange basis a drawer in one place become the accepter in another and so in turn the accepter may become the drawer upon a mutual understanding it may at the same time indulge in mere local discount under the name of bill of exchange a bill draw at philadelphia on camden n.j. at new york on a border town in new jersey at cincinnati on newport in kentucky not to multiply other example might for anything in this bill to restrain it become a mere matter of local accommodation city thus relatively situated would possess advantage over city otherwise situate of so decide a character as most justly to excite dissatisfaction
 second there be no limit prescribe to the premium in the purchase of bill of exchange thereby correct none of the evil under which the community now labor and operate most injuriously upon the agricultural states in which the irregularity in the rate of exchange be most severely feel nor be these the only consequence a resumption of specie payment by the bank of those states would be liable to indefinite postponement for as the operation of the agency of the interior would chiefly consist in sell bill of exchange and the purchase could only be make in specie or the note of bank pay specie the state bank would either have to continue with their door close or exist at the mercy of this national monopoly of brokerage nor can it be pass over without remark that whilst the district of columbia be make the seat of the principal bank its citizen be exclude from all participation in any benefit it might afford by a positive prohibition on the bank from all discount within the district
 these be some of the objection which prominently exist against the detail of the bill other might be urge of much force but it would be unprofitable to dwell upon they suffice it to add that this charter be design to continue for twenty year without a competitor that the defect to which i have allude be found on the fundamental law of the corporation be irrevocable and that if the objection be well found it would be over hazardous to pass the bill into a law
 in conclusion i take leave most respectfully to say that i have feel the most anxious solicitude to meet the wish of congress in the adoption of a fiscal agent which avoid all constitutional objection should harmonize conflicting opinion actuate by this feeling i have be ready to yield much in a spirit of conciliation to the opinion of other and it be with great pain that i now feel compel to differ from congress a second time in the same session at the commencement of this session incline from choice to defer to the legislative will i submit to congress the propriety of adopt a fiscal agent which without violate the constitution would separate the public money from the executive control and perform the operation of the treasury without be burdensome to the people or inconvenient or expensive to the government it be deeply to be regret that this department of the government can not upon constitutional and other ground concur with the legislative department in this last measure propose to attain these desirable object owe to the brief space between the period of the death of my lamented predecessor and my own installation into office i be in fact not leave time to prepare and submit a definitive recommendation of my own in my regular message and since my mind have be wholly occupy in a most anxious attempt to conform my action to the legislative will in this communication i be confine by the constitution to my objection simply to this bill but the period of the regular session will soon arrive when it will be my duty under another clause of the constitution to give to congress information of the state of the union and recommend to their consideration such measure as i shall judge necessary and expedient and i most respectfully submit in a spirit of harmony whether the present difference of opinion should be press far at this time and whether the peculiarity of my situation do not entitle i to a postponement of this subject to a more auspicious period for deliberation the two houses of congress have distinguish themselves at this extraordinary session by the performance of an immense mass of labor at a season very unfavorable both to health and action and have pass many law which i trust will prove highly beneficial to the interest of the country and fully answer its just expectation it have be my good fortune and pleasure to concur with they in all measure except this and why should our difference on this alone be push to extreme it be my anxious desire that it should not be i too have be burden with extraordinary labor of late and i sincerely desire time for deep and deliberate reflection on this the great difficulty of my administration may we not now pause until a more favorable time when with the most anxious hope that the executive and congress may cordially unite some measure of finance may be deliberately adopt promotive of the good of our common country
 i will take this occasion to declare that the conclusion to which i have bring myself be those of a settle conviction found in my opinion on a just view of the constitution that in arrive at it i have be actuate by no other motive or desire than to uphold the institution of the country as they have come down to we from the hand of our godlike ancestor and that i shall esteem my effort to sustain they even though i perish more honorable than to win the applause of man by a sacrifice of my duty and my conscience

 if in great britain a power exist in the crown to cause to be enter a nolle prosequi which be not the case with the executive power of the united states upon a prosecution pende in a state court yet there no more than here can the chief executive power rescue a prisoner from custody without an order of the proper tribunal direct his discharge the precise stage of the proceeding at which such order may be make be a matter of municipal regulation exclusively and not to be complain of by any other government in case of this kind a government become politically responsible only when its tribunal of last resort be show to have render unjust and injurious judgment in matter not doubtful to the establishment and elucidation of this principle no nation have lend its authority more efficiently than great britain alexander mcleod have his option either to prosecute a writ of error from the decision of the supreme court of new york which have be render upon his application for a discharge to the supreme court of the united states or to submit his case to the decision of a jury prefer the latter deem it the readiest mode of obtain his liberation and the result have fully sustain the wisdom of his choice the manner in which the issue submit be try will satisfy the english government that the principle of justice will never fail to govern the enlightened decision of an american tribunal i can not fail however to suggest to congress the propriety and in some degree the necessity of make such provision by law so far as they may constitutionally do so for the removal at their commencement and at the option of the party of all such case as may hereafter arise and which may involve the faithful observance and execution of our international obligation from the state to the federal judiciary this government by our institution be charge with the maintenance of peace and the preservation of amicable relation with the nation of the earth and ought to possess without question all the reasonable and proper mean of maintain the one and preserve the other while just confidence be feel in the judiciary of the states yet this government ought to be competent in itself for the fulfillment of the high duty which have be devolve upon it under the organic law by the states themselves

 in the month of september a party of armed man from upper canada invade
 the territory of the united states and forcibly seize upon the person

 authority upon the fact of the case be bring to their knowledge a
 course of procedure which be to have be expect from a nation with
 whom we be at peace and which be not more due to the right of the united
 states than to its own regard for justice the correspondence which pass
 between the department of state and the british envoy mr. fox and with
 the governor of vermont as soon as the fact have be make known to this
 department be herewith communicate

 i regret that it be not in my power to make known to you an equally satisfactory conclusion in the case of the caroline steamer with the circumstance connect with the destruction of which in december 1837 by an armed force fit out in the province of upper canada you be already make acquainted no such atonement as be due for the public wrong do to the united states by this invasion of her territory so wholly irreconcilable with her right as an independent power have yet be make in the view take by this government the inquiry whether the vessel be in the employment of those who be prosecute an unauthorized war against that province or be engage by the owner in the business of transport passenger to and from navy island in hope of private gain which be most probably the case in no degree alter the real question at issue between the two government this government can never concede to any foreign government the power except in a case of the most urgent and extreme necessity of invade its territory either to arrest the person or destroy the property of those who may have violate the municipal law of such foreign government or have disregard their obligation arise under the law of nation the territory of the united states must be regard as sacredly secure against all such invasion until they shall voluntarily acknowledge their inability to acquit themselves of their duty to other and in announce this sentiment i do but affirm a principle which no nation on earth would be more ready to vindicate at all hazard than the people and government of great britain if upon a full investigation of all the fact it shall appear that the owner of the caroline be govern by a hostile intent or have make common cause with those who be in the occupancy of navy island then so far as he be concerned there can be no claim to indemnity for the destruction of his boat which this government would feel itself bind to prosecute since he would have act not only in derogation of the right of great britain but in clear violation of the law of the united states but that be a question which however settle in no manner involve the high consideration of the violation of territorial sovereignty and jurisdiction to recognize it as an admissible practice that each government in its turn upon any sudden and unauthorized outbreak which on a frontier the extent of which render it impossible for either to have an efficient force on every mile of it and which outbreak therefore neither may be able to suppress in a day may take vengeance into its own hand and without even a remonstrance and in the absence of any pressing or overruling necessity may invade the territory of the other would inevitably lead to result equally to be deplore by both when border collision come to receive the sanction or to be make on the authority of either government general war must be the inevitable result while it be the ardent desire of the united states to cultivate the relation of peace with all nation and to fulfill all the duty of good neighborhood toward those who possess territory adjoin their own that very desire would lead they to deny the right of any foreign power to invade their boundary with an armed force the correspondence between the two government on this subject will at a future day of your session be submit to your consideration and in the meantime i can not but indulge the hope that the british government will see the propriety of renounce as a rule of future action the precedent which have be set in the affair at schlosser

 i herewith submit the correspondence which have recently take place between the american minister at the court of st. james mr. stevenson and the minister of foreign affair of that government on the right claim by that government to visit and detain vessel sail under the american flag and engage in prosecute lawful commerce in the african sea our commercial interest in that region have experience considerable increase and have become an object of much importance and it be the duty of this government to protect they against all improper and vexatious interruption however desirous the united states may be for the suppression of the slave trade they can not consent to interpolation into the maritime code at the mere will and pleasure of other government we deny the right of any such interpolation to any one or all the nation of the earth without our consent we claim to have a voice in all amendment or alteration of that code and when we be give to understand as in this instance by a foreign government that its treaty with other nation can not be execute without the establishment and enforcement of new principle of maritime police to be apply without our consent we must employ a language neither of equivocal import or susceptible of misconstruction american citizen prosecute a lawful commerce in the african sea under the flag of their country be not responsible for the abuse or unlawful use of that flag by other nor can they rightfully on account of any such allege abuse be interrupt molest or detain while on the ocean and if thus molest and detain while pursue honest voyage in the usual way and violate no law themselves they be unquestionably entitle to indemnity this government have manifest its repugnance to the slave trade in a manner which can not be misunderstood by its fundamental law it prescribe limit in point of time to its continuance and against its own citizen who might so far forget the right of humanity as to engage in that wicked traffic it have long since by its municipal law denounce the most condign punishment many of the states compose this union have make appeal to the civilized world for its suppression long before the moral sense of other nation have become shocked by the iniquity of the traffic whether this government should now enter into treaty contain mutual stipulation upon this subject be a question for its mature deliberation certain it be that if the right to detain american ship on the high sea can be justify on the plea of a necessity for such detention arise out of the existence of treaty between other nation the same plea may be extend and enlarge by the new stipulation of new treaty to which the united states may not be a party this government will not cease to urge upon that of great britain full and ample remuneration for all loss whether arise from detention or otherwise to which american citizen have heretofore be or may hereafter be subject by the exercise of right which this government can not recognize as legitimate and proper nor will i indulge a doubt but that the sense of justice of great britain will constrain she to make retribution for any wrong or loss which any american citizen engage in the prosecution of lawful commerce may have experience at the hand of her cruiser or other public authority this government at the same time will relax no effort to prevent its citizen if there be any so disposed from prosecute a traffic so revolt to the feeling of humanity it seek to do no more than to protect the fair and honest trader from molestation and injury but while the enterprise mariner engage in the pursuit of an honorable trade be entitle to its protection it will visit with condign punishment other of an opposite character

 should it be necessary in any view that congress may take of the subject to revise the exist tariff of duty i beg leave to say that in the performance of that most delicate operation moderate counsel would seem to be the wise the government under which it be our happiness to live owe its existence to the spirit of compromise which prevail among its framer jarring and discordant opinion could only have be reconcile by that noble spirit of patriotism which prompt conciliation and result in harmony in the same spirit the compromise bill as it be commonly call be adopt at the session of 1833 while the people of no portion of the union will ever hesitate to pay all necessary taxis for the support of government yet an innate repugnance exist to the imposition of burthen not really necessary for that object in impose duty however for the purpose of revenue a right to discriminate as to the article on which the duty shall be lay as well as the amount necessarily and most properly exist otherwise the government would be place in the condition of have to levy the same duty upon all article the productive as well as the unproductive the slight duty upon some might have the effect of cause their importation to cease whereas other enter extensively into the consumption of the country might bear the heavy without any sensible diminution in the amount import so also the government may be justify in so discriminate by reference to other consideration of domestic policy connect with our manufacture so long as the duty shall be lay with distinct reference to the want of the treasury no well round objection can exist against they it might be esteem desirable that no such augmentation of the taxis should take place as would have the effect of annul the land proceed distribution act of the last session which act be declare to be inoperative the moment the duty be increase beyond 20 per cent the maximum rate establish by the compromise act some of the provision of the compromise act which will go into effect on the 30th day of june next may however be find exceedingly inconvenient in practice under any regulation that congress may adopt i refer more particularly to that relate to the home valuation a difference in value of the same article to some extent will necessarily exist at different port but that be altogether insignificant when compare with the conflict in valuation which be likely to arise from the difference of opinion among the numerous appraiser of merchandise in many instance the estimate of value must be conjectural and thus as many different rate of value may be establish as there be appraiser these difference in valuation may also be increase by the inclination which without the slight imputation on their honesty may arise on the part of the appraiser in favor of their respective port of entry i recommend this whole subject to the consideration of congress with a single additional remark certainty and permanency in any system of governmental policy be in all respect eminently desirable but more particularly be this true in all that affect trade and commerce the operation of which depend much more on the certainty of their return and calculation which embrace distant period of time than on high bounty or duty which be liable to constant fluctuation

 at your late session i invite your attention to the condition of the currency and exchange and urge the necessity of adopt such measure as be consistent with the constitutional competency of the government in order to correct the unsoundness of the one and as far as practicable the inequality of the other no country can be in the enjoyment of its full measure of prosperity without the presence of a medium of exchange approximate to uniformity of value what be necessary as between the different nation of the earth be also important as between the inhabitant of different part of the same country with the first the precious metal constitute the chief medium of circulation and such also would be the case as to the last but for invention comparatively modern which have furnish in place of gold and silver a paper circulation i do not propose to enter into a comparative analysis of the merit of the two system such belong more properly to the period of the introduction of the paper system the speculative philosopher might find inducement to prosecute the inquiry but his research could only lead he to conclude that the paper system have probably well never have be introduce and that society might have be much happy without it the practical statesman have a very different task to perform he have to look at thing as they be to take they as he find they to supply deficiency and to prune excess as far as in he lie the task of furnish a corrective for derangement of the paper medium with we be almost inexpressibly great the power exert by the states to charter banking corporation and which having be carry to a great excess have fill the country with in most of the states an irredeemable paper medium be an evil which in some way or other require a corrective the rate at which bill of exchange be negotiate between different part of the country furnish an index of the value of the local substitute for gold and silver which be in many part so far depreciate as not to be receive except at a large discount in payment of debt or in the purchase of produce it could earnestly be desire that every bank not possess the mean of resumption should follow the example of the late united states bank of pennsylvania and go into liquidation rather than by refuse to do so to continue embarrassment in the way of solvent institution thereby augment the difficulty incident to the present condition of thing whether this government with due regard to the right of the states have any power to constrain the bank either to resume specie payment or to force they into liquidation be an inquiry which will not fail to claim your consideration in view of the great advantage which be allow the corporator not among the least of which be the authority contain in most of their charter to make loan to three time the amount of their capital thereby often derive three time as much interest on the same amount of money as any individual be permit by law to receive no sufficient apology can be urge for a long continue suspension of specie payment such suspension be productive of the great detriment to the public by expel from circulation the precious metal and seriously hazard the success of any effort that this government can make to increase commercial facility and to advance the public interest

 this be the more to be regret and the indispensable necessity for a sound currency become the more manifest when we reflect on the vast amount of the internal commerce of the country of this we have no statistic nor just datum for form adequate opinion but there can be no doubt but that the amount of transportation coastwise by sea and the transportation inland by railroad and canal and by steamboat and other mode of conveyance over the surface of our vast river and immense lake and the value of property carry and interchange by these mean form a general aggregate to which the foreign commerce of the country large as it be make but a distant approach

 in the absence of any control power over this subject which by force a general resumption of specie payment would at once have the effect of restore a sound medium of exchange and would leave to the country but little to desire what measure of relief fall within the limit of our constitutional competency do it become this government to adopt it be my painful duty at your last session under the weight of most solemn obligation to differ with congress on the measure which it propose for my approval and which it doubtless regard as corrective of exist evil subsequent reflection and event since occur have only serve to confirm i in the opinion then entertain and frankly express i must be permit to add that no scheme of governmental policy unaide by individual exertion can be available for ameliorate the present condition of thing commercial mode of exchange and a good currency be but the necessary mean of commerce and intercourse not the direct productive source of wealth wealth can only be accumulate by the earning of industry and the saving of frugality and nothing can be more ill judge than to look to facility in borrow or to a redundant circulation for the power of discharge pecuniary obligation the country be full of resource and the people fall of energy and the great and permanent remedy for present embarrassment must be seek in industry economy the observance of good faith and the favorable influence of time in pursuance of a pledge give to you in my last message to congress which pledge i urge as an apology for adventure to present you the detail of any plan the secretary of the treasury will be ready to submit to you should you require it a plan of finance which while it throw around the public treasure reasonable guard for its protection and rest on power acknowledge in practice to exist from the origin of the government will at the same time furnish to the country a sound paper medium and afford all reasonable facility for regulate the exchange when submit you will perceive in it a plan amendatory of the exist law in relation to the treasury department subordinate in all respect to the will of congress directly and the will of the people indirectly self sustain should it be find in practice to realize its promise in theory and repealable at the pleasure of congress it propose by effectual restraint and by invoke the true spirit of our institution to separate the purse from the sword or more properly to speak deny any other control to the president over the agent who may be select to carry it into execution but what may be indispensably necessary to secure the fidelity of such agent and by wise regulation keep plainly apart from each other private and public fund it contemplate the establishment of a board of control at the seat of government with agency at prominent commercial point or wherever else congress shall direct for the safe keeping and disbursement of the public money and a substitution at the option of the public creditor of treasury note in lieu of gold and silver it propose to limit the issue to an amount not to exceed $ 15,000,000 without the express sanction of the legislative power it also authorize the receipt of individual deposit of gold and silver to a limited amount and the grant certificate of deposit divide into such sum as may be call for by the depositor it proceed a step far and authorize the purchase and sale of domestic bill and draft rest on a real and substantial basis payable at sight or have but a short time to run and draw on place not less than 100 mile apart which authority except in so far as may be necessary for government purpose exclusively be only to be exert upon the express condition that its exercise shall not be prohibit by the state in which the agency be situate in order to cover the expense incident to the plan it will be authorize to receive moderate premium for certificate issue on deposit and on bill buy and sell and thus as far as its dealing extend to furnish facility to commercial intercourse at the low possible rate and to subduct from the earning of industry the least possible sum it use the state bank at a distance from the agency as auxiliary without impart any power to trade in its name it be subject to such guard and restraint as have appear to be necessary it be the creature of law and exist only at the pleasure of the legislature it be make to rest on an actual specie basis in order to redeem the note at the place of issue produce no dangerous redundancy of circulation afford no temptation to speculation be attend by no inflation of price be equable in its operation make the treasury note which it may use along with the certificate of deposit and the note of specie pay bank convertible at the place where collect receivable in payment of government due and without violate any principle of the constitution afford the government and the people such facility as be call for by the want of both such it have appear to i be its recommendation and in view of they it will be submit whenever you may require it to your consideration

 i be not able to perceive that any fair and candid objection can be urge against the plan the principal outline of which i have thus present i can not doubt but that the note which it propose to furnish at the voluntary option of the public creditor issue in lieu of the revenue and its certificate of deposit will be maintain at an equality with gold and silver everywhere they be redeemable in gold and silver on demand at the place of issue they be receivable everywhere in payment of government due the treasury note be limit to an amount of one fourth less than the estimate annual receipt of the treasury and in addition they rest upon the faith of the government for their redemption if all these assurance be not sufficient to make they available then the idea as it seem to i of furnish a sound paper medium of exchange may be entirely abandon

 if a fear be indulge that the government may be tempt to run into excess in its issue at any future day it seem to i that no such apprehension can reasonably be entertain until all confidence in the representative of the states and of the people as well as of the people themselves shall be lose the weighty consideration of policy require that the restraint now propose to be throw around the measure should not for light cause be remove to argue against any propose plan its liability to possible abuse be to reject every expedient since everything dependent on human action be liable to abuse fifteen million of treasury note may be issue as the maximum but a discretionary power be to be give to the board of control under that sum and every consideration will unite in lead they to feel their way with caution for the first eight year of the existence of the late bank of the united states its circulation barely exceed $ 4,000,000 and for five of its most prosperous year it be about equal to $ 16,000,000 furthermore the authority give to receive private deposit to a limited amount and to issue certificate in such sum as may be call for by the depositor may so far fill up the channel of circulation as greatly to diminish the necessity of any considerable issue of treasury note a restraint upon the amount of private deposit have seem to be indispensably necessary from an apprehension think to be well found that in any emergency of trade confidence might be so far shake in the bank as to induce a withdrawal from they of private deposit with a view to insure their unquestionable safety when deposit with the government which might prove eminently disastrous to the state bank be it object that it be propose to authorize the agency to deal in bill of exchange it be answer that such dealing be to be carry on at the low possible premium be make to rest on an unquestionably sound basis be design to reimburse merely the expense which would otherwise devolve upon the treasury and be in strict subordination to the decision of the supreme court in the case of the bank of augusta against earle and other report case and thereby avoid all conflict with state jurisdiction which i hold to be indispensably requisite it leave the banking privilege of the states without interference look to the treasury and the union and while furnish every facility to the first be careful of the interest of the last but above all it be create by law be amendable by law and be repealable by law and wed as i be to no theory but look solely to the advancement of the public good i shall be among the very first to urge its repeal if it be find not to subserve the purpose and object for which it may be create nor will the plan be submit in any overweening confidence in the sufficiency of my own judgment but with much great reliance on the wisdom and patriotism of congress i can not abandon this subject without urge upon you in the most emphatic manner whatever may be your action on the suggestion which i have feel it to be my duty to submit to relieve the chief executive magistrate by any and all constitutional mean from a control power over the public treasury if in the plan propose should you deem it worthy of your consideration that separation be not as complete as you may desire you will doubtless amend it in that particular for myself i disclaim all desire to have any control over the public money other than what be indispensably necessary to execute the law which you may pass

 nor can i fail to advert in this connection to the debt which many of the states of the union have contract abroad and under which they continue to labor that indebtedness amount to a sum not less than $ 200,000,000 and which have be retribute to they for the most part in work of internal improvement which be destine to prove of vast importance in ultimately advance their prosperity and wealth for the debt thus contract the states be alone responsible i can do not more than express the belief that each state will feel itself bind by every consideration of honor as well as of interest to meet its engagement with punctuality the failure however of any one state to do so should in no degree affect the credit of the rest and the foreign capitalist will have no just cause to experience alarm as to all other state stock because any one or more of the states may neglect to provide with punctuality the mean of redeem their engagement even such state should there be any consider the great rapidity with which their resource be develop themselves will not fail to have the mean at no very distant day to redeem their obligation to the uttermost farthing nor will i doubt but that in view of that honorable conduct which have evermore govern the states and the people of the union they will each and all resort to every legitimate expedient before they will forego a faithful compliance with their obligation

 from the report of the secretary of war and other report accompany it you will be inform of the progress which have be make in the fortification design for the protection of our principal city roadstead and inland frontier during the present year together with their true state and condition they will be prosecute to completion with all the expedition which the mean place by congress at the disposal of the executive will allow

 i recommend particularly to your consideration that portion of the secretary&#39;s report which propose the establishment of a chain of military post from council bluffs to some point on the pacific ocean within our limit the benefit thereby destine to accrue to our citizen engage in the fur trade over that wilderness region add to the importance of cultivate friendly relation with savage tribe inhabit it and at the same time of give protection to our frontier settlement and of establish the mean of safe intercourse between the american settlement at the mouth of the columbia river and those on this side of the rocky mountains would seem to suggest the importance of carry into effect the recommendation upon this head with as little delay as may be practicable

 the report of the secretary of the navy will place you in possession of the present condition of that important arm of the national defense every effort will be make to add to its efficiency and i can not too strongly urge upon you liberal appropriation to that branch of the public service inducement of the weighty character exist for the adoption of this course of policy our extended and otherwise expose maritime frontier call for protection to the furnishing of which an efficient naval force be indispensable we look to no foreign conquest nor do we propose to enter into competition with any other nation for supremacy on the ocean but it be due not only to the honor but to the security of the people of the united states that no nation should be permit to invade our water at pleasure and subject our town and village to conflagration or pillage economy in all branch of the public service be due from all the public agent to the people but parsimony alone would suggest the withholding of the necessary mean for the protection of our domestic fireside from invasion and our national honor from disgrace i would most earnestly recommend to congress to abstain from all appropriation for object not absolutely necessary but i take upon myself without a moment of hesitancy all the responsibility of recommend the increase and prompt equipment of that gallant navy which have light up every sea with its victory and spread an imperishable glory over the country

 the report of the postmaster general will claim your particular attention not only because of the valuable suggestion which it contain but because of the great importance which at all time attach to that interesting branch of the public service the increase expense of transport the mail along the principal route necessarily claim the public attention and have awaken a corresponding solicitude on the part of the government the transmission of the mail must keep pace with those facility of intercommunication which be every day become great through the building of railroad and the application of steam power but it can not be disguise that in order to do so the post office department be subject to heavy exaction the line of communication between distant part of the union be to a great extent occupy by railroad which in the nature of thing possess a complete monopoly and the department be therefore liable to heavy and unreasonable charge this evil be destine to great increase in future and some timely measure may become necessary to guard against it

 i feel it my duty to bring under your consideration a practice which have grow up in the administration of the government and which i be deeply convinced ought to be correct i allude to the exercise of the power which usage rather than reason have vest in the president of remove incumbent from office in order to substitute other more in favor with the dominant party my own conduct in this respect have be govern by a conscientious purpose to exercise the remove power only in case of unfaithfulness or inability or in those in which its exercise appear necessary in order to discountenance and suppress that spirit of active partisanship on the part of holder of office which not only withdraw they from the steady and impartial discharge of their official duty but exert an undue and injurious influence over election and degrade the character of the government itself inasmuch as it exhibit the chief magistrate as be a party through his agent in the secret plot or open working of political party

 in respect to the exercise of this power nothing should be leave to discretion which may safely be regulate by law and it be of high importance to restrain as far as possible the stimulus of personal interest in public election consider the great increase which have be make in public office in the last quarter of a century and the probability of further increase we incur the hazard of witness violent political contest direct too often to the single object of retain office by those who be in or obtain it by those who be out under the influence of these conviction i shall cordially concur in any constitutional measure for regulate and by regulate restrain the power of removal

 i suggest for your consideration the propriety of make without far delay some specific application of the fund derive under the will of mr. smithson of england for the diffusion of knowledge and which have heretofore be vest in public stock until such time as congress should think proper to give they a specific direction nor will you i feel confident permit any abatement of the principal of the legacy to be make should it turn out that the stock in which the investment have be make have undergo a depreciation

 in conclusion i commend to your care the interest of this district for which you be the exclusive legislator consider that this city be the residence of the government and for a large part of the year of congress and consider also the great cost of the public building and the propriety of afford they at all time careful protection it seem not unreasonable that congress should contribute toward the expense of an efficient police
to the senate and house of representatives of the united states
 notwithstanding the urgency with which i have on more than one occasion feel it my duty to press upon congress the necessity of provide the government with the mean of discharge its debt and maintain inviolate the public faith the increase embarrassment of the treasury impose upon i the indispensable obligation of again invite your most serious attention to the condition of the finance fortunately for myself in thus bring this important subject to your view for a deliberate and comprehensive examination in all its bearing and i trust i may add for a final adjustment of it to the common advantage of the whole union i be permit to approach it with perfect freedom and candor as few of the burden for which provision be now require to be make have be bring upon the country during my short administration of its affair i have neither motive nor wish to make they a matter of crimination against any of my predecessor i be disposed to regard as i be bind to treat they as fact which can not now be undo and as deeply interesting to we all and equally impose upon all the most solemn duty and the only use i would make of the error of the past be by a careful examination of their cause and character to avoid if possible the repetition of they in future the condition of the country indeed be such as may well arrest the conflict of party the conviction seem at length to have make its way to the mind of all that the disproportion between the public responsibility and the mean provide for meet they be no casual nor transient evil it be on the contrary one which for some year to come notwithstanding a resort to all reasonable retrenchment and the constant progress of the country in population and productive power must continue to increase under exist law unless we consent to give up or impair all our defense in war and peace but this be a thought which i be persuade no patriotic mind would for a moment entertain without affect an alarm which i do not feel in regard to our foreign relation it may safely be affirm that they be in a state too critical and involve too many momentous issue to permit we to neglect in the least much less to abandon entirely those mean of assert our right without which negotiation be without dignity and peace without security
 in the report of the secretary of the treasury submit to congress at the commencement of the present session it be estimate that after exhaust all the probable resource of the year there will remain a deficit of about $ 14,000,000 with a view partly to a permanent system of revenue and partly to immediate relief from actual embarrassment that officer recommend together with a plan for establish a government exchequer some expedient of a more temporary character viz the issuing of treasury note and the extension of the time for which the loan authorize to be negotiate by the act of the last session should be take congress accordingly provide for an issue of treasury note to the amount of $ 5,000,000 but subject to the condition that they should not be pay away below par
 no measure connect with the last of the two object above mention be introduce until recently into the house of representatives should the loan bill now pende before that body pass into a law for its present amount there would still remain a deficit of $ 2,500,000 it require no argument to show that such a condition of the treasury be incompatible not only with a high state of public credit but with anything approach to efficiency in the conduct of public affair it must be obvious even to the most inexperienced mind that to say nothing of any particular exigency actual or imminent there should be at all time in the treasury of a great nation with a view to contingency of ordinary occurrence a surplus at least equal in amount to the above deficiency but that deficiency serious as it would be in itself will i be compel to say rather be increase than diminish without the adoption of measure adequate to correct the evil at once the stagnation of trade and business in some degree incident to the derangement of the national finance and the state of the revenue law hold out but little prospect of relief in the ordinary course of thing for some time to come
 under such circumstance i be deeply impressed with the necessity of meet the crisis with a vigor and decision which it imperatively demand at the hand of all intrust with the conduct of public affair the gravity of the evil call for a remedy proportion to it no slight palliative or occasional expedient will give the country the relief it need such measure on the contrary will in the end as be now manifest to all too surely multiply its embarrassment rely as i be bind to do on the representative of a people render illustrious among nation by having pay off its whole public debt i shall not shrink from the responsibility impose upon i by the constitution of point out such measure as will in my opinion insure adequate relief i be the more encouraged to recommend the course which necessity exact by the confidence which i have in its complete success the resource of the country in everything that constitute the wealth and strength of nation be so abundant the spirit of a most industrious enterprising and intelligent people be so energetic and elastic that the government will be without the shadow of excuse for its delinquency if the difficulty which now embarrass it be not speedily and effectually remove
 from present indication it be hardly doubtful that congress will find it necessary to lay additional duty on import in order to meet the ordinary current expense of the government in the exercise of a sound discrimination have reference to revenue but at the same time necessarily afford incidental protection to manufacturing industry it seem equally probable that duty on some article of importation will have to be advance above 20 per cent in perform this important work of revise the tariff of duty which in the present emergency would seem to be indispensable i can not too strongly recommend the cultivation of a spirit of mutual harmony and concession to which the government itself owe its origin and without the continue exercise of which jarring and discord would universally prevail
 an additional reason for the increase of duty in some instance beyond the rate of 20 per cent will exist in fulfil the recommendation already make and now repeat of make adequate appropriation for the defense of the country
 by the express provision of the act distribute the proceed of the sale of the public land among the states its operation be ipso facto to cease so soon as the rate of the duty shall exceed the limit prescribe in the act
 in recommend the adoption of measure for distribute the proceed of the public land among the states at the commencement of the last session of congress such distribution be urge by argument and consideration which appear to i then and appear to i now of great weight and be place on the condition that it should not render necessary any departure from the act of 1833 it be with sincere regret that i now perceive the necessity of depart from that act because i be well aware that expectation justly entertain by some of the states will be disappoint by any occasion which shall withhold from they the proceed of the land but the condition be plainly express in the message and be insert in term equally plain in the law itself and amidst the embarrassment which surround the country on all side and beset both the general and the state government it appear to i that the object first and high in importance be to establish the credit of this government and to place it on durable foundation and thus afford the most effectual support to the credit of the states equal at least to what it would receive from a direct distribution of the proceed of the sale of the public land
 when the distribution law be pass there be reason to anticipate that there soon would be a real surplus to distribute on that assumption it be in my opinion a wise a just and a beneficent measure but to continue it in force while there be no such surplus to distribute and when it be manifestly necessary not only to increase the duty but at the same time to borrow money in order to liquidate the public debt and disembarrass the public treasury would cause it to be regard as an unwise alienation of the good security of the public creditor which would with difficulty be excuse and could not be justify
 cause of no ordinary character have recently depress american credit in the stock market of the world to a degree quite unprecedented i need scarcely mention the condition of the banking institution of some of the states the vast amount of foreign debt contract during a period of wild speculation by corporation and individual and above all the doctrine of repudiation of contract solemnly enter into by states which although as yet apply only under circumstance of a peculiar character and generally rebuke with severity by the moral sense of the community be yet so very licentious and in a government depend wholly on opinion so very alarming that the impression make by it to our disadvantage as a people be anything but surprising under such circumstance it be imperatively due from we to the people whom we represent that when we go into the money market to contract a loan we should tender such security as to cause the money lender as well at home as abroad to feel that the most propitious opportunity be afford he of invest profitably and judiciously his capital a government which have pay off the debt of two war wage with the most powerful nation of modern time should not be bring to the necessity of chaffer for term in the money market under such circumstance as i have advert to our object should be to produce with the capitalist a feeling of entire confidence by a tender of that sort of security which in all time past have be esteem sufficient and which for the small amount of our propose indebtedness will unhesitatingly be regard as amply adequate while a pledge of all the revenue amount to no more than be imply in every instance when the government contract a debt and although it ought in ordinary circumstance to be entirely satisfactory yet in time like these the capitalist would feel well satisfied with the pledge of a specific fund ample in magnitude to the payment of his interest and ultimate reimbursement of his principal such be the character of the land fund the most vigilant money dealer will readily perceive that not only will his interest be secure on such a pledge but that a debt of $ 18,000,000 or $ 20,000,000 would by the surplus of sale over and above the payment of the interest be extinguish within any reasonable time fix for its redemption to relieve the treasury from its embarrassment and to aid in meet its requisition until time be allow for any new tariff of duty to become available it would seem to be necessary to fund a debt approach to $ 15,000,000 and in order to place the negotiation of the loan beyond a reasonable doubt i submit to congress whether the proceed of the sale of the public land should not be pledge for the payment of the interest and the secretary of the treasury be authorize out of the surplus of the proceed of such sale to purchase the stock when it can be procure on such term as will render it beneficial in that way to extinguish the debt and prevent the accumulation of such surplus while its distribution be suspend
 no one can doubt that be the federal treasury now as prosperous as it be ten year ago and its fiscal operation conduct by an efficient agency of its own coextensive with the union the embarrassment of the states and corporation in they would produce even if they continue as they be be that possible effect far less disastrous than those now experienced it be the disorder here at the heart and center of the system that paralyze and derange every part of it who do not know the permanent importance not to the federal government alone but to every state and every individual within its jurisdiction even in their most independent and isolated individual pursuit of the preservation of a sound state of public opinion and a judicious administration here the sympathy be instantaneous and universal to attempt to remedy the evil of the derange credit and currency of the states while the disease be allow to rage in the vital of this government would be a hopeless undertaking
 it be the full conviction of this truth which embolden i most earnestly to recommend to your early and serious consideration the measure now submit to your well judgment as well as those to which your attention have be already invite the first great want of the country that without answer which all attempt at better the present condition of thing will prove fruitless be a complete restoration of the credit and finance of the federal government the source and foundation of all credit be in the confidence which the government inspire and just in proportion as that confidence shall be shake or diminish will be the distrust among all class of the community and the derangement and demoralization in every branch of business and all the interest of the country keep up the standard of good faith and punctuality in the operation of the general government and all partial irregularity and disorder will be rectify by the influence of its example but suffer that standard to be debase or disturb and it be impossible to foresee to what a degree of degradation and confusion all financial interest public and private may sink in such a country as this the representative of the people have only to will it and the public credit will be as high as it ever be
 my own view of the measure calculate to effect this great and desirable object i have thus frankly express to congress under circumstance which give to the entire subject a peculiar and solemn interest the executive can do no more if the credit of the country be expose to question if the public defense be break down or weaken if the whole administration of public affair be embarrassed for want of the necessary mean for conduct they with vigor and effect i trust that this department of the government will be find to have do all that be in its power to avert such evil and will be acquit of all just blame on account of they

to the senate and house of representatives
 the season for active hostility in florida having nearly terminate my attention have necessarily be direct to the course of measure to be pursue hereafter in relation to the few indians yet remain in that territory their number be believe not to exceed 240 of whom there be suppose to be about 80 warrior or male capable of bear arm the further pursuit of these miserable being by a large military force seem to be as injudicious as it be unavaile the history of the last year&#39;s campaign in florida have satisfactorily show that notwithstanding the vigorous and incessant operation of our troop which can not be exceed the indian mode of warfare their dispersed condition and the very smallness of their number which increase the difficulty of find they in the abundant and almost inaccessible hiding place of the territory render any further attempt to secure they by force impracticable except by the employment of the most expensive mean the exhibition of force and the constant effort to capture or destroy they of course place they beyond the reach of overture to surrender it be believe by the distinguished officer in command there that a different system should now be pursue to attain the entire removal of all the indians in florida and he recommend that hostility should cease unless the renewal of they be render necessary by new aggression that communication should be open by mean of the indians with he to insure they a peaceful and voluntary surrender and that the military operation should hereafter be direct to the protection of the inhabitant
 these view be strengthen and corroborate by the governor of the territory by many of its most intelligent citizen and by numerous officer of the army who have serve and be still serve in that region mature reflection have satisfy i that these recommendation be sound and just and i rejoice that consistently with duty to florida i may indulge my desire to promote the great interest of humanity and extend the reign of peace and good will by terminate the unhappy warfare that have so long be carry on there and at the same time gratify my anxiety to reduce the demand upon the treasury by curtail the extraordinary expense which have attend the contest i have therefore authorize the colonel in command there as soon as he shall deem it expedient to declare that hostility against the indians have cease and that they will not be renew unless provoke and render indispensable by new outrage on their part but that neither citizen nor troop be to be restrain from any necessary and proper act of self defense against any attempt to molest they he be instruct to open communication with those yet remain and endeavor by all peaceable mean to persuade they to consult their true interest by join their brother at the west and direction have be give for establish a cordon or line of protection for the inhabitant by the necessary number of troop
 but to render this system of protection effectual it be essential that settlement of our citizen should be make within the line so establish and that they should be arm so as to be ready to repel any attack in order to afford inducement to such settlement i submit to the consideration of congress the propriety of allow a reasonable quantity of land to the head of each family that shall permanently occupy it and of extend the exist provision on that subject so as to permit the issue of ration for the subsistence of the settler for one year and as few of they will probably be provide with arm it would be expedient to authorize the loan of musket and the delivery of a proper quantity of cartridge or of powder and ball by such mean it be to be hope that a hardy population will soon occupy the rich soil of the frontier of florida who will be as capable as willing to defend themselves and their house and thus relieve the government from further anxiety or expense for their protection

to the house of representatives of the united states
 it be with unfeigned regret that i find myself under the necessity of return to the house of representatives with my objection a bill entitle an act to provide revenue from import and to change and modify exist law impose duty on import and for other purpose nothing can be more painful to any individual call upon to perform the chief executive duty under our limited constitution than to be constrain to withhold his assent from an important measure adopt by the legislature yet he would neither fulfill the high purpose of his station nor consult the true interest or the solemn will of the people the common constituent of both branch of the government by yield his well consider most deeply fix and repeatedly declare opinion on matter of great public concernment to those of a coordinate department without request that department seriously to reexamine the subject of their difference the exercise of some independence of judgment in regard to all act of legislation be plainly imply in the responsibility of approve they at all time a duty it become a peculiarly solemn and imperative one when the subject pass upon by congress happen to involve as in the present instance the most momentous issue to affect variously the various part of a great country and to have give rise in all quarter to such a conflict of opinion as to render it impossible to conjecture with any certainty on which side the majority really be surely if the pause for reflection intend by the wise author of the constitution by refer the subject back to congress for reconsideration be ever expedient and necessary it be precisely such a case as the present
 on the subject of distribute the proceed of the sale of the public land in the exist state of the finance it have be my duty to make know my settle conviction on various occasion during the present session of congress at the opening of the extra session upward of twelve month ago share fully in the general hope of return prosperity and credit i recommend such a distribution but that recommendation be even then expressly couple with the condition that the duty on import should not exceed the rate of 20 per cent provide by the compromise act of 1833 these hope be not a little encouraged and these view strengthen by the report of mr. ewing then secretary of the treasury which be shortly thereafter lay before congress in which he recommend the imposition of duty at the rate of 20 per cent ad valorem on all free article with specified exception and state if this measure be adopt there will be receive in the treasury from custom in the last quarter of the present year $ 5,300,000 in all of the year 1842 about $ 22,500,000 and in the year 1843 after the final reduction under the act of march 2 1833 about $ 20,800,000 and add
 it be believe that after the heavy expenditure require by the public service in the present year shall have be provide for the revenue which will accrue from that or a nearly approximate rate of duty will be sufficient to defray the expense of the government and leave a surplus to be annually apply to the gradual payment of the national debt leave the proceed of the public land to be dispose of as congress shall see fit
 i be most happy that congress at the time seem entirely to concur in the recommendation of the executive and anticipate the correctness of the secretary&#39;s conclusion and in view of an actual surplus pass the distribution act of the 4th september last wisely limit its operation by two condition have reference both of they to a possible state of the treasury different from that which have be anticipate by the secretary of the treasury and to the paramount necessity of the public service it ordain that if at any time during the existence of that act there should be an imposition of duty on import inconsistent with the provision of the act of the 2d march 1833 and beyond the rate of duty fix by that act to wit 20 per cent on the value of such import or any of they then the distribution should be suspend and should continue so suspend until that cause should be remove by a previous clause it have in a like spirit of wise and cautious patriotism provide for another case in which all be even now agree that the proceed of the sale of the public land should be use for the defense of the country it be enact that the act should continue and be in force until otherwise provide by law unless the united states should become involved in war with any foreign power in which event from the commencement of hostility the act should be suspend until the cessation of hostility
 not long after the opening of the present session of congress the unprecedented and extraordinary difficulty that have recently embarrass the finance of the country begin to assume a serious aspect it soon become quite evident that the hope under which the act of 4th september be pass and which alone justify it in the eye either of congress who impose or of the executive who approve the first of the two condition just recite be not destine to be fulfil under the pressure therefore of the embarrassment which have thus unexpectedly arise it appear to i that the course to be pursue have be clearly mark out for the government by that act itself the condition contemplate in it as require a suspension of its operation have occur it become necessary in the opinion of all to raise the rate of duty upon import above 20 per cent and with a view both to provide available mean to meet present exigency and to lay the foundation for a successful negotiation of a loan i feel it incumbent on i to urge upon congress to raise the duty accordingly impose they in a spirit of a wise discrimination for the twofold object of afford ample revenue for the government and incidental protection to the various branch of domestic industry i also press in the most emphatic but respectful language i could employ the necessity of make the land sale available to the treasury as the basis of public credit i do not think that i could stand excuse much less justified before the people of the united states nor could i reconcile it to myself to recommend the imposition of additional taxis upon they without at the same time urge the employment of all the legitimate mean of the government toward satisfy its want these opinion be communicate in advance of any definitive action of congress on the subject either of the tariff or land sale under a high sense of public duty and in compliance with an express injunction of the constitution so that if a collision extremely to be deprecate as such collision always be have seemingly arise between the executive and legislative branch of the government it have assuredly not be owe to any capricious interference or to any want of a plain and frank declaration of opinion on the part of the former congress differ in its view with those of the executive as it have undoubtedly a right to do and pass a bill virtually for a time repeal the proviso of the act of the 4th september 1841 the bill be return to the house in which it originate with my objection to its become a law with a view to prevent if possible an open disagreement of opinion on a point so important i take occasion to declare that i regard it as an indispensable prerequisite to an increase of duty above 20 per cent that the act of the 4th september should remain unrepealed in its provision my reason for that opinion be elaborately set forth in the message which accompany the return of the bill which no constitutional majority appear to have be find for pass into a law
 the bill which be now before i propose in its twenty seventh section the total repeal of one of the provisos in the act of september and while it increase the duty above 20 per cent direct an unconditional distribution of the land proceed i be therefore subject a second time in the period of a few day to the necessity of either give my approval to a measure which in my deliberate judgment be in conflict with great public interest or of return it to the house in which it originate with my objection with all my anxiety for the passage of a law which would replenish an exhausted treasury and furnish a sound and healthy encouragement to mechanical industry i can not consent to do so at the sacrifice of the peace and harmony of the country and the clear conviction of public duty
 for some of the reason which have bring i to this conclusion i refer to my previous message to congress and briefly subjoin the follow
 1 the bill unite two subject which so far from have any affinity to one another be wholly incongruous in their character it be both a revenue and an appropriation bill it thus impose on the executive in the first place the necessity of either approve that which he would reject or reject that which he might otherwise approve this be a species of constraint to which the judgment of the executive ought not in my opinion to be subject but that be not my only objection to the act in its present form the union of subject wholly dissimilar in their character in the same bill if it grow into a practice would not fail to lead to consequence destructive of all wise and conscientious legislation various measure each agreeable only to a small minority might by be thus united and the more the great chance of success lead to the passing of law of which no single provision could if stand alone command a majority in its favor
 2 while the treasury be in a state of extreme embarrassment require every dollar which it can make available and when the government have not only to lay additional taxis but to borrow money to meet press demand the bill propose to give away a fruitful source of revenue which be the same thing as raise money by loan and taxation not to meet the want of the government but for distribution a proceeding which i must regard as highly impolitic if not unconstitutional
 a brief review of the present condition of the public finance will serve to illustrate the true condition of the treasury and exhibit its actual necessity
 on the 5th of august friday last there be in the
 treasury in round numbers------------------------------------------------------ $ 2,150,000
 necessary to be retain to meet trust fund $ 360,000
 interest on public debt due in october----------------------------------------------- 80,000
 to redeem treasury note and pay the interest-------------------------------------- 100,000
 land distribution under the act of the 4th of september 1841 640,000
 1,180,000
 leave an available amount of----------------------------------------------- 970,000
 the navy department have draw requisition on the treasury at that time to meet debt actually due among which be bill under protest for 1,414,000 thus leave an actual deficit of $ 444,000
 there be on hand about $ 100,000 of unissued treasury note assist by the accruing revenue amount to about $ 150,000 per week exclusive of receipt on unpaid bond to meet requisition for the army and the demand of the civil list
 the withdrawal of the sum of $ 640,000 to be distribute among the states so soon as the statement and account can be make up and complete by virtue of the provision of the act of the 4th of september last of which nearly a moiety go to a few state and only about $ 383,000 be to be divide among all the states while it add materially to the embarrassment of the treasury afford to the states no decide relief
 no immediate relief from this state of thing be anticipate unless what would most deeply be deplore the government could be reconcile to the negotiation of loan already authorize by law at a rate of discount ruinous in itself and calculate most seriously to affect the public credit so great be the depression of trade that even if the present bill be to become a law and prove to be productive some time would elapse before sufficient supply would flow into the treasury while in the meantime its embarrassment would be continually augment by the semiannual distribution of the land proceed
 indeed there be but too much ground to apprehend that even if this bill be permit to become a law alienate as it do the proceed of the land sale an actual deficit in the treasury would occur which would more than probably involve the necessity of a resort to direct taxation
 let it be also remark that $ 5,500,000 of the public debt become redeemable in about two year and a half which at any sacrifice must be meet while the treasury be always liable to demand for the payment of outstanding treasury note such be the gloomy picture which our financial department now present and which call for the exercise of a rigid economy in the public expenditure and the rendering available of all the mean within the control of the government i most respectfully submit whether this be a time to give away the proceed of the land sale when the public land constitute a fund which of all other may be make most useful in sustain the public credit can the government be generous and munificent to other when every dollar it can command be necessary to supply its own want and if congress would not hesitate to suffer the provision of the act of 4th september last to remain unrepealed in case the country be involve in war be not the necessity for such a course now just as imperative as it would be then
 3 a third objection remain to be urge which would be sufficient in itself to induce i to return the bill to the house with my objection by unite two subject so incongruous as tariff and distribution it inevitably make the fate of the one dependent upon that of the other in future contest of party can anything be more fatal to the merchant or manufacturer than such an alliance what they most of all require be a system of moderate duty so arrange as to withdraw the tariff question as far as possible completely from the arena of political contention their chief want be permanency and stability such an increase of the tariff i believe to be necessary in order to meet the economical expenditure of government such an increase make in the spirit of moderation and judicious discrimination would i have no doubt be entirely satisfactory to the great majority of the american people in the way of accomplish a measure so salutary and so imperatively demand by every public interest the legislative department will meet with a cordial cooperation on the part of the executive this be all that the manufacturer can desire and it would be a burden readily bear by the people but i can not too earnestly repeat that in order to be beneficial it must be permanent and in order to be permanent it must command general acquiescence but can such permanency be justly hope for if the tariff question be couple with that of distribution as to which a serious conflict of opinion exist among the states and the people and which enlist in its support a bare majority if indeed there be a majority of the two houses of congress what permanency or stability can attach to a measure which war upon itself give away a fruitful source of revenue at the moment it propose a large increase of taxis on the people be the manufacturer prepare to stake himself and his interest upon such an issue
 i know that it be urge but most erroneously in my opinion that instability be just as apt to be produce by retain the public land as a source of revenue as from any other cause and this be ascribe to a constant fluctuation as it be say in the amount of sale if there be anything in this objection it equally apply to every imposition of duty on import the amount of revenue annually derive from duty be constantly liable to change the regulation of foreign government the vary productiveness of other country period of excitement in trade and a great variety of other circumstance be constantly arise to affect the state of commerce foreign and domestic and of consequence the revenue levy upon it the sale of the public domain in ordinary time be regulate by fix law which have their basis in a demand increase only in the ratio of the increase of population in recur to the statistic connect with this subject it will be perceive that for a period of ten year precede 1834 the average amount of land sale do not exceed $ 2,000,000 for the increase which take place in 1834 1835 and 1836 we be to look to that peculiar condition of the country which grow out of one of the most extraordinary excitement in business and speculation that have ever occur in the history of commerce and currency it be the fruit of a wild spirit of adventure engender by a vicious system of credit under the evil of which the country be still labor and which it be fondly hope will not soon recur consider the vast amount of investment make by private individual in the public land during those three year and which equal $ 43,000,000 equal to more than twenty years&#39 purchase take the average of sale of the ten precede year it may be safely assert that the result of the public land sale can hold out nothing to alarm the manufacturer with the idea of instability in the revenue and consequently in the course of the government
 under what appear to i therefore the sound consideration of public policy and in view of the interest of every branch of domestic industry i return you the bill with these my objection to its become a law
 i take occasion emphatically to repeat my anxious desire to cooperate with congress in the passing of a law which while it shall assist in supply the want of the treasury and reestablish public credit shall afford to the manufacture interest of the country all the incidental protection they require
 after all the effect of what i do be substantially to call on congress to reconsider the subject if on such reconsideration a majority of two third of both houses should be in favor of this measure it will become a law notwithstanding my objection in a case of clear and manifest error on the part of the president the presumption of the constitution be that such majority will be find should they be so find in this case having conscientiously discharge my own duty i shall cheerfully acquiesce in the result

to the senate of the united states
 i have the satisfaction to communicate to the senate the result of the negotiation recently have in this city with the british minister special and extraordinary
 these result comprise--
 first a treaty to settle and define the boundary between the territory of the united states and the possession of her britannic majesty in north america for the suppression of the african slave trade and the surrender of criminal fugitive from justice in certain case
 second a correspondence on the subject of the interference of the colonial authority of the british west indies with american merchant vessel drive by stress of weather or carry by violence into the port of those colony
 third a correspondence upon the subject of the attack and destruction of the steamboat caroline
 fourth a correspondence on the subject of impressment
 if this treaty shall receive the approbation of the senate it will terminate a difference respect boundary which have long subsist between the two government have be the subject of several ineffectual attempt at settlement and have sometimes lead to great irritation not without danger of disturb the exist peace both the united states and the states more immediately concerned have entertain no doubt of the validity of the american title to all the territory which have be in dispute but that title be controvert and the government of the united states have agree to make the dispute a subject of arbitration one arbitration have be actually have but have fail to settle the controversy and it be find at the commencement of last year that a correspondence have be in progress between the two government for a joint commission with an ultimate reference to an umpire or arbitrator with authority to make a final decision that correspondence however have be retard by various occurrence and have come to no definite result when the special mission of lord ashburton be announce this movement on the part of england afford in the judgment of the executive a favorable opportunity for make an attempt to settle this long exist controversy by some agreement or treaty without further reference to arbitration
 it seem entirely proper that if this purpose be entertain consultation should be have with the authority of the states of maine and massachusetts letter therefore of which copy be herewith communicate be address to the governor of those states suggest that commissioner should be appoint by each of they respectively to repair to this city and confer with the authority of this government on a line by agreement or compromise with its equivalent and compensation this suggestion be meet by both states in a spirit of candor and patriotism and promptly comply with four commissioner on the part of maine and three on the part of massachusetts all person of distinction and high character be duly appoint and commission and lose no time in present themselves at the seat of the government of the united states these commissioner have be in correspondence with this government during the period of the discussion have enjoy its confidence and free communication have aid the general object with their counsel and advice and in the end have unanimously signify their assent to the line propose in the treaty
 ordinarily it would be no easy task to reconcile and bring together such a variety of interest in a matter in itself difficult and perplexed but the effort of the government in attempt to accomplish this desirable object have be second and sustain by a spirit of accommodation and conciliation on the part of the states concern to which much of the success of these effort be to be ascribe
 connect with the settlement of the line of the northeastern boundary so far as it respect the states of maine and massachusetts be the continuation of that line along the highland to the northwesternmost head of connecticut river which of the source of that stream be entitle to this character have be matter of controversy and of some interest to the state of new hampshire the king of the netherlands decide the main branch to be the northwesternmost head of the connecticut this do not satisfy the claim of new hampshire the line agree to in the present treaty follow the highland to the head of halls stream and thence down that river embrace the whole claim of new hampshire and establish her title to 100,000 acre of territory more than she would have have by the decision of the king of the netherlands
 by the treaty of 1783 the line be to proceed down the connecticut river to the forty fifth degree of north latitude and thence west by that parallel till it strike the st. lawrence recent examination having ascertain that the line heretofore receive as the true line of latitude between those point be erroneous and that the correction of this error would not only leave on the british side a considerable tract of territory heretofore suppose to belong to the states of vermont and new york but also rouses point the site of a military work of the united states it have be regard as an object of importance not only to establish the right and jurisdiction of those state up to the line to which they have be consider to extend but also to comprehend rouses point within the territory of the united states the relinquishment by the british government of all the territory south of the line heretofore consider to be the true line have be obtain and the consideration for this relinquishment be to inure by the provision of the treaty to the states of maine and massachusetts
 the line of boundary then from the source of the st. croix to the st. lawrence so far as maine and massachusetts be concern be fix by their own consent and for consideration satisfactory to they the chief of these consideration be the privilege of transport the lumber and agricultural product grow and raise in maine on the water of the st. johns and its tributary down that river to the ocean free from imposition or disability the importance of this privilege perpetual in its term to a country cover at present by pine forest of great value and much of it capable hereafter of agricultural improvement be not a matter upon which the opinion of intelligent man be likely to be divide
 so far as new hampshire be concern the treaty secure all that she require and new york and vermont be quiet to the extent of their claim and occupation the difference which would be make in the northern boundary of these two states by correct the parallel of latitude may be see on tanner 's map 1836 new atla map nos 6 and 9
 from the intersection of the forty fifth degree of north latitude with the st. lawrence and along that river and the lake to the water communication between lake huron and lake superior the line be definitively agree on by the commissioner of the two government under the sixth article of the treaty of ghent but between this last mention point and the lake of the woods the commissioner act under the seventh article of that treaty find several matter of disagreement and therefore make no joint report to their respective government the first of these be sugar island or st. georges island lie in st. marys river or the water communication between lakes huron and superior by the present treaty this island be embrace in the territory of the united states both from soil and position it be regard as of much value
 another matter of difference be the manner of extend the line from the point at which the commissioner arrive north of isle royale in lake superior to the lake of the woods the british commissioner insist on proceed to fond du lac at the southw angle of the lake and thence by the river st. louis to the rainy lake the american commissioner suppose the true course to be to proceed by way of the dog river attempt be make to compromise this difference but without success the detail of these proceeding be find at length in the print separate report of the commissioner
 from the imperfect knowledge of this remote country at the date of the treaty of peace some of the description in that treaty do not harmonize with its natural feature as now ascertain long lake be nowhere to be find under that name there be reason for supposing however that the sheet of water intend by that name be the estuary at the mouth of pigeon river the present treaty therefore adopt that estuary and river and afterwards pursue the usual route across the height of land by the various portage and small lake till the line reach rainy lake from which the commissioner agree on the extension of it to its termination in the northw angle of the lake of the woods the region of country on and near the shore of the lake between pigeon river on the north and fond du lac and the river st. louis on the south and west consider valuable as a mineral region be thus include within the united states it embrace a territory of 4,000,000 acre northward of the claim set up by the british commissioner under the treaty of ghent from the height of land at the head of pigeon river westerly to the rainy lake the country be understand to be of little value be describe by surveyor and mark on the map as a region of rock and water
 from the northw angle of the lake of the woods which be find to be in latitude 45пїѕ 23 55 north exist treaty require the line to be run due south to its intersection with the forty fifth parallel and thence along that parallel to the rocky mountains
 after sundry informal communication with the british minister upon the subject of the claim of the two country to territory west of the rocky mountains so little probability be find to exist of come to any agreement on that subject at present that it be not think expedient to make it one of the subject of formal negotiation to be enter upon between this government and the british minister as part of his duty under his special mission
 by the treaty of 1783 the line of division along the river and lake from the place where the forty fifth parallel of north latitude strike the st. lawrence to the outlet of lake superior be invariably to be draw through the middle of such water and not through the middle of their main channel such a line if extend accord to the literal term of the treaty would it be obvious occasionally intersect island the manner in which the commissioner of the two government deal with this difficult subject may be see in their report but where the line thus follow the middle of the river or water course do not meet with island yet it be liable sometimes to leave the only practicable navigable channel altogether on one side the treaty make no provision for the common use of the water by the citizen and subject of both country
 it have happen therefore in a few instance that the use of the river in particular place would be greatly diminish to one party or the other if in fact there be not a choice in the use of channel and passage thus at the long sault in the st. lawrence a dangerous passage practicable only for boat the only safe run be between the long sault islands and barnharts island all which belong to the united states on one side and the american shore on the other on the other hand by far the good passage for vessel of any depth of water from lake erie into the detroit river be between bois blanc a british island and the canadian shore so again there be several channel or passage of different degree of facility and usefulness between the several island in the river st. clair at or near its entry into the lake of that name in these three case the treaty provide that all the several passage and channel shall be free and open to the use of the citizen and subject of both party
 the treaty obligation subsist between the two country for the suppression of the african slave trade and the complaint make to this government within the last three or four year many of they but too well found of the visitation seizure and detention of american vessel on that coast by british cruiser could not but form a delicate and highly important part of the negotiation which have now be hold
 the early and prominent part which the government of the united states have take for the abolition of this unlawful and inhuman traffic be well know by the tenth article of the treaty of ghent it be declare that the traffic in slave be irreconcilable with the principle of humanity and justice and that both his majesty and the united states be desirous of continue their effort to promote its entire abolition and it be thereby agree that both the contracting party shall use their good endeavor to accomplish so desirable an object the government of the united states have by law declare the african slave trade piracy and at its suggestion other nation have make similar enactment it have not be want in honest and zealous effort make in conformity with the wish of the whole country to accomplish the entire abolition of the traffic in slave upon the african coast but these effort and those of other country direct to the same end have prove to a considerable degree unsuccessful treaty be know to have be enter into some year ago between england and france by which the former power which usually maintain a large naval force on the african station be authorize to seize and bring in for adjudication vessel find engage in the slave trade under the french flag
 it be know that in december last a treaty be sign in london by the representative of england france russia prussia and austria have for its profess object a strong and united effort of the five power to put an end to the traffic this treaty be not officially communicate to the government of the united states but its provision and stipulation be suppose to be accurately know to the public it be understand to be not yet ratify on the part of france
 no application or request have be make to this government to become party to this treaty but the course it might take in regard to it have exalt no small degree of attention and discussion in europe as the principle upon which it be found and the stipulation which it contain have cause warm animadversion and great political excitement
 in my message at the commencement of the present session of congress i endeavor to state the principle which this government support respect the right of search and the immunity of flag desirous of maintain those principle fully at the same time that exist obligation should be fulfil i have think it most consistent with the honor and dignity of the country that it should execute its own law and perform its own obligation by its own mean and its own power
 the examination or visitation of the merchant vessel of one nation by the cruiser of another for any purpose except those know and acknowledge by the law of nation under whatever restraint or regulation it may take place may lead to dangerous result it be far well by other mean to supersede any suppose necessity or any motive for such examination or visit interference with a merchant vessel by an armed cruiser be always a delicate proceeding apt to touch the point of national honor as well as to affect the interest of individual it have be think therefore expedient not only in accordance with the stipulation of the treaty of ghent but at the same time as remove all pretext on the part of other for violate the immunity of the american flag upon the sea as they exist and be define by the law of nation to enter into the article now submit to the senate
 the treaty which i now submit to you propose no alteration mitigation or modification of the rule of the law of nation it provide simply that each of the two government shall maintain on the coast of africa a sufficient squadron to enforce separately and respectively the law right and obligation of the two country for the suppression of the slave trade
 another consideration of great importance have recommend this mode of fulfil the duty and obligation of the country our commerce along the western coast of africa be extensive and suppose to be increase there be reason to think that in many case those engage in it have meet with interruption and annoyance cause by the jealousy and instigation of rival engage in the same trade many complaint on this subject have reach the government a respectable naval force on the coast be the natural resort and security against further occurrence of this kind
 the surrender to justice of person who having commit high crime seek an asylum in the territory of a neighboring nation would seem to be an act due to the cause of general justice and properly belong to the present state of civilization and intercourse the british provinces of north america be separate from the states of the union by a line of several thousand mile and along portion of this line the amount of population on either side be quite considerable while the passage of the boundary be always easy
 offender against the law on the one side transfer themselves to the other sometimes with great difficulty they be bring to justice but very often they wholly escape a consciousness of immunity from the power of avoid justice in this way instigate the unprincipled and reckless to the commission of offense and the peace and good neighborhood of the border be consequently often disturb
 in the case of offender flee from canada into the united states the governor of states be often apply to for their surrender and question of a very embarrassing nature arise from these application it have be think highly important therefore to provide for the whole case by a proper treaty stipulation the article on the subject in the propose treaty be carefully confine to such offense as all mankind agree to regard as heinous and destructive of the security of life and property in this careful and specific enumeration of crime the object have be to exclude all political offense or criminal charge arise from war or intestine commotion treason misprision of treason libel desertion from military service and other offense of similar character be exclude
 and lest some unforeseen inconvenience or unexpected abuse should arise from the stipulation render its continuance in the opinion of one or both of the party not long desirable it be leave in the power of either to put an end to it at will
 the destruction of the steamboat caroline at schlosser four or five year ago occasion no small degree of excitement at the time and become the subject of correspondence between the two government that correspondence having be suspend for a considerable period be renew in the spring of the last year but no satisfactory result having be arrive at it be think proper though the occurrence have cease to be fresh and recent not to omit attention to it on the present occasion it have only be so far discuss in the correspondence now submit as it be accomplish by a violation of the territory of the united states the letter of the british minister while he attempt to justify that violation upon the ground of a pressing and overruling necessity admit nevertheless that even if justifiable an apology be due for it and accompany this acknowledgment with assurance of the sacred regard of his government for the inviolability of national territory have seem to i sufficient to warrant forbearance from any further remonstrance against what take place as an aggression on the soil and territory of the country on the subject of the interference of the british authority in the west indies a confident hope be entertain that the correspondence which have take place show the ground take by this government and the engagement enter into by the british minister will be find such as to satisfy the just expectation of the people of the united states
 the impressment of seaman from merchant vessel of this country by british cruiser although not practice in time of peace and therefore not at present a productive cause of difference and irritation have nevertheless hitherto be so prominent a topic of controversy and be so likely to bring on renew contention at the first breaking out of a european war that it have be think the part of wisdom now to take it into serious and earnest consideration the letter from the secretary of state to the british minister explain the ground which the government have assume and the principle which it mean to uphold for the defense of these ground and the maintenance of these principle the most perfect reliance be place on the intelligence of the american people and on their firmness and patriotism in whatever touch the honor of the country or its great and essential interest

 accordingly they do meet at that place and begin their operation
 it may be desirable to state at the outset that for the sake of convenience the whole line of boundary mark by the undersigned have be divide in the mention make of the different portion into the follow grand division viz
 north line from the source of the st. croix to the intersection of the st. john
 river st. john from the intersection of the north line to the mouth of the st. francis
 river st. francis from its mouth to the outlet of lake pohenagamook
 southwest line from the outlet of lake pohenagamook to the northwest branch of the st. john
 south line from the northwest branch to the parallel of latitude 46 degree 25 on the southwest branch
 southwest branch from the parallel 46пїѕ 25 to its source
 highlands from the source of the southwest branch of the st. john to the source of halls stream
 halls streams from its source to the intersection of the line of valentine and collins
 west line from halls stream to the st. lawrence near st. regis along the line of valentine and collins
 to return to the narration of operation
 the explore line of colonel bouchette and mr. johnson as direct by the treaty be trace from the monument at the source of the st. croix to the intersection of the st. john
 the monument find at the source of the st. croix as describe in the report of colonel bouchette and mr. johnson and the course of their explore line be trace by blaze or mark upon the tree
 an old line cut out by the assistant surveyor of colonel bouchette and mr. johnson be also find which terminate about half a mile north of the south branch of the meduxnikeag where by record to which the undersigned refer they ascertain that it have be abandon because of its deviation from the explore fine of colonel bouchette and mr. johnson
 after the exploration and remarking of the north line it be cut out 30 foot wide the same be afterwards do in all part where the boundary pass through woodland after thus open the north line it be survey and iron post be erect at interval to mark it
 the general bearing of the line be rather to the west of the meridian of the monument at the source of the st. croix the precise line lay down by the undersigned be determine by successive course of which each be make to be as long as be convenient provide it do not pass out of the opening of 30 foot
 at each angle of deflection an iron monument be erect and place anglewise with the line other monument be erect at the crossing of road river and at every mile commence from the source of the st. croix those which be not intend to mark angle of deflection be place square with the line
 at the intersection of the st. john by the north line the river be deep and broad the boundary rim up the middle of the channel of the river as indicate by the map divide the island as follow
 no 1 ryan 's island------------------------------------------------------------------ united states
 no 2 king 's island------------------------------------------------------------------ united states
 no 3 les trois isles----------------------------------------------------------------- united states

 no 18 savage and johnson 's island------------------------------------------------ united states
 no 19 grew 's island---------------------------------------------------------------- united states
 no 20 kendall 's island------------------------------------------------------------- great britain
 the island be distribute to great britain or to the united states as they be find to be on the fight or left of the deep channel there be but one doubtful case la septieme isle and that be apportion to the united states because the majority of the owner be ascertain to reside on the united states side of the river
 monument be erect upon the island mark they for great britain or the united states as the case may have be
 after leave the st. john the boundary enter the st. francis divide the island at the mouth of that river in the manner show in the map it then run up the st. francis through the middle of the lake upon it to the outlet of lake pohenagamook the third large lake from the mouth of the river at the outlet a large monument have be erect
 in order to determine the point on the northwest branch to which the treaty direct that a straight line should be run from the outlet of lake pohenagamook a survey of that stream be make and also of the main st. john in the neighborhood of the mouth of the northwest branch and a line be cut between the john and the point on the northwest branch ascertain by the survey to be mile in the near direction from it and the distance be afterwards verify by chain
 it be ascertain also in accordance with the provision of the treaty by a triangulation of the country toward the highland divide the water of the st. lawrence and of the st. john that more than 7 mile intervene between the point select on the northwest branch and the crest of the dividing ridge a large iron monument be afterwards erect on the point thus select and the space around be clear and sow with grass seed it be a short distance below the outlet of lake ishaganalshegeck
 the outlet of lake pohenagamook and the point on the northwest branch designate by the treaty having be thus ascertain and mark in the spring of 1844 a straight line be run between they along that line which pass entirely through forest monument be erect at every mile at the crossing of the principal stream and river and at the top of those hill where a transit instrument have be set up to test the straightness of the line
 as soon as the parallel of latitude 46пїѕ 25 have be determine on the southwest branch in the early part of the summer of 1844 a straight line be draw from the boundary point on the northwest branch to a large monument erect on the left bank of the southwest branch where it be intersect by the parallel of latitude 46пїѕ 25 the line so draw crosse the southwest branch once before it reach the parallel of latitude 46 degree 25 and at about half a mile distance from that parallel there also a large monument have be set up on the left bank
 from the intersection of the parallel 46пїѕ 25 the boundary ascend the southwest branch pass through a lake near its head and so up a small stream which fall into the lake from the west to the source of that stream which have be select as the source of the southwest branch
 on the southwest branch there be two principal fork at each of which two monument have be erect one on each bank of the river immediately above the fork and upon the branch establish as the boundary the map point out their position at the mouth of the small stream select as the source of the southwest branch a monument have be erect upon a delta form by two small outlet above those outlet three other monument have be place at interval upon the same stream
 upon the crest of the dividing ridge very close to the source of the southwest branch a large monument have be erect it be the first point in the highland and from it the boundary run along the crest in a southerly direction pass near to the southeastern shore of the portage lake and so on to a large monument erect on a small eminence on the east side of the kennebec road thence it pass through a dwelling house call tachereau 's which be stand there at the time the line be run so by a tortuous course it run to the top of sandy stream mountain thence incline to the southwest it run over hog back the first as show in the map thence toward hog back the second which it leave on the north side far on at the head of leech lake there be a stream which divide its water and flow both into canada and into the united states the boundary have be make to run up that stream a short distance from the fork where the water divide to a second fork thence between the stream which unite to form that fork and then to ascend again the dividing ridge a monument have be erect at the fork first mention where the water divide
 as the boundary approach the valley of spider river it bend to the southeast and by a wide circuit over high and steep hill it turn the head of spider river thence it bend to the northwest until it approach within about 4 mile of lake megantic thence it turn again south have the valley of arnolds river on the right and of dead river on the left it leave gasford mountain in canada thread its way over very high ground between the head of arnolds river and the tributary of the magalloway incline then to the north so to the west over very rocky mountainous and difficult country leave gipps peak in the united states and turn by a sharp angle at saddle back to the south after that it again incline to the west and then to the south and again to the west and pass the head of the connecticut about 3 mile and a half east of the head of the connecticut there be a division of water similar to that describe near leech lake the boundary run down a stream from near its source to the fork where it divide and then again follow the dividing ridge the spot be note on the map
 after the boundary have pass the head of the connecticut it run to the northwest descend into very low swampy ground between the head of indian stream and the tributary of the st. francis thus it pass on bend again to the south of west over a high hill to the source of halls stream
 iron monument have be erect at interval along the highland from the source of the southwest branch of the st. john to the source of halls stream the position of each of which be show upon the map
 from the source of halls stream the boundary descend that river divide the island which be however merely unimportant alluvial deposit in the manner indicate by the map until it reach the intersection of that stream by the line formerly run by valentine and collins as the forty fifth degree of north latitude
 at that point a large monument have be erect on the right and a small one on the left bank of the stream monument have also be erect along the bank of this stream as indicate on the map
 the line of valentine and collins be explore and find by the blaze still remain in the original forest
 upon cut into those blaze it be see that deep seat in the tree there be a scar the surface of the original blaze slightly decay and upon count the ring which indicate each year 's growth of the tree it be find that the blaze date back to 1772 1773 and 1774 the line of valentine and collins be run in 1771 1772 1773 and 1774 the coincidence of the date of the blaze with those of the above line confirm by the testimony of the people of the country satisfy the undersigned that the line they have find be that mention in the treaty along this portion of the boundary which be know as the forty fifth degree of valentine and collins and which extend from halls stream to st. regis there be several interruption to the blaze in those part where clearing have be make and there the authentic mark of the precise situation of the old line have be lose in those case the undersigned have draw the boundary line straight from the original blaze on the one side of a clearing to the original blaze on the other side of the same clearing
 it can not be positively state that the line as it have be trace through those clearing precisely coincide with the old line but the undersigned believe that it do not differ materially from it nor have they have the mean of determine a nearer or a surer approximation
 along this line at every point of deflection an iron monument have be erect also at the crossing of river lake and road those which mark deflection be place as on the north line anglewise with the line all the other be place square with it the map show the position of each
 on the eastern shore of lake memphremagog an astronomical station be establish and on a large flat rock of granite which happen to lie between the astronomical station and the boundary be cut the following inscription
 capt robinson
 ast station
 422 foot north
 british boundary meridian line commission
 boundary line
 595 foot south
 august 1845
 a mark be cut upon the stone as indicate by the dot upon the meridian line above from which these measurement be make
 at rouses point a monument of wrought stone be set up at the intersection of the boundary by the meridian of the transit instrument use there by major graham and an inscription be cut upon it state the latitude and longitude the name of the observer and his assistant the name of the commissioner and the territory divide
 to mark the position of the instrument use at the follow astronomical station along the west line two monument within a few foot of each other have be erect at each station and they have be place on the boundary line due north or south of the instrument as the case may have be
 the station be lake memphremagog richford john mccoy 's trout river
 the boundary along the west line though very far from be a straight line be generally about half a mile north of the true parallel of latitude 45пїѕ from halls stream to rouses point at about 28 mile west of rouses point it however crosse that parallel to the south until it reach chateaugay river where it bend northward and cross the parallel again about 4 mile east of st. regis it strike the st. lawrence 151 foot north of 45пїѕ. at that point a large monument have be erect on the bank of the st. lawrence two large monument have also be erect one on either side of the river richelieu near rouses point
 no mark of the old line be to be find about st. regis it be therefore agree to run a line due west from the last blaze which should be find in the wood on the east side of st. regis that blaze occur about 1 mile east of the st. regis river
 the map which exhibit the boundary on a scale of 4 inch to 1 statute mile consist of 62 consecutive sheet of antiquarian paper as construct by the british and of 61 as construct by the american commission a general map have also be construct on a scale of 8 mile to 1 inch by the british and of 10 mile to 1 inch by the american commission upon which the before mention sheet be represent
 the following portion of the boundary have be lay down by the british commission on detach map on a scale of 12 inch to 1 mile which have be sign by both commissioner
 grand falls of the st. john include the intersection of that river by the north line island of the st. john the outlet of lake pohenagamook the turning point of the boundary on the northwest branch of the st. john the intersection of the southwest branch by the parallel of latitude 46 degree 25 the source of the southwest branch the source of halls stream the intersection of halls stream by the west line rouses point st. regis derby
 but similar map have not be prepare by the american commission because during the interval between the finishing of the map of the british commission and those of the american it be think that the map already construct upon a scale of 4 inch to 1 mile represent the boundary with sufficient clearness and accuracy
 the astronomical observation be begin at the grand falls early in june 1843 and be carry up the st. john river to the northwest branch by a chain of station which together with the result obtain be tabulate in the appendix accompany this report
 from the valley of the st. john an astronomical connection be make with quebec and thence to montreal and so to rouses point from rouses point a connection be obtain with cambridge university near boston
 the astronomical station on the west line be intersection of halls stream by the west line lake memphremagog richford rouses point john mccoy 's trout river st. regis
 latitude be also obtain at an astronomical station establish for the purpose at the head of the connecticut
 volume contain the astronomical observation of both commission be herewith submit from they it will be observe that the result for absolute longitude obtain by the british and american astronomer do not agree it be a difference in no way affect the survey of the boundary line the undersigned do not feel call upon to attempt to reconcile it the datum upon which those result be base may be see in the volume of observation accompany this report
 in the appendix will be find in a tabular form the follow
 an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the north line an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the southwest line an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the south line an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the highland an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the west line the position of the monument erect on the southwest branch of the st. john and on halls stream the distribution of the island of the st. john and the monument on they the guide line and offset run by each commission for the survey of the highland the azimuth of verification for the survey of the highland the latitude and longitude obtain from the astronomical observation the comparative 1ongitudes obtain and the method use for the purpose
 upon compare the map of the two commission it will be see that the american commission number two monument more than the british those be to be find one on the fourth island in the river st. john and the other on the highland between the source of the southwest branch of the river st. john and the kennebec road
 on the map of the british commission represent the west line the name of the town of derby have be improperly place north of the line instead of south of it also on the same map the direction of salmon river near the western extremity of the west line have be incorrectly lay down from the boundary line northward a direction have be give to it northeasterly instead of northwesterly
 the above two correction the british commissioner be authorize to make on his map after his return to england
 to avoid unnecessary delay in make their joint report the undersigned have attach their signature to the map although the lettering of some of the astronomical station upon the map of the american commission as well as the alteration before mention in the map of the british commission be yet to be make but in the map of both the boundary have be lay down accurately and definitively and the undersigned engage that it shall not be alter in any respect
 in conclusion the undersigned have the honor to report that the line of boundary describe in the forego statement have be run mark and survey and the accompany map faithfully construct from that survey
 the undersigned take leave to add that the most perfect harmony have subsist between the two commission from first to last and that no difference have arise between the undersigned in the execution of the duty intrust to they

to the senate of the united states
 i transmit to the senate for its consideration with a view to its ratification a treaty of amity commerce and navigation with the republic of texas negotiate at the seat of government of the united states between the secretary of state duly empower for that purpose and the charge&#39 d&#39;affaire of that republic
 in form the first commercial treaty between the two government an anxious desire have be feel to introduce such provision as should promote the interest of both country the immediate proximity of texas to the united states and the consequent facility of intercourse the nature of its principal agricultural production and the relation which both country bear to several large river which be boundary between they and which in some part of their course run within the territory of both have cause peculiarity of condition and interest which it have be necessary to guard
 the treaty provide that texas shall enjoy a right of deposit for such of her production as may be introduce into the united states for exportation but upon the condition that the executive of the united states may prescribe such regulation as may be necessary for the proper enjoyment of the privilege within our territory it be think no more than reasonable to grant this facility to the trade of texas under such condition as seem well calculate to guard against abuse or inconvenience
 the treaty far provide that raw cotton may be import from either country into the other free of duty in general it be not wise to enter into treaty stipulation respect duty of import they be usually much well leave to the operation of general law but there be circumstance exist in this case which have be think to justify a departure from the general rule and the addition of it to the number of instance not large in which regulation of duty of import have be make the subject of national compact
 the united states consume large quantity of raw cotton but they be exporter of the article to a still great extent texas for the present at least export her whole crop these exportation be in general to the same foreign market and it be suppose to be of no considerable importance to the american producer whether he meet the texan product at home or abroad
 on the other hand it be think that a useful commercial intercourse would be promote in several way by receive the raw cotton of texas at once into the united states free of duty the tendency of such a measure be to bring to the united states in the first instance texan cotton ultimately destine to european market the natural effect of this it be suppose will be to increase the business of the city of the united states to the extent of this importation and exportation and to secure a further degree of employment to the navigation of the country but these be by no means all the benefit which may be reasonably expect from the arrangement texas at least for a considerable time to come must import all the manufacture article and much of the supply and provision necessary for her use and consumption these commodity she will be likely to obtain if to be have in the market of the country in which she dispose of her main annual product the manufacture of the north and east therefore and the grain and provision of the western states be likely to find in texas a demand increase by whatever augment intercourse between the two country and especially by whatever tend to give attraction to the city of the united states as mart for the sale of her great and principal article of export
 as a security however against unforeseen result or occurrence it have be think advisable to give this article of the treaty a limitation of five year

to the senate and house of representatives of the united states
 we have continue reason to express our profound gratitude to the great creator of all thing for numberless benefit confer upon we as a people bless with genial season the husbandman have his garner fill with abundance and the necessary of life not to speak of its luxury abound in every direction while in some other nation steady and industrious labor can hardly find the mean of subsistence the great evil which we have to encounter be a surplus of production beyond the home demand which seek and with difficulty find a partial market in other region the health of the country with partial exception have for the past year be well preserve and under their free and wise institution the united states be rapidly advance toward the consummation of the high destiny which an overrule providence seem to have mark out for they exempt from domestic convulsion and at peace with all the world we be leave free to consult as to the good mean of secure and advance the happiness of the people such be the circumstance under which you now assemble in your respective chamber and which should lead we to unite in praise and thanksgive to that great being who make we and who preserve we as a nation
 i congratulate you fellow citizen on the happy change in the aspect of our foreign affair since my last annual message cause of complaint at that time exist between the united states and great britain which attend by irritate circumstance threaten most seriously the public peace the difficulty of adjust amicably the question at issue between the two country be in no small degree augment by the lapse of time since they have their origin the opinion entertain by the executive on several of the lead topic in dispute be frankly set forth in the message at the opening of your late session the appointment of a special minister by great britain to the united states with power to negotiate upon most of the point of difference indicate a desire on her part amicably to adjust they and that minister be meet by the executive in the same spirit which have dictate his mission the treaty consequent thereon having be duly ratify by the two government a copy together with the correspondence which accompany it be herewith communicate i trust that whilst you may see in it nothing objectionable it may be the mean of preserve for an indefinite period the amicable relation happily exist between the two government the question of peace or war between the united states and great britain be a question of the deep interest not only to themselves but to the civilized world since it be scarcely possible that a war could exist between they without endanger the peace of christendom the immediate effect of the treaty upon ourselves will be feel in the security afford to mercantile enterprise which no long apprehensive of interruption adventure its speculation in the most distant sea and freight with the diversified production of every land return to bless our own there be nothing in the treaty which in the slight degree compromit the honor or dignity of either nation next to the settlement of the boundary line which must always be a matter of difficulty between state as between individual the question which seem to threaten the great embarrassment be that connect with the african slave trade
 by the tenth article of the treaty of ghent it be expressly declare that--
 whereas the traffic in slave be irreconcilable with the principle of humanity and justice and whereas both his majesty and the united states be desirous of continue their effort to promote its entire abolition it be hereby agree that both the contracting party shall use their good endeavor to accomplish so desirable an object
 in the enforcement of the law and treaty stipulation of great britain a practice have threaten to grow up on the part of its cruiser of subject to visitation ship sail under the american flag which while it seriously involve our maritime right would subject to vexation a branch of our trade which be daily increase and which require the foster care of government and although lord aberdeen in his correspondence with the american envoy at london expressly disclaim all right to detain an american ship on the high sea even if find with a cargo of slave on board and restrict the british pretension to a mere claim to visit and inquire yet it could not well be discern by the executive of the united states how such visit and inquiry could be make without detention on the voyage and consequent interruption to the trade it be regard as the right of search present only in a new form and express in different word and i therefore feel it to be my duty distinctly to declare in my annual message to congress that no such concession could be make and that the united states have both the will and the ability to enforce their own law and to protect their flag from be use for purpose wholly forbid by those law and obnoxious to the moral censure of the world take the message as his letter of instruction our then minister at paris feel himself require to assume the same ground in a remonstrance which he feel it to be his duty to present to mr. guizot and through he to the king of the french against what have be call the quintuple treaty and his conduct in this respect meet with the approval of this government in close conformity with these view the eighth article of the treaty be frame which provide that each nation shall keep afloat in the african sea a force not less than 80 gun to act separately and apart under instruction from their respective government and for the enforcement of their respective law and obligation from this it will be see that the ground assume in the message have be fully maintain at the same time that the stipulation of the treaty of ghent be to be carry out in good faith by the two country and that all pretense be remove for interference with our commerce for any purpose whatever by a foreign government while therefore the united states have be stand up for the freedom of the sea they have not think proper to make that a pretext for avoid a fulfillment of their treaty stipulation or a ground for give countenance to a trade reprobate by our law a similar arrangement by the other great power could not fail to sweep from the ocean the slave trade without the interpolation of any new principle into the maritime code we may be permit to hope that the example thus set will be follow by some if not all of they we thereby also afford suitable protection to the fair trader in those sea thus fulfil at the same time the dictate of a sound policy and comply with the claim of justice and humanity
 it would have furnish additional cause for congratulation if the treaty could have embrace all subject calculate in future to lead to a misunderstanding between the two government the territory of the united states commonly call the oregon territory lie on the pacific ocean north of the forty second degree of latitude to a portion of which great britain lay claim begin to attract the attention of our fellow citizen and the tide of population which have reclaim what be so lately an unbroken wilderness in more contiguous region be prepare to flow over those vast district which stretch from the rocky mountains to the pacific ocean in advance of the acquirement of individual right to these land sound policy dictate that every effort should be resort to by the two government to settle their respective claim it become manifest at an early hour of the late negotiation that any attempt for the time be satisfactorily to determine those right would lead to a protract discussion which might embrace in its failure other more pressing matter and the executive do not regard it as proper to waive all the advantage of an honorable adjustment of other difficulty of great magnitude and importance because this not so immediately press stand in the way although the difficulty refer to may not for several year to come involve the peace of the two country yet i shall not delay to urge on great britain the importance of its early settlement nor will other matter of commercial importance to the two country be overlook and i have good reason to believe that it will comport with the policy of england as it do with that of the united states to seize upon this moment when most of the cause of irritation have pass away to cement the peace and amity of the two country by wisely remove all ground of probable future collision
 with the other power of europe our relation continue on the most amicable footing treaty now exist with they should be rigidly observe and every opportunity compatible with the interest of the united states should be seize upon to enlarge the basis of commercial intercourse peace with all the world be the true foundation of our policy which can only be render permanent by the practice of equal and impartial justice to all our great desire should be to enter only into that rivalry which look to the general good in the cultivation of the science the enlargement of the field for the exercise of the mechanical art and the spread of commerce that great civilizer to every land and sea carefully abstain from interference in all question exclusively refer themselves to the political interest of europe we may be permit to hope an equal exemption from the interference of european governments in what relate to the states of the american continent

 the present tariff of duty be somewhat hastily and hurriedly pass near the close of the late session of congress that it should have defect can therefore be surprising to no one to remedy such defect as may be find to exist in any of its numerous provision will not fail to claim your serious attention it may well merit inquiry whether the exaction of all duty in cash do not call for the introduction of a system which have prove highly beneficial in country where it have be adopt i refer to the warehousing system the first and most prominent effect which it would produce would be to protect the market alike against redundant or deficient supply of foreign fabric both of which in the long run be injurious as well to the manufacturer as the importer the quantity of good in store be at all time readily know it would enable the importer with an approach to accuracy to ascertain the actual want of the market and to regulate himself accordingly if however he should fall into error by import an excess above the public want he could readily correct its evil by avail himself of the benefit and advantage of the system thus establish in the storehouse the good import would await the demand of the market and their issue would be govern by the fix principle of demand and supply thus an approximation would be make to a steadiness and uniformity of price which if attainable would conduce to the decide advantage of mercantile and mechanical operation
 the apprehension may be well entertain that without something to ameliorate the rigor of cash payment the entire import trade may fall into the hand of a few wealthy capitalist in this country and in europe the small importer who require all the money he can raise for investment abroad and who can but ill afford to pay the low duty would have to subduct in advance a portion of his fund in order to pay the duty and would lose the interest upon the amount thus pay for all the time the good might remain unsold which might absorb his profit the rich capitalist abroad as well as at home would thus possess after a short time an almost exclusive monopoly of the import trade and law design for the benefit of all would thus operate for the benefit of a few a result wholly uncongenial with the spirit of our institution and antirepublican in all its tendency the warehousing system would enable the importer to watch the market and to select his own time for offer his good for sale a profitable portion of the carrying trade in article enter for the benefit of drawback must also be most seriously affect without the adoption of some expedient to relieve the cash system the warehousing system would afford that relief since the carrier would have a safe recourse to the public storehouse and might without advance the duty reship within some reasonable period to foreign port a further effect of the measure would be to supersede the system of drawback thereby effectually protect the government against fraud as the right of debenture would not attach to good after their withdrawal from the public store
 in revise the exist tariff of duty should you deem it proper to do so at your present session i can only repeat the suggestion and recommendation which upon several occasion i have heretofore feel it to be my duty to offer to congress the great primary and control interest of the american people be union union not only in the mere form of government form which may be break but union round in an attachment of states and individual for each other this union in sentiment and feeling can only be preserve by the adoption of that course of policy which neither give exclusive benefit to some nor impose unnecessary burthen upon other shall consult the interest of all by pursue a course of moderation and thereby seek to harmonize public opinion and cause the people everywhere to feel and to know that the government be careful of the interest of all alike nor be there any subject in regard to which moderation connect with a wise discrimination be more necessary than in the imposition of duty on import whether reference be have to revenue the primary object in the imposition of taxis or to the incident which necessarily flow from their imposition this be entirely true extravagant duty defeat their end and object not only by exciting in the public mind an hostility to the manufacturing interest but by induce a system of smuggling on an extensive scale and the practice of every manner of fraud upon the revenue which the utmost vigilance of government can not effectually suppress an opposite course of policy would be attend by result essentially different of which every interest of society and none more than those of the manufacturer would reap important advantage among the most striking of its benefit would be that derive from the general acquiescence of the country in its support and the consequent permanency and stability which would be give to all the operation of industry it can not be too often repeat that no system of legislation can be wise which be fluctuate and uncertain no interest can thrive under it the prudent capitalist will never adventure his capital in manufacturing establishment or in any other lead pursuit of life if there exist a state of uncertainty as to whether the government will repeal to morrow what it have enact to day fitful profit however high if threaten with a ruinous reduction by a vacillate policy on the part of government will scarcely tempt he to trust the money which he have acquire by a life of labor upon the uncertain adventure i therefore in the spirit of conciliation and influence by no other desire than to rescue the great interest of the country from the vortex of political contention and in the discharge of the high and solemn duty of the place which i now occupy recommend moderate duty impose with a wise discrimination as to their several object as be not only most likely to be durable but most advantageous to every interest of society

 at peace with all the world the personal liberty of the citizen sacredly maintain and his right secure under political institution derive all their authority from the direct sanction of the people with a soil fertile almost beyond example and a country bless with every diversity of climate and production what remain to be do in order to advance the happiness and prosperity of such a people under ordinary circumstance this inquiry could readily be answer the good that probably could be do for a people inhabit such a country would be to fortify their peace and security in the prosecution of their various pursuit by guard they against invasion from without and violence from within the rest for the great part might be leave to their own energy and enterprise the chief embarrassment which at the moment exhibit themselves have arise from overaction and the most difficult task which remain to be accomplish be that of correct and overcome its effect between the year 1833 and 1838 addition be make to bank capital and bank issue in the form of note design for circulation to an extent enormously great the question seem to be not how the good currency could be provide but in what manner the great amount of bank paper could be put in circulation thus a vast amount of what be call money since for the time be it answer the purpose of money be throw upon the country an overissue which be attend as a necessary consequence by an extravagant increase of the price of all article of property the spread of a speculative mania all over the country and have finally end in a general indebtedness on the part of states and individual the prostration of public and private credit a depreciation in the market value of real and personal estate and have leave large district of country almost entirely without any circulate medium in view of the fact that in 1830 the whole bank note circulation within the united states amount to but $ 61,323,898 accord to the treasury statement and that an addition have be make thereto of the enormous sum of $ 88,000,000 in seven year the circulation on the 1st of january 1837 be state at $ 149,185,890 aid by the great facility afford in obtain loan from european capitalist who be seize with the same speculative mania which prevail in the united states and the large importation of fund from abroad the result of stock sale and loan no one can be surprised at the apparent but unsubstantial state of prosperity which everywhere prevail over the land and as little cause of surprise should be feel at the present prostration of everything and the ruin which have befall so many of our fellow citizen in the sudden withdrawal from circulation of so large an amount of bank issue since 1837 -exceeding as be believe the amount add to the paper currency for a similar period antecedent to 1837 -it cease to be a matter of astonishment that such extensive shipwreck should have be make of private fortune or that difficulty should exist in meet their engagement on the part of the debtor state apart from which if there be take into account the immense loss sustain in the dishonor of numerous bank it be less a matter of surprise that insolvency should have visit many of our fellow citizen than that so many should have escape the blight influence of the time
 in the solemn conviction of these truth and with an ardent desire to meet the press necessity of the country i feel it to be my duty to cause to be submit to you at the commencement of your last session the plan of an exchequer the whole power and duty of maintain which in purity and vigor be to be exercise by the representative of the people and the states and therefore virtually by the people themselves it be propose to place it under the control and direction of a treasury board to consist of three commissioner whose duty it should be to see that the law of its creation be faithfully execute and that the great end of supply a paper medium of exchange at all time convertible into gold and silver should be attain the board thus constitute be give as much permanency as could be impart to it without endanger the proper share of responsibility which should attach to all public agent in order to insure all the advantage of a well mature experience the commissioner be to hold their office for the respective period of two four and six year thereby secure at all time in the management of the exchequer the service of two man of experience and to place they in a condition to exercise perfect independence of mind and action it be provide that their removal should only take place for actual incapacity or infidelity to the trust and to be follow by the president with an exposition of the cause of such removal should it occur it be propose to establish subordinate board in each of the states under the same restriction and limitation of the power of removal which with the central board should receive safely keep and disburse the public money and in order to furnish a sound paper medium of exchange the exchequer should retain of the revenue of the government a sum not to exceed $ 5,000,000 in specie to be set apart as require by its operation and to pay the public creditor at his own option either in specie or treasury note of denomination not less than $ 5 nor exceed $ 100 which note should be redeem at the several place of issue and to be receivable at all time and everywhere in payment of government due with a restraint upon such issue of bill that the same should not exceed the maximum of $ 15,000,000 in order to guard against all the hazards incident to fluctuation in trade the secretary of the treasury be invest with authority to issue $ 5,000,000 of government stock should the same at any time be regard as necessary in order to place beyond hazard the prompt redemption of the bill which might be throw into circulation thus in fact make the issue of $ 15,000,000 of exchequer bill rest substantially on $ 10,000,000 and keep in circulation never more than one and one half dollar for every dollar in specie when to this it be add that the bill be not only everywhere receivable in government due but that the government itself would be bind for their ultimate redemption no rational doubt can exist that the paper which the exchequer would furnish would readily enter into general circulation and be maintain at all time at or above par with gold and silver thereby realize the great want of the age and fulfil the wish of the people in order to reimburse the government the expense of the plan it be propose to invest the exchequer with the limited authority to deal in bill of exchange unless prohibit by the state in which an agency might be situate have only thirty day to run and rest on a fair and bona fide basis the legislative will on this point might be so plainly announce as to avoid all pretext for partiality or favoritism it be furthermore propose to invest this treasury agent with authority to receive on deposit to a limited amount the specie fund of individual and to grant certificate therefor to be redeem on presentation under the idea which be believe to be well found that such certificate would come in aid of the exchequer bill in supply a safe and ample paper circulation or if in place of the contemplated dealing in exchange the exchequer should be authorize not only to exchange its bill for actual deposit of specie but for specie or its equivalent to sell draft charge therefor a small but reasonable premium i can not doubt but that the benefit of the law would be speedily manifest in the revival of the credit trade and business of the whole country entertain this opinion it become my duty to urge its adoption upon congress by reference to the strong consideration of the public interest with such alteration in its detail as congress may in its wisdom see fit to make
 i be well aware that this propose alteration and amendment of the law establish the treasury department have encounter various objection and that among other it have be proclaim a government bank of fearful and dangerous import it be propose to confer upon it no extraordinary power it purport to do no more than pay the debt of the government with the redeemable paper of the government in which respect it accomplish precisely what the treasury do daily at this time in issue to the public creditor the treasury note which under law it be authorize to issue it have no resemblance to an ordinary bank as it furnish no profit to private stockholder and lend no capital to individual if it be object to as a government bank and the objection be available then should all the law in relation to the treasury be repeal and the capacity of the government to collect what be due to it or pay what it owe be abrogate
 this be the chief purpose of the propose exchequer and surely if in the accomplishment of a purpose so essential it afford a sound circulate medium to the country and facility to trade it should be regard as no slight recommendation of it to public consideration properly guard by the provision of law it can run into no dangerous evil nor can any abuse arise under it but such as the legislature itself will be answerable for if it be tolerate since it be but the creature of the law and be susceptible at all time of modification amendment or repeal at the pleasure of congress i know that it have be object that the system would be liable to be abuse by the legislature by whom alone it could be abuse in the party conflict of the day that such abuse would manifest itself in a change of the law which would authorize an excessive issue of paper for the purpose of inflate price and win popular favor to that it may be answer that the ascription of such a motive to congress be altogether gratuitous and inadmissible the theory of our institution would lead we to a different conclusion but a perfect security against a proceeding so reckless would be find to exist in the very nature of thing the political party which should be so blind to the true interest of the country as to resort to such an expedient would inevitably meet with final overthrow in the fact that the moment the paper cease to be convertible into specie or otherwise promptly redeem it would become worthless and would in the end dishonor the government involve the people in ruin and such political party in hopeless disgrace at the same time such a view involve the utter impossibility of furnish any currency other than that of the precious metal for if the government itself can not forego the temptation of excessive paper issue what reliance can be place in corporation upon whom the temptation of individual aggrandizement would most strongly operate the people would have to blame none but themselves for any injury that might arise from a course so reckless since their agent would be the wrongdoer and they the passive spectator
 there can be but three kind of public currency first gold and silver second the paper of state institution or third a representative of the precious metal provide by the general government or under its authority the subtreasury system reject the last in any form and as it be believe that no reliance could be place on the issue of local institution for the purpose of general circulation it necessarily and unavoidably adopt specie as the exclusive currency for its own use and this must ever be the case unless one of the other kind be use the choice in the present state of public sentiment lie between an exclusive specie currency on the one hand and government issue of some kind on the other that these issue can not be make by a chartered institution be suppose to be conclusively settle they must be make then directly by government agent for several year past they have be thus make in the form of treasury note and have answer a valuable purpose their usefulness have be limit by their be transient and temporary their cease to bear interest at give period necessarily cause their speedy return and thus restrict their range of circulation and be use only in the disbursement of government they can not reach those point where they be most require by render their use permanent to the moderate extent already mention by offer no inducement for their return and by exchange they for coin and other value they will constitute to a certain extent the general currency so much need to maintain the internal trade of the country and this be the exchequer plan so far as it may operate in furnish a currency
 i can not forego the occasion to urge its importance to the credit of the government in a financial point of view the great necessity of resort to every proper and become expedient in order to place the treasury on a footing of the high respectability be entirely obvious the credit of the government may be regard as the very soul of the government itself a principle of vitality without which all its movement be languid and all its operation embarrass in this spirit the executive feel itself bind by the most imperative sense of duty to submit to congress at its last session the propriety of make a specific pledge of the land fund as the basis for the negotiation of the loan authorize to be contract i then think that such an application of the public domain would without doubt have place at the command of the government ample fund to relieve the treasury from the temporary embarrassment under which it labor american credit have suffer a considerable shock in europe from the large indebtedness of the states and the temporary inability of some of they to meet the interest on their debt the utter and disastrous prostration of the united states bank of pennsylvania have contribute largely to increase the sentiment of distrust by reason of the loss and ruin sustain by the holder of its stock a large portion of whom be foreigner and many of whom be alike ignorant of our political organization and of our actual responsibility
 it be the anxious desire of the executive that in the effort to negotiate the loan abroad the american negotiator might be able to point the money lender to the fund mortgage for the redemption of the principal and interest of any loan he might contract and thereby vindicate the government from all suspicion of bad faith or inability to meet its engagement congress differ from the executive in this view of the subject it become nevertheless the duty of the executive to resort to every expedient in its power to do so
 after a failure in the american market a citizen of high character and talent be send to europe with no well success and thus the mortifying spectacle have be present of the inability of this government to obtain a loan so small as not in the whole to amount to more than one fourth of its ordinary annual income at a time when the governments of europe although involve in debt and with their subject heavily burthen with taxation readily obtain loan of any amount at a greatly reduce rate of interest it would be unprofitable to look far into this anomalous state of thing but i can not conclude without add that for a government which have pay off its debt of two war with the large maritime power of europe and now owe a debt which be almost next to nothing when compare with its boundless resource a government the strong in the world because emanating from the popular will and firmly rooted in the affection of a great and free people and whose fidelity to its engagement have never be question for such a government to have tender to the capitalist of other country an opportunity for a small investment in its stock and yet to have fail imply either the most unfounded distrust in its good faith or a purpose to obtain which the course pursue be the most fatal which could have be adopt it have now become obvious to all man that the government must look to its own mean for supply its want and it be console to know that these mean be altogether adequate for the object the exchequer if adopt will greatly aid in bring about this result upon what i regard as a well rounded supposition that its bill would be readily seek for by the public creditor and that the issue would in a short time reach the maximum of $ 15,000,000 it be obvious that $ 10,000,000 would thereby be add to the available mean of the treasury without cost or charge nor can i fail to urge the great and beneficial effect which would be produce in aid of all the active pursuit of life its effect upon the solvent state bank while it would force into liquidation those of an opposite character through its weekly settlement would be highly beneficial and with the advantage of a sound currency the restoration of confidence and credit would follow with a numerous train of blessing my conviction be most strong that these benefit would flow from the adoption of this measure but if the result should be adverse there be this security in connection with it that the law create it may be repeal at the pleasure of the legislature without the slight implication of its good faith
 i recommend to congress to take into consideration the propriety of reimburse a fine impose on general jackson at new orleans at the time of the attack and defense of that city and pay by he without design any reflection on the judicial tribunal which impose the fine the remission at this day may be regard as not unjust or inexpedient the voice of the civil authority be hear amidst the glitter of arm and obey by those who hold the sword thereby give additional luster to a memorable military achievement if the law be offend their majesty be fully vindicate and although the penalty incur and pay be worthy of little regard in a pecuniary point of view it can hardly be doubt that it would be gratify to the war wear veteran now in retirement and in the winter of his day to be relieve from the circumstance in which that judgment place he there be case in which public functionary may be call on to weigh the public interest against their own personal hazard and if the civil law be violate from praiseworthy motive or an overruling sense of public danger and public necessity punishment may well be restrain within that limit which assert and maintain the authority of the law and the subjection of the military to the civil power the defense of new orleans while it save a city from the hand of the enemy place the name of general jackson among those of the great captain of the age and illustrate one of the bright page of our history now that the cause of excitement exist at the time have cease to operate it be believe that the remission of this fine and whatever of gratification that remission might cause the eminent man who incur and pay it would be in accordance with the general feeling and wish of the american people
 i have thus fellow citizen acquit myself of my duty under the constitution by lay before you as succinctly as i have be able the state of the union and by invite your attention to measure of much importance to the country the executive will most zealously unite its effort with those of the legislative department in the accomplishment of all that be require to relieve the want of a common constituency or elevate the destiny of a beloved country

to the senate and house of representatives of the united states
 i communicate herewith to congress copy of a correspondence which have recently take place between certain agent of the government of the hawaiian or sandwich islands and the secretary of state
 the condition of those island have excite a good deal of interest which be increase by every successive proof that their inhabitant be make progress in civilization and become more and more competent to maintain regular and orderly civil government they lie in the pacific ocean much near to this continent than the other and have become an important place for the refitment and provisioning of american and european vessel
 owe to their locality and to the course of the wind which prevail in this quarter of the world the sandwich islands be the stop place for almost all vessel pass from continent to continent across the pacific ocean they be especially resort to by the great number of vessel of the united states which be engage in the whale fishery in those sea the number of vessel of all sort and the amount of property own by citizen of the united states which be find in those island in the course of the year be state probably with sufficient accuracy in the letter of the agent
 just emerge from a state of barbarism the government of the island be as yet feeble but its disposition appear to be just and pacific and it seem anxious to improve the condition of its people by the introduction of knowledge of religious and moral institution mean of education and the art of civilized life
 it can not but be in conformity with the interest and wish of the government and the people of the united states that this community thus exist in the midst of a vast expanse of ocean should be respect and all its right strictly and conscientiously regard and this must also be the true interest of all other commercial state far remote from the dominion of european power its growth and prosperity as an independent state may yet be in a high degree useful to all whose trade be extend to those region while its near approach to this continent and the intercourse which american vessel have with it such vessel constitute five sixth of all which annually visit it could not but create dissatisfaction on the part of the united states at any attempt by another power should such attempt be threaten or fear to take possession of the island colonize they and subvert the native government consider therefore that the united states possess so large a share of the intercourse with those island it be deem not unfit to make the declaration that their government seek nevertheless no peculiar advantage no exclusive control over the hawaiian government but be content with its independent existence and anxiously wish for its security and prosperity its forbearance in this respect under the circumstance of the very large intercourse of their citizen with the island would justify this government should event hereafter arise to require it in make a decide remonstrance against the adoption of an opposite policy by any other power under the circumstance i recommend to congress to provide for a moderate allowance to be make out of the treasury to the consul reside there that in a government so new and a country so remote american citizen may have respectable authority to which to apply for redress in case of injury to their person and property and to whom the government of the country may also make know any act commit by american citizen of which it may think it have a right to complain
 event of considerable importance have recently transpire in china the military operation carry on against that empire by the english government have be terminate by a treaty accord to the term of which four important port hitherto shut against foreign commerce be to be open to british merchant viz amoy foo choo foo ningpo and chinghai it can not but be interesting to the mercantile interest of the united states whose intercourse with china at the single port of canton have already become so considerable to ascertain whether these other port now open to british commerce be to remain shut nevertheless against the commerce of the united states the treaty between the chinese government and the british commissioner provide neither for the admission nor the exclusion of the ship of other nation it would seem therefore that it remain with every other nation have commercial intercourse with china to seek to make proper arrangement for itself with the government of that empire in this respect
 the importation into the united states from china be know to be large having amount in some year as will be see by the annexed table to $ 9,000,000 the export too from the united states to china constitute an interesting and grow part of the commerce of the country it appear that in the year 1841 in the direct trade between the two country the value of the export from the united states amount to $ 715,000 in domestic produce and $ 485,000 in foreign merchandise but the whole amount of american produce which finally reach china and be there consume be not comprise in these table which show only the direct trade many vessel with american product on board sail with a primary destination to other country but ultimately dispose of more or less of their cargo in the port of canton
 the peculiarity of the chinese government and the chinese character be well know an empire suppose to contain 300,000,000 subject fertile in various rich product of the earth not without the knowledge of letter and of many art and with large and expensive accommodation for internal intercourse and traffic have for age seek to exclude the visit of stranger and foreigner from its dominion and have assume for itself a superiority over all other nation event appear likely to break down and soften this spirit of nonintercourse and to bring china ere long into the relation which usually subsist between civilized state she have agree in the treaty with england that correspondence between the agent of the two government shall be on equal term a concession which it be hardly probable will hereafter be withhold from other nation
 it be true that the cheapness of labor among the chinese their ingenuity in its application and the fixed character of their habit and pursuit may discourage the hope of the opening of any great and sudden demand for the fabric of other country but experience prove that the production of western nation find a market to some extent among the chinese that that market so far as respect the production of the united states although it have considerably vary in successive season have on the whole more than double within the last ten year and it can hardly be doubt that the opening of several new and important port connect with part of the empire heretofore seldom visit by europeans or americans would exercise a favorable influence upon the demand for such production
 it be not understand that the immediate establishment of correspondent embassy and mission or the permanent residence of diplomatic functionary with full power of each country at the court of the other be contemplate between england and china although as have be already observe it have be stipulate that intercourse between the two country shall hereafter be on equal term an ambassador or envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary can only be accredit accord to the usage of western nation to the head or sovereign of the state and it may be doubtful whether the court of pekin be yet prepared to conform to these usage so far as to receive a minister plenipotentiary to reside near it
 be of opinion however that the commercial interest of the united states connect with china require at the present moment a degree of attention and vigilance such as there be no agent of this government on the spot to bestow i recommend to congress to make appropriation for the compensation of a commissioner to reside in china to exercise a watchful care over the concern of american citizen and for the protection of their person and property empower to hold intercourse with the local authority and ready under instruction from his government should such instruction become necessary and proper hereafter to address himself to the high functionary of the empire or through they to the emperor himself
 it will not escape the observation of congress that in order to secure the important object of any such measure a citizen of much intelligence and weight of character should be employ on such agency and that to secure the service of such an individual a compensation should be make corresponding with the magnitude and importance of the mission

to the senate and house of representatives of the united states

 the germanic association of customs and commerce which since its establishment in 1833 have be steadily grow in power and importance and consist at this time of more than twenty german states and embrace a population of 27,000,000 people unite for all fire purpose of commercial intercourse with each other and with foreign state offer to the latter the most valuable exchange on principle more liberal than be offer in the fiscal system of any other european power from its origin the importance of the german union have never be lose sight of by the united states the industry morality and other valuable quality of the german nation have always be well know and appreciate on this subject i invite the attention of congress to the report of the secretary of state from which it will be see that while our cotton be admit free of duty and the duty on rice have be much reduce which have already lead to a greatly increase consumption a strong disposition have be recently evince by that great body to reduce upon certain condition their present duty upon tobacco this be the first intimation of a concession on this interesting subject ever make by any european power i can not but regard it as well calculate to remove the only impediment which have so far exist to the most liberal commercial intercourse between we and they in this view our minister at berlin who have heretofore industriously pursue the subject have be instruct to enter upon the negotiation of a commercial treaty which while it will open new advantage to the agricultural interest of the united states and a more free and expand field for commercial operation will affect injuriously no exist interest of the union should the negotiation be crown with success its result will be communicate to both houses of congress
 i communicate herewith certain dispatch receive from our minister at mexico and also a correspondence which have recently occur between the envoy from that republic and the secretary of state it must but be regard as not a little extraordinary that the government of mexico in anticipation of a public discussion which it have be pleased to infer from newspaper publication as likely to take place in congress relate to the annexation of texas to the united states should have so far anticipate the result of such discussion as to have announce its determination to visit any such anticipated decision by a formal declaration of war against the united states if design to prevent congress from introduce that question as a fit subject for its calm deliberation and final judgment the executive have no reason to doubt that it will entirely fail of its object the representative of a brave and patriotic people will suffer no apprehension of future consequence to embarrass they in the course of their propose deliberation nor will the executive department of the government fail for any such cause to discharge its whole duty to the country
 the war which have exist for so long a time between mexico and texas have since the battle of san jacinto consist for the most part of predatory incursion which while they have be attend with much of suffer to individual and have keep the border of the two country in a state of constant alarm have fail to approach to any definitive result mexico have fit out no formidable armament by land or by sea for the subjugation of texas eight year have now elapse since texas declare her independence of mexico and during that time she have be recognize as a sovereign power by several of the principal civilized state mexico nevertheless persevere in her plan of reconqu and refuse to recognize her independence the predatory incursion to which i have allude have be attend in one instance with the breaking up of the court of justice by the seizing upon the person of the judge jury and officer of the court and drag they along with unarmed and therefore noncombatant citizen into a cruel and oppressive bondage thus leave crime to go unpunished and immorality to pass unreproved a border warfare be evermore to be deprecate and over such a war as have exist for so many year between these two states humanity have have great cause to lament nor be such a condition of thing to be deplore only because of the individual suffering attendant upon it the effect be far more extensive the creator of the universe have give man the earth for his resting place and its fruit for his subsistence whatever therefore shall make the first or any part of it a scene of desolation affect injuriously his heritage and may be regard as a general calamity war may sometimes be necessary but all nation have a common interest in bring they speedily to a close the united states have an immediate interest in see an end put to the state of hostility exist between mexico and texas they be our neighbor of the same continent with whom we be not only desirous of cultivate the relation of amity but of the most extended commercial intercourse and to practice all the rite of a neighborhood hospitality our own interest be involve in the matter since however neutral may be our course of policy we can not hope to escape the effect of a spirit of jealousy on the part of both of the power nor can this government be indifferent to the fact that a warfare such as be wage between those two nation be calculate to weaken both power and finally to render they and especially the weak of the two the subject of interference on the part of strong and more powerful nation who intent only on advance their own peculiar view may soon or later attempt to bring about a compliance with term as the condition of their interposition alike derogatory to the nation grant they and detrimental to the interest of the united states we could not be expect quietly to permit any such interference to our disadvantage consider that texas be separate from the united states by a mere geographical line that her territory in the opinion of many down to a late period form a portion of the territory of the united states that it be homogeneous in its population and pursuit with adjoining state make contribution to the commerce of the world in the same article with they and that most of her inhabitant have be citizen of the united states speak the same language and live under similar political institution with ourselves this government be bind by every consideration of interest as well as of sympathy to see that she shall be leave free to act especially in regard to her domestic affair unawe by force and unrestrained by the policy or view of other country in full view of all these consideration the executive have not hesitate to express to the government of mexico how deeply it deprecate a continuance of the war and how anxiously it desire to witness its termination i can not but think that it become the united states as the old of the american republics to hold a language to mexico upon this subject of an unambiguous character it be time that this war have cease there must be a limit to all war and if the parent state after an eight years&#39 struggle have fail to reduce to submission a portion of its subject stand out in revolt against it and who have not only proclaim themselves to be independent but have be recognize as such by other power she ought not to expect that other nation will quietly look on to their obvious injury upon a protraction of hostility these united states throw off their colonial dependence and establish independent government and great britain after having waste her energy in the attempt to subdue they for a less period than mexico have attempt to subjugate texas have the wisdom and justice to acknowledge their independence thereby recognize the obligation which rest on she as one of the family of nation an example thus set by one of the proud as well as most powerful nation of the earth it could in no way disparage mexico to imitate while therefore the executive would deplore any collision with mexico or any disturbance of the friendly relation which exist between the two country it can not permit that government to control its policy whatever it may be toward texas but will treat she as by the recognition of her independence the united states have long since declare they would do as entirely independent of mexico the high obligation of public duty may enforce from the constituted authority of the united states a policy which the course persevere in by mexico will have mainly contribute to produce and the executive in such a touting they will with confidence throw itself upon the patriotism of the people to sustain the government in its course of action

 the receipt into the treasury for the calendar year 1843 exclusive of loan be little more than $ 18,000,000 and the expenditure exclusive of the payment on the public debt will have be about $ 23,000,000 by the act of 1842 a new arrangement of the fiscal year be make so that it should commence on the 1st day of july in each year the account and estimate for the current fiscal year will show that the loan and treasury note make and issue before the close of the last congress to meet the anticipated deficiency have not be entirely adequate although on the 1st of october last there be a balance in the treasury in consequence of the provision thus make of $ 3,914,082.77 yet the appropriation already make by congress will absorb that balance and leave a probable deficiency of $ 2,000,000 at the close of the present fiscal year there be outstanding treasury note to about the amount of $ 4,600,000 and should they be return upon the treasury during the fiscal year they will require provision for their redemption i do not however regard this as probable since they have obviously enter into the currency of the country and will continue to form a portion of it if the system now adopt be continue the loan of 1841 amount to $ 5,672,976.88 fall due on the 1st day of january 1845 and must be provide for or postpone by a new loan and unless the resource of revenue should be materially increase by you there will be a probable deficiency for the service of the fiscal year end june 30 1845 of upward of $ 4,000,000
 the delusion incident to an enormously excessive paper circulation which give a fictitious value to everything and stimulate adventure and speculation to an extravagant extent have be happily succeed by the substitution of the precious metal and paper promptly redeemable in specie and thus false value have disappear and a sounder condition of thing have be introduce this transition although intimately connect with the prosperity of the country have nevertheless be attend with much embarrassment to the government in its financial concern so long as the foreign importer could receive payment for their cargo in a currency of greatly less value than that in europe but fully available here in the purchase of our agricultural production their profit be immeasurably augment by the operation the shipment be large and the revenue of the government become superabundant but the change in the character of the circulation from a nominal and apparently real value in the first stage of its existence to an obviously depreciate value in its second so that it no long answer the purpose of exchange or barter and its ultimate substitution by a sound metallic and paper circulation combine have be attend by diminish importation and a consequent fall off in the revenue this have induce congress from 1837 to resort to the expedient of issue treasury note and finally of fund they in order to supply deficiency i can not however withhold the remark that it be in no way compatible with the dignity of the government that a public debt should be create in time of peace to meet the current expense of the government or that temporary expedient should be resort to an hour long than it be possible to avoid they the executive can do no more than apply the mean which congress place in its hand for the support of government and happily for the good of the country and for the preservation of its liberty it possess no power to levy exaction on the people or to force from they contribution to the public revenue in any form it can only recommend such measure as may in its opinion be call for by the want of the public service to congress with whom alone rest the power to lay and collect taxis duty impost and excise this duty have upon several occasion heretofore be perform the present condition of thing give flattering promise that trade and commerce be rapidly revive and fortunately for the country the source of revenue have only to be open in order to prove abundant
 while we can anticipate no considerable increase in the proceed of the sale of the public land for reason perfectly obvious to all for several year to come yet the public land can not otherwise than be regard as the foundation of the public credit with so large a body of the most fertile land in the world under the control and at the disposal of this government no one can reasonably doubt the entire ability to meet its engagement under every emergency in season of trial and difficulty similar to those through which we be pass the capitalist make his investment in the government cut stock with the most assured confidence of ultimate reimbursement and whatever may be say of a period of great financial prosperity such as exist for some year after 1833 i should regard it as suicidal in a season of financial embarrassment either to alienate the land themselves or the proceed arise from their sale the first and paramount duty of those to whom may be intrust the administration of public affair be to guard the public credit in reestablish the credit of this central government the readiest and most obvious mode be take to restore the credit of the states the extremity can only be make sound by produce a healthy action in the central government and the history of the present day fully establish the fact that an increase in the value of the stock of this government will in a great majority of instance be attend by an increase in the value of the stock of the states it should therefore be a matter of general congratulation that amidst all the embarrassment arise from surround circumstance the credit of the government should have be so fully restore that it have be enable to effect a loan of $ 7,000,000 to redeem that amount of treasury note on term more favorable than any that have be offer for many year and the 6 per cent stock which be create in 1842 have advance in the hand of the holder nearly 20 per cent above its par value the confidence of the people in the integrity of their government have thus be signally manifest these opinion relative to the public land do not in any manner conflict with the observance of the most liberal policy toward those of our fellow citizen who press forward into the wilderness and be the pioneer in the work of its reclamation in securing to all such their right of preemption the government perform but an act of retributive justice for suffering encounter and hardship endure and find ample remuneration in the comfort which its policy insure and the happiness which it impart
 should a revision of the tariff with a view to revenue become necessary in the estimation of congress i doubt not you will approach the subject with a just and enlighten regard to the interest of the whole union the principle and view which i have heretofore have occasion to submit remain unchanged it can however never be too often repeat that the prominent interest of every important pursuit of life require for success permanency and stability in legislation these can only be attain by adopt as the basis of action moderation in all thing which be as indispensably necessary to secure the harmonious action of the political as of the animal system in our political organization no one section of the country should desire to have its suppose interest advance at the sacrifice of all other but union be the great interest equally precious to all should be foster and sustain by mutual concession and the cultivation of that spirit of compromise from which the constitution itself proceed
 you will be inform by the report from the treasury department of the measure take under the act of the last session authorize the reissue of treasury note in lieu of those then outstanding the system adopt in pursuance of exist law seem well calculate to save the country a large amount of interest while it afford convenience and obviate danger and expense in the transmission of fund to disburse agent i refer you also to that report for the mean propose by the secretary to increase the revenue and particularly to that portion of it which relate to the subject of the warehousing system which i earnestly urge upon congress at its last session and as to the importance of which my opinion have undergo no change
 in view of the disorder condition of the currency at the time and the high rate of exchange between different part of the country i feel it to be incumbent on i to present to the consideration of your predecessor a proposition conflict in no degree with the constitution or with the right of the states and have the sanction not in detail but in principle of some of the eminent man who have precede i in the executive office that proposition contemplate the issuing of treasury note of denomination of not less than $ 5 nor more than $ 100 to be employ in the payment of the obligation of the government in lieu of gold and silver at the option of the public creditor and to an amount not exceed $ 15,000,000 it be propose to make they receivable everywhere and to establish at various point depository of gold and silver to be hold in trust for the redemption of such note so as to insure their convertibility into specie no doubt be entertain that such note would have maintain a par value with gold and silver thus furnish a paper currency of equal value over the union thereby meet the just expectation of the people and fulfil the duty of a parental government whether the depository should be permit to sell or purchase bill under very limited restriction together with all its other detail be submit to the wisdom of congress and be regard as of secondary importance i think then and think now that such an arrangement would have be attend with the happy result the whole matter of the currency would have be place where by the constitution it be design to be place under the immediate supervision and control of congress the action of the government would have be independent of all corporation and the same eye which rest unceasingly on the specie currency and guard it against adulteration would also have rest on the paper currency to control and regulate its issue and protect it against depreciation the same reason which would forbid congress from part with the power over the coinage would seem to operate with nearly equal force hi regard to any substitution for the precious metal in the form of a circulate medium paper when substitute for specie constitute a standard of value by which the operation of society be regulate and whatsoever cause its depreciation affect society to an extent nearly if not quite equal to the adulteration of the coin nor can i withhold the remark that its advantage contrast with a bank of the united states apart from the fact that a bank be esteem as obnoxious to the public sentiment as well on the score of expediency as of constitutionality appear to i to be strike and obvious the relief which a bank would afford by an issue of $ 15,000,000 of its note judge from the experience of the late united states bank would not have occur in less than fifteen year whereas under the propose arrangement the relief arise from the issue of $ 15,000,000 of treasury note would have be consummate in one year thus furnish in one fifteenth part of the time in which a bank could have accomplish it a paper medium of exchange equal in amount to the real want of the country at par value with gold and silver the saving to the government would have be equal to all the interest which it have have to pay on treasury note of previous as well as subsequent issue thereby relieve the government and at the same time afford relief to the people under all the responsibility attach to the station which i occupy and in redemption of a pledge give to the last congress at the close of its first session i submit the suggestion to its consideration at two consecutive session the recommendation however meet with no favor at its hand while i be free to admit that the necessity of the time have since become greatly ameliorate and that there be good reason to hope that the country be safely and rapidly emerge from the difficulty and embarrassment which everywhere surround it in 1841 yet i can not but think that its restoration to a sound and healthy condition would be greatly expedite by a resort to the expedient in a modify form
 the operation of the treasury now rest upon the act of 1789 and the resolution of 1816 and those law have be so administer as to produce as great a quantum of good to the country as their provision be capable of yield if there have be any distinct expression of opinion go to show that public sentiment be averse to the plan either as heretofore recommend to congress or in a modify form while my own opinion in regard to it would remain unchanged i should be very far from again present it to your consideration the government have originate with the states and the people for their own benefit and advantage and it would be subversive of the foundation principle of the political edifice which they have rear to persevere in a measure which in their mature judgment they have either repudiate or condemn the will of our constituent clearly express should be regard as the light to guide our footstep the true difference between a monarchical or aristocratical government and a republic be that in the first the will of the few prevail over the will of the many while in the last the will of the many should be alone consult
 the report of the secretary of war will bring you acquainted with the condition of that important branch of the public service the army may be regard in consequence of the small number of the rank and file in each company and regiment as little more than a nucleus around which to rally the military force of the country in case of war and yet its service in preserve the peace of the frontier be of a most important nature in all case of emergency the reliance of the country be properly place in the militia of the several states and it may well deserve the consideration of congress whether a new and more perfect organization might not be introduce look mainly to the volunteer company of the union for the present and of easy application to the great body of the militia in time of war
 the expenditure of the war department have be considerably reduce in the last two year contingency however may arise which would call for the filling up of the regiment with a full complement of man and make it very desirable to remount the corp of dragoon which by an act of the last congress be direct to be dissolve
 i refer you to the accompany report of the secretary for information in relation to the navy of the united states while every effort have be and will continue to be make to retrench all superfluity and lop off all excrescence which from time to time may have grow up yet it have not be regard as wise or prudent to recommend any material change in the annual appropriation the interest which be involve be of too important a character to lead to the recommendation of any other than a liberal policy adequate appropriation ought to be make to enable the executive to fit out all the ship that be now in a course of building or that require repair for active service in the short possible time should any emergency arise which may require it an efficient navy while it be the cheap mean of public defense enlist in its support the feeling of pride and confidence which brilliant deed and heroic valor have heretofore serve to strengthen and confirm
 i refer you particularly to that part of the secretary&#39;s report which have reference to recent experiment in the application of steam and in the construction of our war steamer make under the superintendence of distinguished officer of the navy in addition to other manifest improvement in the construction of the steam engine and application of the motive power which have render they more appropriate to the use of ship of war one of those officer have bring into use a power which make the steamship most formidable either for attack or defense i can not too strongly recommend this subject to your consideration and do not hesitate to express my entire conviction of its great importance
 i call your particular attention also to that portion of the secretary&#39;s report which have reference to the act of the late session of congress which prohibit the transfer of any balance of appropriation from other head of appropriation to that for building equipment and repair the repeal of that prohibition will enable the department to give renew employment to a large class of workman who have be necessarily discharge in consequence of the want of mean to pay they a circumstance attend especially at this season of the year with much privation and suffering
 it give i great pain to announce to you the loss of the steamship the missouri by fire in the bay of gibraltar where she have stop to renew her supply of coal on her voyage to alexandria with mr. cushing the american minister to china on board there be ground for high commendation of the officer and man for the coolness and intrepidity and perfect submission to discipline evince under the most try circumstance surround by a rage fire which the utmost exertion could not subdue and which threaten momentarily the explosion of her well supply magazine the officer exhibit no sign of fear and the man obey every order with alacrity nor be she abandon until the last gleam of hope of save she have expire it be well worthy of your consideration whether the loss sustain by the officer and crew in this unfortunate affair should not be reimburse to they
 i can not take leave of this painful subject without advert to the aid render upon the occasion by the british authority at gibraltar and the commander officer and crew of the british ship of the line the malabar which be lie at the time in the bay everything that generosity or humanity could dictate be promptly perform it be by such act of good will by one to another of the family of nation that fraternal feeling be nourish and the blessing of permanent peace secure
 the report of the postmaster general will bring you acquainted with the operation of that department during the past year and will suggest to you such modification of the exist law as in your opinion the exigency of the public service may require the change which the country have undergo of late year in the mode of travel and transportation have afford so many facility for the transmission of mail matter out of the regular mail as to require the great vigilance and circumspection in order to enable the officer at the head of the department to restrain the expenditure within the income there be also too much reason to fear that the franking privilege have run into great abuse the department nevertheless have be conduct with the great vigor and have attain at the least possible expense all the useful object for which it be establish
 in regard to all the departments i be quite happy in the belief that nothing have be leave undo which be call for by a true spirit of economy or by a system of accountability rigidly enforce this be in some degree apparent from the fact that the government have sustain no loss by the default of any of its agent in the complex but at the same time beautiful machinery of our system of government it be not a matter of surprise that some remote agency may have fail for an instant to fulfill its desire office but i feel confident in the assertion that nothing have occur to interrupt the harmonious action of the government itself and that while the law have be execute with efficiency and vigor the right neither of states nor individual have be trample on or disregarded
 in the meantime the country have be steadily advance in all that contribute to national greatness the tide of population continue unbrokenly to flow into the new states and territories where a refuge be find not only for our native bear fellow citizen but for emigrant from all part of the civilized world who come among we to partake of the blessing of our free institution and to aid by their labor to swell the current of our wealth and power
 it be due to every consideration of public policy that the lake and river of the west should receive all such attention at the hand of congress as the constitution will enable it to bestow work in favorable and proper situation on the lakes would be find to be as indispensably necessary in case of war to carry on safe and successful naval operation as fortification on the atlantic seaboard the appropriation make by the last congress for the improvement of the navigation of the mississippi river have be diligently and efficiently apply

 in this condition of thing i have feel it to be my duty to bring to your favorable consideration matter of great interest in their present and ultimate result and the only desire which i feel in connection with the future be and will continue to be to leave the country prosperous and its institution unimpaire

to the house of representatives
 in compliance with a resolution of the house of representatives of the 23d of march last request the president to lay before the house the authority and the true copy of all request and application upon which he deem it his duty to interfere with the naval and military force of the united states on the occasion of the recent attempt of the people of rhode island to establish a free constitution in the place of the old charter government of that state also copy of the instruction to and statement of the charter commissioner send to he by the then exist authority of the state of rhode island also copy of the correspondence between the executive of the united states and the charter government of the state of rhode island and all the paper and document connect with the same also copy of the correspondence if any between the head of departments and say charter government or any person or person connect with the said government and of any accompanying paper and document also copy of all order issue by the executive of the united states or any of the departments to military officer for the movement or employment of troop to or in rhode island also copy of all order to naval officer to prepare steam or other vessel of the united states for service in the water of rhode island also copy of all order to the officer of revenue cutter for the same service also copy of any instruction bear by the secretary of war to rhode island on his visit in 1842 to review the troop of the charter government also copy of any order or order to any officer or officer of the army or navy to report themselves to the charter government and that he be request to lay before this house copy of any other paper or document in the possession of the executive connect with this subject not above specifically enumerate i have to inform the house that the executive do not deem it his duty to interfere with the naval and military force of the united states in the late disturbance in rhode island that no order be issue by the executive or any of the departments to military officer for the movement or employment of troop to or in rhode island other than those which accompany this message and which contemplate the strengthening of the garrison at fort adams which consider the extent of the agitation in rhode island be esteem necessary and judicious that no order be issue to naval officer to prepare steam or other vessel of the united states for service in the water of rhode island that no order be issue to the officer of the revenue cutter for said service that no instruction be bear by the secretary of war to rhode island on his visit in 1842 to review the troop of the charter government that no order be give to any officer or officer of the army or navy to report themselves to the charter government that request and application be make to the executive to fulfill the guaranty of the constitution which impose on the federal government the obligation to protect and defend each state of the union against domestic violence and foreign invasion but the executive be at no time convince that the casus faederis have arise which require the interposition of the military or naval power in the controversy which unhappily exist between the people of rhode island i be in no manner prevent from so interfere by the inquiry whether rhode island exist as an independent state of the union under a charter grant at an early period by the crown of great britain or not it be enough for the executive to know that she be recognize as a sovereign state by great britain by the treaty of 1783 that at a late day she have in common with her sister states pour out her blood and freely expend her treasure in the war of the revolution that she be a party to the articles of confederation that at an after period she adopt the constitution of the united states as a free independent and republican state and that in this character she have always possess her full quota of representation in the senate and house of representatives and that up to a recent day she have conduct all her domestic affair and fulfil all her obligation as a member of the union in peace and war under her charter government as it be denominate by the resolution of the house of the 23d march i must be permit to disclaim entirely and unqualifiedly the right on the part of the executive to make any real or suppose defect exist in any state constitution or form of government the pretext for a failure to enforce the law or the guaranty of the constitution of the united states in reference to any such state i utterly repudiate the idea in term as emphatic as i can employ that those law be not to be enforce or those guaranty comply with because the president may believe that the right of suffrage or any other great popular right be either too restricted or too broadly enlarged i also with equal strength resist the idea that it fail within the executive competency to decide in controversy of the nature of that which exist in rhode island on which side be the majority of the people or as to the extent of the right of a mere numerical majority for the executive to assume such a power would be to assume a power of the most dangerous character under such assumption the states of this union would have no security for peace or tranquillity but might be convert into the mere instrument of executive will actuate by selfish purpose he might become the great agitator foment assault upon the state constitution and declare the majority of to day to be the minority of to morrow and the minority in its turn the majority before whose decree the establish order of thing in the state should be subvert revolution civil commotion and bloodshed would be the inevitable consequence the provision in the constitution intend for the security of the states would thus be turn into the instrument of their destruction the president would become in fact the great constitution maker for the states and all power would be vest in his hand
 when therefore the governor of rhode island by his letter of the 4th of april 1842 make a requisition upon the executive for aid to put down the late disturbance i have no hesitation in recognize the obligation of the executive to furnish such aid upon the occurrence of the contingency provide for by the constitution and law my letter of the 11th of april in reply to the governor&#39;s letter of the 4th be herewith communicate together with all correspondence which pass at a subsequent day and the letter and document mention in the schedule hereunto annexed from the correspondence between the executive of the united states and that of rhode island it will not escape observation that while i regard it as my duty to announce the principle by which i should govern myself in the contingency of an armed interposition on the part of this government be necessary to uphold the right of the state of rhode island and to preserve its domestic peace yet that the strong hope be indulge and express that all the difficulty would disappear before an enlightened policy of conciliation and compromise in that spirit i address to governor king the letter of the 9th of may 1842 mark private and confidential and receive his reply of the 12th of may of the same year the desire of the executive be from the beginning to bring the dispute to a termination without the interposition of the military power of the united states and it will continue to be a subject of self congratulation that this lead object of policy be finally accomplish the executive resist all entreaty however urgent to depart from this line of conduct information from private source have lead the executive to conclude that little else be design by mr. dorr and his adherent than mere menace with a view to intimidation nor be this opinion in any degree shake until the 22d of june 1842 when it be strongly represent from reliable source as will be see by reference to the document herewith communicate that preparation be make by mr. dorr with a large force in arm to invade the state which force have be recruit in the neighboring states and have be already precede by the collection of military store in considerable quantity at one or two point this be a state of thing to which the executive could not be indifferent mr. dorr speedily afterwards take up his headquarters at chepachet and assume the command of what be report to be a large force draw chiefly from voluntary enlistment make in neighboring state the executive could with difficulty bring itself to realize the fact that the citizen of other states should have forget their duty to themselves and the constitution of the united states and have enter into the highly reprehensible and indefensible course of interfere so far in the concern of a sister state as to have enter into plan of invasion conquest and revolution but the executive feel it to be its duty to look minutely into the matter and therefore the secretary of war be dispatch to rhode island with instruction a copy of which be herewith transmit and be authorize should a requisition be make upon the executive by the government of rhode island in pursuance of law and the invader should not abandon their purpose to call upon the governor of massachusetts and connecticut for a sufficient number of militia at once to arrest the invasion and to interpose such of the regular troop as could be spare from fort adams for the defense of the city of providence in the event of its being attack as be strongly represent to be in contemplation happily there be no necessity for either issue the proclamation or the requisition or for remove the troop from fort adams where they have be properly station chepachet be evacuate and mr. dorr&#39;s troop disperse without the necessity of the interposition of any military force by this government thus confirm i in my early impression that nothing more have be design from the first by those associate with mr. dorr than to excite fear and apprehension and thereby to obtain concession from the constituted authority which might be claim as a triumph over the exist government
 with the dispersion of mr. dorr&#39;s troop end all difficulty a convention be shortly afterwards call by due course of law to amend the fundamental law and a new constitution base on more liberal principle than that abrogate be propose and adopt by the people thus the great american experiment of a change in government under the influence of opinion and not of force have be again crown with success and the state and people of rhode island repose in safety under institution of their own adoption unterrifie by any future prospect of necessary change and secure against domestic violence and invasion from abroad i congratulate the country upon so happy a termination of a condition of thing which seem at one time seriously to threaten the public peace it may justly be regard as worthy of the age and of the country in which we live

to the house of representatives of the united states
 i return to the house of representatives in which it originate the bill entitle an act make appropriation for the improvement of certain harbor and river with the following objection to its become a law
 at the adoption of the constitution each state be possess of a separate and independent sovereignty and an exclusive jurisdiction over all stream and water course within its territorial limit the articles of confederation in no way affect this authority or jurisdiction and the present constitution adopt for the purpose of correct the defect which exist in the original articles expressly reserve to the states all power not delegate no such surrender of jurisdiction be make by the states to this government by any express grant and if it be possess it be to be deduce from the clause in the constitution which invest congress with authority to make all law which be necessary and proper for carry into execution the grant power there be in my view of the subject no pretense whatever for the claim to power which the bill now return substantially set up the inferential power in order to be legitimate must be clearly and plainly incidental to some grant power and necessary to its exercise to refer it to the head of convenience or usefulness would be to throw open the door to a boundless and unlimited discretion and to invest congress with an unrestrained authority the power to remove obstruction from the water course of the states be claim under the grant power to regulate commerce with foreign nation among the several states and with the indian tribe but the plain and obvious meaning of this grant be that congress may adopt rule and regulation prescribe the term and condition on which the citizen of the united states may carry on commercial operation with foreign state or kingdom and on which the citizen or subject of foreign state or kingdom may prosecute trade with the united states or either of they and so the power to regulate commerce among the several states no more invest congress with jurisdiction over the water course of the states than the first branch of the grant do over the water course of foreign power which would be an absurdity
 the right of common use of the people of the united states to the navigable water of each and every state arise from the express stipulation contain in the constitution that the citizen of each state shall be entitle to all privilege and immunity of citizen in the several states while therefore the navigation of any river in any state be by the law of such state allow to the citizen thereof the same be also secure by the constitution of the united states on the same term and condition to the citizen of every other state and so of any other privilege or immunity
 the application of the revenue of this government if the power to do so be admit to improve the navigation of the river by remove obstruction or otherwise would be for the most part productive only of local benefit the consequence might prove disastrously ruinous to as many of our fellow citizen as the exercise of such power would benefit i will take one instance furnish by the present bill out of no invidious feeling for such it would be impossible for i to feel but because of my great familiarity with location in illustration of the above opinion twenty thousand dollar be propose to be appropriate toward improve the harbor of richmond in the state of virginia such improvement would furnish advantage to the city of richmond and add to the value of the property of its citizen while it might have a most disastrous influence over the wealth and prosperity of petersburg which be situate some 25 mile distant on a branch of james river and which now enjoy its fair portion of the trade so too the improvement of james river to richmond and of the appomattox to petersburg might by invite the trade to those two town have the effect of prostrate the town of norfolk this too might be accomplish without add a single vessel to the number now engage in the trade of the chesapeake bay or bring into the treasury a dollar of additional revenue it would produce most probably the single effect of concentrate the commerce now profitably enjoy by three place upon one of they this case furnish an apt illustration of the effect of this bill in several other particular
 there can not in fact be draw the slight discrimination between the improve the stream of a state under the power to regulate commerce and the most extended system of internal improvement on land the excavate a canal and pave a road be equally as much incident to such claim of power as the remove obstruction from water course nor can such power be restrict by any fair course of reasoning to the mere fact of make the improvement it reasonably extend also to the right of seek a return of the mean expend through the exaction of toll and the levying of contribution thus while the constitution deny to this government the privilege of acquire a property in the soil of any state even for the purpose of erect a necessary fortification without a grant from such state this claim to power would invest it with control and dominion over the water and soil of each state without restriction power so incongruous can not exist in the same instrument
 the bill be also liable to a serious objection because of its blend appropriation for numerous object but few of which agree in their general feature this necessarily produce the effect of embarrass executive action some of the appropriation would receive my sanction if separate from the rest however much i might deplore the reproduction of a system which for some time past have be permit to sleep with apparently the acquiescence of the country i might particularize the delaware breakwater as an improvement which look to the security from the storm of our extend atlantic seaboard of the vessel of all the country engage either in the foreign or the coastwise trade as well as to the safety of the revenue but when in connection with that the same bill embrace improvement of river at point far in the interior connect alone with the trade of such river and the exertion of mere local influence no alternative be leave i but to use the qualified veto with which the executive be invest by the constitution and to return the bill to the house in which it originate for its ultimate reconsideration and decision
 in sanction a bill of the same title with that return for the improvement of the mississippi and its chief tributary and certain harbor on the lakes if i bring myself apparently in conflict with any of the principle herein assert it will arise on my part exclusively from the want of a just appreciation of locality the mississippi occupy a footing altogether different from the river and water course of the different states no one state or any number of states can exercise any other jurisdiction over it than for the punishment of crime and the service of civil process it belong to no particular state or states but of common right by express reservation to all the states it be reserve as a great common highway for the commerce of the whole country to have concede to louisiana or to any other state admit as a new state into the union the exclusive jurisdiction and consequently the right to make improvement and to levy toll on the segment of the river embrace within its territorial limit would have be to have disappoint the chief object in the purchase of louisiana which be to secure the free use of the mississippi to all the people of the united states whether levy on commerce be make by a foreign or domestic government would have be equally burdensome and objectionable the united states therefore be charge with its improvement for the benefit of all and the appropriation of governmental mean to its improvement become indispensably necessary for the good of all
 as to the harbor on the lakes the act originate no new improvement but make appropriation for the continuance of work already begin
 it be as much the duty of the government to construct good harbor without reference to the location or interest of city for the shelter of the extensive commerce of the lakes as to build breakwater on the atlantic coast for the protection of the trade of that ocean these great inland sea be visit by destructive storm and the annual loss of ship and cargo and consequently of revenue to the government be immense if then there be any work embrace by that act which be not require in order to afford shelter and security to the shipping against the tempest which so often sweep over those great inland sea but have on the contrary originate more in a spirit of speculation and local interest than in one of the character allude to the house of representatives will regard my approval of the bill more as the result of misinformation than any design to abandon or modify the principle lay down in this message every system be liable to run into abuse and none more so than that under consideration and measure can not be too soon take by congress to guard against this evil

to the senate and house of representatives of the united states
 we have continue cause for express our gratitude to the supreme ruler of the universe for the benefit and blessing which our country under his kind providence have enjoy during the past year notwithstanding the exciting scene through which we have pass nothing have occur to disturb the general peace or to derange the harmony of our political system the great moral spectacle have be exhibit of a nation approximate in number to 20,000,000 people having perform the high and important function of elect their chief magistrate for the term of four year without the commission of any act of violence or the manifestation of a spirit of insubordination to the law the great and inestimable right of suffrage have be exercise by all who be invest with it under the law of the different states in a spirit dictate alone by a desire in the selection of the agent to advance the interest of the country and to place beyond jeopardy the institution under which it be our happiness to live that the deep interest have be manifest by all our countryman in the result of the election be not less true than highly creditable to they vast multitude have assemble from time to time at various place for the purpose of canvass the merit and pretension of those who be present for their suffrage but no armed soldiery have be necessary to restrain within proper limit the popular zeal or to prevent violent outbreak a principle much more control be find in the love of order and obedience to the law which with mere individual exception everywhere possess the american mind and control with an influence far more powerful than host of armed man we can not dwell upon this picture without recognize in it that deep and devoted attachment on the part of the people to the institution under which we live which proclaim their perpetuity the great objection which have always prevail against the election by the people of their chief executive officer have be the apprehension of tumult and disorder which might involve in ruin the entire government a security against this be find not only in the fact before allude to but in the additional fact that we live under a confederacy embrace already twenty six states no one of which have power to control the election the popular vote in each state be take at the time appoint by the law and such vote be announce by the electoral college without reference to the decision of other states the right of suffrage and the mode of conduct the election be regulate by the law of each state and the election be distinctly federative in all its prominent feature thus it be that unlike what might be the result under a consolidated system riotous proceeding should they prevail could only affect the election in single states without disturb to any dangerous extent the tranquillity of other the great experiment of a political confederation each member of which be supreme as to all matter appertain to its local interest and its internal peace and happiness while by a voluntary compact with other it confide to the united power of all the protection of its citizen in matter not domestic have be so far crown with complete success the world have witness its rapid growth in wealth and population and under the guide and direction of a superintend providence the development of the past may be regard but as the shadow forth of the mighty future in the bright prospect of that future we shall find as patriot and philanthropist the high inducement to cultivate and cherish a love of union and to frown down every measure or effort which may be make to alienate the states or the people of the states in sentiment and feel from each other a rigid and close adherence to the term of our political compact and above all a sacred observance of the guaranty of the constitution will preserve union on a foundation which can not be shake while personal liberty be place beyond hazard or jeopardy the guaranty of religious freedom of the freedom of the press of the liberty of speech of the trial by jury of the habeas corpus and of the domestic institution of each of the states leave the private citizen in the full exercise of the high and ennoble attribute of his nature and to each state the privilege which can only be judiciously exert by itself of consult the mean well calculate to advance its own happiness these be the great and important guaranty of the constitution which the lover of liberty must cherish and the advocate of union must ever cultivate preserve these and avoid all interpolation by force construction under the guise of an imagine expediency upon the constitution the influence of our political system be destine to be as actively and as beneficially feel on the distant shore of the pacific as it be now on those of the atlantic ocean the only formidable impediment in the way of its successful expansion time and space be so far in the progress of modification by the improvement of the age as to render no long speculative the ability of representative from that remote region to come up to the capitol so that their constituent shall participate in all the benefit of federal legislation thus it be that in the progress of time the inestimable principle of civil liberty will be enjoy by million yet unborn and the great benefit of our system of government be extend to now distant and uninhabited region in view of the vast wilderness yet to be reclaim we may well invite the lover of freedom of every land to take up his abode among we and assist we in the great work of advance the standard of civilization and give a wide spread to the art and refinement of cultivate life our prayer should evermore be offer up to the father of the universe for his wisdom to direct we in the path of our duty so as to enable we to consummate these high purpose
 one of the strong objection which have be urge against confederacy by writer on government be the liability of the member to be tamper with by foreign government or the people of foreign state either in their local affair or in such as affect the peace of other or endanger the safety of the whole confederacy we can not hope to be entirely exempt from such attempt on our peace and safety the united states be become too important in population and resource not to attract the observation of other nation it therefore may in the progress of time occur that opinion entirely abstract in the states which they may prevail and in no degree affect their domestic institution may be artfully but secretly encourage with a view to undermine the union such opinion may become the foundation of political party until at last the conflict of opinion produce an alienation of friendly feeling among the people of the different states may involve in general destruction the happy institution under which we live it should ever be bear in mind that what be true in regard to individual be equally so in regard to state an interference of one in the affair of another be the fruitful cause of family dissension and neighborhood dispute and the same cause affect the peace happiness and prosperity of state it may be most devoutly hope that the good sense of the american people will ever be ready to repel all such attempt should they ever be make
 there have be no material change in our foreign relation since my last annual message to congress with all the power of europe we continue on the most friendly term indeed it afford i much satisfaction to state that at no former period have the peace of that enlightened and important quarter of the globe ever be apparently more firmly establish the conviction that peace be the true policy of nation would seem to be grow and become deep amongst the enlightened everywhere and there be no people who have a strong interest in cherish the sentiment and adopt the mean of preserve and give it permanence than those of the united states amongst these the first and most effective be no doubt the strict observance of justice and the honest and punctual fulfillment of all engagement but it be not to be forget that in the present state of the world it be no less necessary to be ready to enforce their observance and fulfillment in reference to ourselves than to observe and fulfill they on our part in regard to other

 our late minister to chili mr. pendleton have return to the united states without having effect an adjustment in the second claim of the macedonian which be delay on ground altogether frivolous and untenable mr. pendleton&#39;s successor have be direct to urge the claim in the strong term and in the event of a failure to obtain a prompt adjustment to report the fact to the executive at as early a day as possible so that the whole matter may be communicate to congress

 in my last annual message i feel it to be my duty to make know to congress in term both plain and emphatic my opinion in regard to the war which have so long exist between mexico and texas which since the battle of san jacinto have consist altogether of predatory incursion attend by circumstance revolt to humanity i repeat now what i then say that after eight year of feeble and ineffectual effort to reconquer texas it be time that the war should have cease the united states have a direct interest in the question the contiguity of the two nation to our territory be but too well calculate to involve our peace unjust suspicion be engender in the mind of one or the other of the belligerent against we and as a necessary consequence american interest be make to suffer and our peace become daily endanger in addition to which it must have be obvious to all that the exhaustion produce by the war subject both mexico and texas to the interference of other power which without the interposition of this government might eventuate in the most serious injury to the united states this government from time to time exert its friendly office to bring about a termination of hostility upon term honorable alike to both the belligerent its effort in this behalf prove unavaile mexico seem almost without an object to persevere in the war and no other alternative be leave the executive but to take advantage of the well know disposition of texas and to invite she to enter into a treaty for annex her territory to that of the united states
 since your last session mexico have threaten to renew the war and have either make or propose to make formidable preparation for invade texas she have issue decree and proclamation preparatory to the commencement of hostility full of threat revolt to humanity and which if carry into effect would arouse the attention of all christendom this new demonstration of feeling there be too much reason to believe have be produce in consequence of the negotiation of the late treaty of annexation with texas the executive therefore could not be indifferent to such proceeding and it feel it to be due as well to itself as to the honor of the country that a strong representation should be make to the mexican government upon the subject this be accordingly do as will be see by the copy of the accompany dispatch from the secretary of state to the united states envoy at mexico mexico have no right to jeopard the peace of the world by urge any long a useless and fruitless contest such a condition of thing would not be tolerate on the european continent why should it be on this a war of desolation such as be now threaten by mexico can not be wage without involve our peace and tranquillity it be idle to believe that such a war could be look upon with indifference by our own citizen inhabit adjoining state and our neutrality would be violate in despite of all effort on the part of the government to prevent it the country be settle by emigrant from the united states under invitation hold out to they by spain and mexico those emigrant have leave behind they friend and relative who would not fail to sympathize with they in their difficulty and who would be lead by those sympathy to participate in their struggle however energetic the action of the government to prevent it nor would the numerous and formidable band of indians the most warlike to be find in any land which occupy the extensive region contiguous to the states of arkansas and missouri and who be in possession of large tract of country within the limit of texas be likely to remain passive the inclination of those numerous tribe lead they invariably to war whenever pretexts exist
 mexico have no just ground of displeasure against this government or people for negotiate the treaty what interest of hers be affect by the treaty she be despoiled of nothing since texas be forever lose to she the independence of texas be recognize by several of the lead power of the earth she be free to treat free to adopt her own line of policy free to take the course which she believe be well calculate to secure her happiness
 her government and people decide on annexation to the united states and the executive see in the acquisition of such a territory the mean of advance their permanent happiness and glory what principle of good faith then be violate what rule of political moral trample under foot so far as mexico herself be concern the measure should have be regard by she as highly beneficial her inability to reconquer texas have be exhibit i repeat by eight now nine year of fruitless and ruinous contest in the meantime texas have be grow in population and resource emigration have flow into her territory from all part of the world in a current which continue to increase in strength mexico require a permanent boundary between that young republic and herself texas at no distant day if she continue separate and detach from the united states will inevitably seek to consolidate her strength by add to her domain the contiguous provinces of mexico the spirit of revolt from the control of the central government have heretofore manifest itself in some of those provinces and it be fair to infer that they would be incline to take the first favorable opportunity to proclaim their independence and to form close alliance with texas the war would thus be endless or if cessation of hostility should occur they would only endure for a season the interest of mexico therefore could in nothing be well consult than in a peace with her neighbor which would result in the establishment of a permanent boundary upon the ratification of the treaty the executive be prepared to treat with she on the most liberal basis hence the boundary of texas be leave undefined by the treaty the executive propose to settle these upon term that all the world should have pronounce just and reasonable no negotiation upon that point could have be undertake between the united states and mexico in advance of the ratification of the treaty we should have have no right no power no authority to have conduct such a negotiation and to have undertake it would have be an assumption equally revolt to the pride of mexico and texas and subject we to the charge of arrogance while to have propose in advance of annexation to satisfy mexico for any contingent interest she might have in texas would have be to have treat texas not as an independent power but as a mere dependency of mexico this assumption could not have be act on by the executive without set at defiance your own solemn declaration that that republic be an independent state mexico have it be true threaten war against the united states in the event the treaty of annexation be ratify the executive could not permit itself to be influence by this threat it represent in this the spirit of our people who be ready to sacrifice much for peace but nothing to intimidation a war under any circumstance be greatly to be deplore and the united states be the last nation to desire it but if as the condition of peace it be require of we to forego the unquestionable right of treat with an independent power of our own continent upon matter highly interesting to both and that upon a naked and unsustained pretension of claim by a third power to control the free will of the power with whom we treat devote as we may be to peace and anxious to cultivate friendly relation with the whole world the executive do not hesitate to say that the people of the united states would be ready to brave all consequence soon than submit to such condition but no apprehension of war be entertain by the executive and i must express frankly the opinion that have the treaty be ratify by the senate it would have be follow by a prompt settlement to the entire satisfaction of mexico of every matter in difference between the two country see then that new preparation for hostile invasion of texas be about to be adopt by mexico and that these be bring about because texas have adopt the suggestion of the executive upon the subject of annexation it could not passively have fold its arm and permit a war threaten to be accompany by every act that could mark a barbarous age to be wage against she because she have do so
 other consideration of a control character influence the course of the executive the treaty which have thus be negotiate have fail to receive the ratification of the senate one of the chief objection which be urge against it be find to consist in the fact that the question of annexation have not be submit to the ordeal of public opinion in the united states however untenable such an objection be esteem to be in view of the unquestionable power of the executive to negotiate the treaty and the great and lasting interest involve in the question i feel it to be my duty to submit the whole subject to congress as the good expounder of popular sentiment no definitive action having be take on the subject by congress the question refer itself directly to the decision of the states and people the great popular election which have just terminate afford the good opportunity of ascertain the will of the states and the people upon it pende that issue it become the imperative duty of the executive to inform mexico that the question of annexation be still before the american people and that until their decision be pronounce any serious invasion of texas would be regard as an attempt to forestall their judgment and could not be look upon with indifference i be most happy to inform you that no such invasion have take place and i trust that whatever your action may be upon it mexico will see the importance of decide the matter by a resort to peaceful expedient in preference to those of arm the decision of the people and the states on this great and interesting subject have be decisively manifest the question of annexation have be present nakedly to their consideration by the treaty itself all collateral and incidental issue which be calculate to divide and distract the public council be carefully avoid these be leave to the wisdom of the future to determine it present i repeat the isolated question of annexation and in that form it have be submit to the ordeal of public sentiment a control majority of the people and a large majority of the states have declare in favor of immediate annexation instruction have thus come up to both branch of congress from their respective constituent in term the most emphatic it be the will of both the people and the states that texas shall be annex to the union promptly and immediately it may be hope that in carry into execution the public will thus declare all collateral issue may be avoid future legislatures can well decide as to the number of states which should be form out of the territory when the time have arrive for decide that question so with all other by the treaty the united states assume the payment of the debt of texas to an amount not exceed $ 10,000,000 to be pay with the exception of a sum fall short of $ 400,000 exclusively out of the proceed of the sale of her public land we could not with honor take the land without assume the full payment of all incumbency upon they
 nothing have occur since your last session to induce a doubt that the disposition of texas remain unaltered no intimation of an altered determination on the part of her government and people have be furnish to the executive she still desire to throw herself under the protection of our law and to partake of the blessing of our federative system while every american interest would seem to require it the extension of our coastwise and foreign trade to an amount almost incalculable the enlargement of the market for our manufacture a constantly grow market for our agricultural production safety to our frontier and additional strength and stability to the union these be the result which would rapidly develop themselves upon the consummation of the measure of annexation in such event i will not doubt but that mexico would find her true interest to consist in meet the advance of this government in a spirit of amity nor do i apprehend any serious complaint from any other quarter no sufficient ground exist for such complaint we should interfere in no respect with the right of any other nation there can not be gather from the act any design on our part to do so with their possession on this continent we have interpose no impediment in the way of such acquisition of territory large and extensive as many of they be as the lead power of europe have make from time to time in every part of the world we seek no conquest make by war no intrigue will have be resort to or act of diplomacy essay to accomplish the annexation of texas free and independent herself she ask to be receive into our union it be a question for our own decision whether she shall be receive or not
 the two government having already agree through their respective organ on the term of annexation i would recommend their adoption by congress in the form of a joint resolution or act to be perfect and make bind on the two country when adopt in like manner by the government of texas
 in order that the subject may be fully present in all its bearing the correspondence which have take place in reference to it since the adjournment of congress between the united states texas and mexico be herewith transmit
 the amendment propose by the senate to the convention conclude between the united states and mexico on the 20th of november 1843 have be transmit through our minister for the concurrence of the mexican government but although urge thereto no action have yet be have on the subject nor have any answer be give which would authorize a favorable conclusion in the future
 the decree of september 1843 in relation to the retail trade the order for the expulsion of foreigner and that of a more recent date in regard to passport all which be consider as in violation of the treaty of amity and commerce between the two country have lead to a correspondence of considerable length between the minister for foreign relation and our representative at mexico but without any satisfactory result they remain still unadjusted and many and serious inconvenience have already result to our citizen in consequence of they
 question grow out of the act of disarm a body of texan troop under the command of major snively by an officer in the service of the united states act under the order of our government and the forcible entry into the custom house at bryarlys landing on red river by certain citizen of the united states and take away therefrom the good seize by the collector of the custom as forfeit under the law of texas have be adjust so far as the power of the executive extend the correspondence between the two government in reference to both subject will be find amongst the accompany document it contain a full statement of all the fact and circumstance with the view take on both side and the principle on which the question have be adjust it remain for congress to make the necessary appropriation to carry the arrangement into effect which i respectfully recommend
 the greatly improve condition of the treasury afford a subject for general congratulation the paralysis which have fall on trade and commerce and which subject the government to the necessity of resort to loan and the issue of treasury note to a large amount have pass away and after the payment of upward of $ 7,000,000 on account of the interest and in redemption of more than $ 5,000,000 of the public debt which fall due on the 1st of january next and set apart upward of $ 2,000,000 for the payment of outstanding treasury note and meet an installment of the debt of the corporate city of the district of columbia an estimate surplus of upward of $ 7,000,000 over and above the exist appropriation will remain in the treasury at the close of the fiscal year should the treasury note continue outstanding as heretofore that surplus will be considerably augment although all interest have cease upon they and the government have invite their return to the treasury yet they remain outstanding afford great facility to commerce and establish the fact that under a well regulate system of finance the government have resource within itself which render it independent in time of need not only of private loan but also of bank facility
 the only remain subject of regret be that the remain stock of the government do not fall due at an early day since their redemption would be entirely within its control as it be it may be well worthy the consideration of congress whether the law establish the sink fund under the operation of which the debt of the revolution and last war with great britain be to a great extent extinguish should not with proper modification so as to prevent an accumulation of surplus and limit in amount to a specific sum be reenact such provision which would authorize the government to go into the market for a purchase of its own stock on fair term would serve to maintain its credit at the high point and prevent to a great extent those fluctuation in the price of its security which might under other circumstance affect its credit no apprehension of this sort be at this moment entertain since the stock of the government which but two year ago be offer for sale to capitalist at home and abroad at a depreciation and could find no purchaser be now greatly above par in the hand of the holder but a wise and prudent forecast admonish we to place beyond the reach of contingency the public credit
 it must also be a matter of unmingled gratification that under the exist financial system rest upon the act of 1789 and the resolution of 1816 the currency of the country have attain a state of perfect soundness and the rate of exchange between different part of the union which in 1841 denote by their enormous amount the great depreciation and in fact worthlessness of the currency in most of the states be now reduce to little more than the mere expense of transport specie from place to place and the risk incident to the operation in a new country like that of the united states where so many inducement be hold out for speculation the depository of the surplus revenue consist of bank of any description when it reach any considerable amount require the close vigilance on the part of the government all banking institution under whatever denomination they may pass be govern by an almost exclusive regard to the interest of the stockholder that interest consist in the augmentation of profit in the form of dividend and a large surplus revenue intrust to their custody be but too apt to lead to excessive loan and to extravagantly large issue of paper as a necessary consequence price be nominally increase and the speculative mania very soon seize upon the public mind a fictitious state of prosperity for a season exist and in the language of the day money become plenty contract be enter into by individual rest on this unsubstantial state of thing but the delusion speedily pass away and the country be overrun with an indebtedness so weighty as to overwhelm many and to visit every department of industry with great and ruinous embarrassment the great vigilance become necessary on the part of government to guard against this state of thing the depository must be give distinctly to understand that the favor of the government will be altogether withdraw or substantially diminish if its revenue shall be regard as addition to their banking capital or as the foundation of an enlarged circulation
 the government through its revenue have at all time an important part to perform in connection with the currency and it greatly depend upon its vigilance and care whether the country be involve in embarrassment similar to those which it have have recently to encounter or aid by the action of the treasury shall be preserve in a sound and healthy condition
 the danger to be guard against be greatly augment by too large a surplus of revenue when that surplus greatly exceed in amount what shall be require by a wise and prudent forecast to meet unforeseen contingency the legislature itself may come to be seize with a disposition to indulge in extravagant appropriation to object many of which may and most probably would be find to conflict with the constitution a fancied expediency be elevate above constitutional authority and a reckless and wasteful extravagance but too certainly follow
 the important power of taxation which when exercise in its most restrict form be a burthen on labor and production be resort to under various pretext for purpose have no affinity to the motive which dictate its grant and the extravagance of government stimulate individual extravagance until the spirit of a wild and ill regulate speculation involve one and all in its unfortunate result in view of such fatal consequence it may be lay down as an axiom round in moral and political truth that no great taxis should be impose than be necessary for an economical administration of the government and that whatever exist beyond should be reduce or modify this doctrine do in no way conflict with the exercise of a sound discrimination in the selection of the article to be tax which a due regard to the public weal would at all time suggest to the legislative mind it leave the range of selection undefine and such selection should always be make with an eye to the great interest of the country compose as be the union of separate and independent states a patriotic legislature will not fail in consult the interest of the part to adopt such course as will be well calculate to advance the harmony of the whole and thus insure that permanency in the policy of the government without which all effort to advance the public prosperity be vain and fruitless
 this great and vitally important task rest with congress and the executive can do no more than recommend the general principle which should govern in its execution
 i refer you to the report of the secretary of war for an exhibition of the condition of the army and recommend to you as well worthy your good consideration many of the suggestion it contain the secretary in no degree exaggerate the great importance of press forward without delay in the work of erect and finish the fortification to which he particularly allude much have be do toward place our city and roadstead in a state of security against the hazard of hostile attack within the last four year but consider the new element which have be of late year employ in the propelling of ship and the formidable implement of destruction which have be bring into service we can not be too active or vigilant in prepare and perfect the mean of defense i refer you also to his report for a full statement of the condition of the indian tribe within our jurisdiction the executive have abate no effort in carry into effect the well establish policy of the government which contemplate a removal of all the tribe reside within the limit of the several states beyond those limit and it be now enable to congratulate the country at the prospect of an early consummation of this object many of the tribe have already make great progress in the art of civilized life and through the operation of the school establish among they aid by the effort of the pious man of various religious denomination who devote themselves to the task of their improvement we may fondly hope that the remain of the formidable tribe which be once master of this country will in their transition from the savage state to a condition of refinement and cultivation add another bright trophy to adorn the labor of a well direct philanthropy
 the accompanying report of the secretary of the navy will explain to you the situation of that branch of the service the present organization of the department impart to its operation great efficiency but i concur fully in the propriety of a division of the bureau of construction equipment increase and repairs into two bureau the subject as now arrange be incongruous and require to a certain extent information and qualification altogether dissimilar
 the operation of the squadron on the coast of africa have be conduct with all due attention to the object which lead to its origination and i be happy to say that the officer and crew have enjoy the good possible health under the system adopt by the officer in command it be believe that the united states be the only nation which have by its law subject to the punishment of death as pirate those who may be engage in the slave trade a similar enactment on the part of other nation would not fail to be attend by beneficial result
 in consequence of the difficulty which have exist in the way of secure title for the necessary ground operation have not yet be commence toward the establishment of the navy yard at memphis so soon as the title be perfect no further delay will be permit to intervene it be well worthy of your consideration whether congress should not direct the establishment of a ropewalk in connection with the contemplated navy yard as a measure not only of economy but as highly useful and necessary the only establishment of the sort now connect with the service be locate at boston and the advantage of a similar establishment convenient to the hemp grow region must be apparent to all

 there be a strong desire manifest in many quarter so to alter the tariff of letter postage as to reduce the amount of tax at present impose should such a measure be carry into effect to the full extent desire it can not well be doubt but that for the first year of its operation a diminished revenue would be collect the supply of which would necessarily constitute a charge upon the treasury whether such a result would be desirable it will be for congress in its wisdom to determine it may in general be assert as true that radical alteration in any system should rather be bring about gradually than by sudden change and by pursue this prudent policy in the reduction of letter postage the department might still sustain itself through the revenue which would accrue by the increase of letter the state and condition of the public treasury have heretofore be such as to have preclude the recommendation of any material change the difficulty upon this head have however cease and a large discretion be now leave to the government
 i can not too strongly urge the policy of authorize the establishment of a line of steamship regularly to ply between this country and foreign port and upon our own water for the transportation of the mail the example of the british government be well worthy of imitation in this respect the belief be strongly entertain that the emolument arise from the transportation of mail matter to foreign country would operate of itself as an inducement to cause individual enterprise to undertake that branch of the task and the remuneration of the government would consist in the addition readily make to our steam navy in case of emergency by the ship so employ should this suggestion meet your approval the propriety of place such ship under the command of experienced officer of the navy will not escape your observation the application of steam to the purpose of naval warfare cogently recommend an extensive steam marine as important in estimate the defense of the country fortunately this may be obtain by we to a great extent without incur any large amount of expenditure steam vessel to be engage in the transportation of the mail on our principal water course lake and port of our coast could also be so construct as to be efficient as war vessel when need and would of themselves constitute a formidable force in order to repel attack from abroad we can not be blind to the fact that other nation have already add large number of steamship to their naval armament and that this new and powerful agent be destine to revolutionize the condition of the world it become the united states therefore look to their security to adopt a similar policy and the plan suggest will enable they to do so at a small comparative cost

to the senate and house of representatives
 i transmit herewith copy of dispatch receive from our minister at mexico since the commencement of your present session which claim from their importance and i doubt not will receive your calm and deliberate consideration the extraordinary and highly offensive language which the mexican government have think proper to employ in reply to the remonstrance of the executive through mr. shannon against the renewal of the war with texas while the question of annexation be pende before congress and the people and also the propose manner of conduct that war will not fail to arrest your attention such remonstrance urge in no unfriendly spirit to mexico be call for by consideration of an imperative character have relation as well to the peace of this country and honor of this government as to the cause of humanity and civilization texas have enter into the treaty of annexation upon the invitation of the executive and when for that act she be threaten with a renewal of the war on the part of mexico she naturally look to this government to interpose its effort to ward off the threaten blow but one course be leave the executive act within the limit of its constitutional competency and that be to pro test in respectful but at the same time strong and decide term against it the war thus threaten to be renew be promulgate by edict and decree which order on the part of the mexican military the desolation of whole tract of country and the destruction without discrimination of all age sex and condition of existence over the manner of conduct war mexico possess no exclusive control she have no right to violate at pleasure the principle which an enlightened civilization have lay down for the conduct of nation at war and thereby retrograde to a period of barbarism which happily for the world have long since pass away all nation be interested in enforce an observance of those principle and the united states the old of the american republics and the near of the civilized power to the theater on which these enormity be propose to be enact could not quietly content themselves to witness such a state of thing they have through the executive on another occasion and as be believe with the approbation of the whole country remonstrate against outrage similar but even less inhuman than those which by her new edict and decree she have threaten to perpetrate and of which the late inhuman massacre at tabasco be but the precursor
 the bloody and inhuman murder of fannin and his companion equal only in savage barbarity by the usage of the untutored indian tribe prove how little confidence could be place on the most solemn stipulation of her general while the fate of other who become her captive in war many of whom no long able to sustain the fatigue and privation of long journey be shoot down by the wayside while their companion who survive be subject to suffering even more painful than death have leave an indelible stain on the page of civilization the executive with the evidence of an intention on the part of mexico to renew scene so revolt to humanity could do no less than renew remonstrance formerly urge for fulfil duty so imperative mexico have think proper through her accredited organ because she have have represent to she the inhumanity of such proceeding to indulge in language unknown to the courtesy of diplomatic intercourse and offensive in the high degree to this government and people nor have she offend in this only she have not only violate exist convention between the two country by arbitrary and unjust decree against our trade and intercourse but withhold installment of debt due to our citizen which she solemnly pledge herself to pay under circumstance which be fully explain by the accompany letter from mr. green our secretary of legation and when our minister have invite the attention of her government to wrong commit by her local authority not only on the property but on the person of our fellow citizen engage in prosecute fair and honest pursuit she have add insult to injury by not even deign for month together to return an answer to his representation still far to manifest her unfriendly feeling toward the united states she have issue decree expel from some of her provinces american citizen engage in the peaceful pursuit of life and now deny to those of our citizen prosecute the whale fishery on the northw coast of the pacific the privilege which have through all time heretofore be accord to they of exchange good of a small amount in value at her port in california for supply indispensable to their health and comfort
 nor will it escape the observation of congress that in conduct a correspondence with a minister of the united states who can not and do not know any distinction between the geographical section of the union charge wholly unfounded be make against particular states and an appeal to other for aid and protection against suppose wrong in this same connection sectional prejudice be attempt to be excite and the hazardous and unpardonable effort be make to foment division amongst the states of the union and thereby imbitter their peace mexico have still to learn that however freely we may indulge in discussion among ourselves the american people will tolerate no interference in their domestic affair by any foreign government and in all that concern the constitutional guaranty and the national honor the people of the united states have but one mind and one heart
 the subject of annexation address itself most fortunately to every portion of the union the executive would have be unmindful of its high obligation if it could have adopt a course of policy dictate by sectional interest and local feeling on the contrary it be because the question be neither local nor sectional but make its appeal to the interest of the whole union and of every state in the union that the negotiation and finally the treaty of annexation be enter into and it have afford i no ordinary pleasure to perceive that so far as demonstration have be make upon it by the people they have proceed from all portion of the union mexico may seek to excite division amongst we by utter unjust denunciation against particular states but when she come to know that the invitation address to our fellow citizen by spain and afterwards by herself to settle texas be accept by emigrant from all the states and when in addition to this she refresh her recollection with the fact that the first effort which be make to acquire texas be during the administration of a distinguished citizen from an eastern state which be afterwards renew under the auspex of a president from the southwest she will awake to a knowledge of the futility of her present purpose of sow dissension among we or produce distraction in our council by attach either on particular states or on person who be now in the retirement of private life
 consider the appeal which she now make to eminent citizen by name can she hope to escape censure for having ascribe to they as well as to other a design as she pretend now for the first time reveal of having originate negotiation to despoil she by duplicity and falsehood of a portion of her territory the opinion then as now prevail with the executive that the annexation of texas to the union be a matter of vast importance in order to acquire that territory before it have assume a position among the independent power of the earth proposition be make to mexico for a cession of it to the united states mexico see in these proceeding at the time no cause of complaint she be now when simply remind of they awaken to the knowledge of the fact which she through her secretary of state promulgate to the whole world as true that those negotiation be found in deception and falsehood and superinduce by unjust and iniquitous motive while texas be a dependency of mexico the united states open negotiation with the latter power for the cession of she then acknowledge territory and now that texas be independent of mexico and have maintain a separate existence for nine year during which time she have be receive into the family of nation and be represent by accredited ambassador at many of the principal courts of europe and when it have become obvious to the whole world that she be forever lose to mexico the united states be charge with deception and falsehood in all relate to the past and condemnatory accusation be make against states which have have no special agency in the matter because the executive of the whole union have negotiate with free and independent texas upon a matter vitally important to the interest of both country and after nine year of unavaile war mexico now announce her intention through her secretary of foreign affair never to consent to the independence of texas or to abandon the effort to reconquer that republic she thus announce a perpetual claim which at the end of a century will furnish she as plausible a ground for discontent against any nation which at the end of that time may enter into a treaty with texas as she possess at this moment against the united states the lapse of time can add nothing to her title to independence
 a course of conduct such as have be describe on the part of mexico in violation of all friendly feeling and of the courtesy which should characterize the intercourse between the nation of the earth might well justify the united states in a resort to any measure to vindicate their national honor but actuate by a sincere desire to preserve the general peace and in view of the present condition of mexico the executive rest upon its integrity and not fear but that the judgment of the world will duly appreciate its motive abstain from recommend to congress a resort to measure of redress and content itself with reurge upon that body prompt and immediate action on the subject of annexation by adopt that measure the united states will be in the exercise of an undoubted right and if mexico not regard their forbearance shall aggravate the injustice of her conduct by a declaration of war against they upon her head will rest all the responsibility

to the senate and house of representatives of the united states
 i transmit herewith for the information of congress copy of certain dispatch recently receive from mr. wise our envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary at the court of brazil upon the subject of the slave trade develop the mean use and the device resort to hi order to evade exist enactment upon that subject
 anxiously desirous as be the united states to suppress a traffic so revolt to humanity in the effort to accomplish which they have be the pioneer of civilized state it can not but be a subject of the most profound regret that any portion of our citizen should be find act in cooperation with the subject of other power in opposition to the policy of their own government thereby subject to suspicion and to the hazard of disgrace the flag of their own country it be true that this traffic be carry on altogether in foreign part and that our own coast be free from its pollution but the crime remain the same wherever perpetrate and there be many circumstance to warrant the belief that some of our citizen be deeply involved in its guilt the mode and manner of carry on this trade be clearly and fearlessly set forth in the accompany document and it would seem that a regular system have be adopt for the purpose of thwart the policy and evade the penalty of our law american vessel with the knowledge as there be good reason to believe of the owner and master be charter or rather purchase by notorious slave dealer in brazil aid by english broker and capitalist with this intent the vessel be only nominally charter at so much per month while in truth it be actually sell to be deliver on the coast of africa the charter party bind the owner in the meantime to take on board as passenger a new crew in brazil who when deliver on the coast be to navigate she back to the port of brazil with her cargo of slave under this agreement the vessel clear from the united states for some port in great britain where a cargo of merchandise know as coast good and design especially for the african trade be purchase ship and consign together with the vessel either directly to the slave dealer himself or to his agent or accomplice in brazil on her arrival a new crew be put on board as passenger and the vessel and cargo consign to an equally guilty factor or agent on the coast of africa where the unlawful purpose originally design be finally consummate the merchandise be exchange for slave the vessel be deliver up her name obliterate her paper destroy her american crew discharge to be provide for by the charter and the new or passenger crew put in command to carry back its miserable freight to the first contriver of the voyage or their employee in brazil
 during the whole progress of this tortuous enterprise it be possible that neither the american crew originally enlist nor the passenger crew put on board in the brazilian port be aware of the nature of the voyage and yet it be on these principally ignorant if not innocent that the penalty of the law be inflict while the guilty contriver the charterer broker owner and master in short all who be most deeply concerned in the crime and its reward for the most part escape unpunished
 it will be see from the examination which have recently take place at rio that the subject of her britannic majesty as well as our own citizen be deeply implicate in this inhuman traffic british factor and agent while they supply africa with british fabric in exchange for slave be chiefly instrumental in the abuse of the american flag and the suggestion contain in the letter of mr. wise whose judicious and zealous effort in the matter can not be too highly commend address to mr. hamilton the british envoy as to the good mode of suppress the evil deserve your most deliberate consideration as they will receive i doubt not that of the british government
 it be also worthy of consideration whether any other measure than those now exist be necessary to give great efficacy to the just and humane policy of our law which already provide for the restoration to africa of slave capture at sea by american cruiser from time to time provision have be make by this government for their comfortable support and maintenance during a limited period after their restoration and it be much to be regret that this liberal policy have not be adopt by great britain as it be it seem to i that the policy it have adopt be calculate rather to perpetuate than to suppress the trade by enlist very large interest in its favor merchant and capitalist furnish the mean of carry it on manufacture for which the negroes be exchange be the product of her workshop the slave when capture instead of be return back to their home be transfer to her colonial possession in the west indies and make the mean of swell the amount of their product by a system of apprenticeship for a term of year and the officer and crew who capture the vessel receive on the whole number of slave so many pound sterling per capita by way of bounty
 it must be obvious that while these large interest be enlist in favor of its continuance it will be difficult if not impossible to suppress the nefarious traffic and that its result would be in effect but a continuance of the slave trade in another and more cruel form for it can be but a matter of little difference to the african whether he be tear from his country and transport to the west indies as a slave in the regular course of the trade or capture .by a cruiser transfer to the same place and make to perform the same labor under the name of an apprentice which be at present the practical operation of the policy adopt
 it be to be hope that her britannic majesty&#39;s government will upon a review of all the circumstance state in these dispatch adopt more efficient measure for the suppression of the trade which she have so long attempt to put down with as yet so little success and more consonant with the original policy of restore the capture african to his home

by abstain from the exercise of doubtful or unauthorized imply power that we have the only sure guaranty against the recurrence of those unfortunate collision between the federal and state authority

the sphere of its delegate authority be also a complete sovereignty while the general government should abstain from the exercise of authority not clearly delegate to it the state should be equally careful that in the maintenance of their right they do not overstep the limit of power reserve to they one of the most distinguished of my predecessor attach deserved importance to the support of the state government in all their right as the most competent administration for our domestic concern and the sure bulwark against antirepublican tendency and to the preservation of the general government in its whole constitutional vigor as the sheet anchor of our peace at home and safety abroad    to the government of the united states have be intrust the exclusive management of our foreign affair beyond that it wield a few general enumerate power it do not force reform on the state it leave individual over whom it cast its protect influence entirely free to improve their own condition by the

and the exercise by the state of power not reserve to they on the other will i fervently hope and believe endure for age to come and dispense the blessing of civil and religious liberty to distant generation to effect object so dear to every patriot i shall devote myself with anxious solicitude it will be my desire to guard against that most fruitful source of danger to the harmonious action of our system which consist in substitute the mere discretion and caprice of the executive or of majority in the legislative department of the government for power which have be withhold from the federal government by the constitution by the theory of our government majority rule but this right be not an arbitrary or unlimited one it be a right to be exercise in subordination to the constitution and in conformity to it one great object of the constitution be to restrain majority from oppress minority or encroach upon their just right minority have a right to appeal to the constitution as a shield against such oppression    that the blessing of liberty which our constitution secure may be enjoy alike by minority and majority the executive have be wisely invest with a qualified veto upon the act of the legislature it be a negative power and be conservative in its character it arrest for the time hasty inconsiderate or unconstitutional legislation invite reconsideration and transfer question at issue between the legislative and executive department to the tribunal of the people like all other power it be subject to be abuse when judiciously and properly exercise the constitution itself may be save from infraction and the right of all preserve and protect    the inestimable value of our federal union be feel and acknowledge by all by this system of united and confederate state our people be permit collectively and individually to seek their own happiness in their own way and the consequence have be most auspicious since the union be form the number of the state have increase from 13 to 28 two of these have take their position as member of the confederacy within the last week our population have increase from three to 20 million new community and state be seek protection under its aegis and multitude from the old world be flock to our shore to participate in its blessing beneath its benign sway peace and prosperity prevail free from the burden and misery of war our trade and intercourse have extend throughout the world mind no long task in devising mean to accomplish or resist scheme of ambition usurpation or conquest be devote itself to man 's true interest in develop his faculty and power and the capacity of nature to minister to his enjoyment genius be free to announce its invention and discovery and the hand be free to accomplish whatever the head conceive not incompatible with the right of a fellow being all distinction of birth or of rank have be abolish all citizen whether native or adopt be place upon term of precise equality all be entitle to equal right and equal protection no union exist between church and state and perfect freedom of opinion be guarantee to all sect and creed    these be some of the blessing secure to our happy land by our federal union to perpetuate they it be our sacred duty to preserve it who shall assign limit to the achievement of free mind and free hand under the protection of this glorious union no treason to mankind since the organization of society would be equal in atrocity to that of he who would lift his hand to destroy it he would overthrow the noble structure of human wisdom which protect himself and his fellow man he would stop the progress of free government and involve his country either in anarchy or despotism he would extinguish the fire of liberty which warm and animate the heart of happy million and invite all the nation of the earth to imitate our example if he say that error and wrong be commit in the administration of the government let he remember that nothing human can be perfect and that under no other system of government reveal by heaven or devise by man have reason be allow so free and broad a scope to combat error have the sword of despot prove to be a safe or surer instrument of reform in government than enlighten reason do he expect to find among the ruin of this union a happy abode for our swarm million than they now have under it every lover of his country must shudder at the thought of the possibility of its dissolution and will be ready to adopt the patriotic sentiment our federal union&mdash;it must be preserve to preserve it the compromise which alone enable our father to form a common constitution for the government and protection of so many state and distinct community of such diversified habit interest and domestic institution must be sacredly and religiously observe any attempt to disturb or destroy these compromise be term of the compact of union can lead to none other than the most ruinous and disastrous consequence    it be a source of deep regret that in some section of our country misguided person have occasionally indulge in scheme and agitation whose object be the destruction of domestic institution exist in other sections&mdash;institution which exist at the adoption of the constitution and be recognize and protect by it all must see that if it be possible for they to be successful in attain their object the dissolution of the union and the consequent destruction of our happy form of government must speedily follow    i be happy to believe that at every period of our existence as a nation there have exist and continue to exist among the great mass of our people a devotion to the union of the state which will shield and protect it against the moral treason of any who would seriously contemplate its destruction to secure a continuance of that devotion the compromise of the constitution must not only be preserve but sectional jealousy and heartburning must be discountenance and all should remember that they be member of the same political family have a common destiny to increase the attachment of our people to the union our law should be just any policy which shall tend to favor monopoly or the peculiar interest of section or class must operate to the prejudice of the interest of their fellow citizen and should be avoid if the compromise of the constitution be preserve if sectional jealousy and heartburning be discountenance if our law be just and the government be practically administer strictly within the limit of power prescribe to it we may discard all apprehension for the safety of the union    with these view of the nature character and object of the government and the value of the union i shall steadily oppose the creation of those institution and system which in their nature tend to pervert it from its legitimate purpose and make it the instrument of section class and individual we need no national bank or other extraneous institution plant around the government to control or strengthen it in opposition to the will of its author experience have teach we how unnecessary they be as auxiliary of the public authorities&mdash;how impotent for good and how powerful for mischief    our be intend to be a plain and frugal government and i shall regard it to be my duty to recommend to congress and as far as the executive be concern to enforce by all the mean within my power the strict economy in the expenditure of the public money which may be compatible with the public interest    a national debt have become almost an institution of european monarchy it be view in some of they as an essential prop to exist government melancholy be the condition of that people whose government can be sustain only by a system which periodically transfer large amount from the labor of the many to the coffer of the few such a system be incompatible with the end for which our republican government be institute under a wise policy the debt contract in our revolution and during the war of 1812 have be happily extinguish by a judicious application of the revenue not require for other necessary purpose it be not doubted that the debt which have grow out of the circumstance of the last few year may be speedily pay off    i congratulate my fellow citizen on the entire restoration of the credit of the general government of the union and that of many of the state happy would it be for the indebted state if they be free from their liability many of which be incautiously contract although the government of the union be neither in a legal nor a moral sense bind for the debt of the state and it would be a violation of our compact of union to assume they yet we can not but feel a deep interest in see all the state meet their public liability and pay off their just debt at the early practicable period that they will do so as soon as it can be do without impose too heavy burden on their citizen there be no reason to doubt the sound moral and honorable feeling of the people of the indebted state can not be question and we be happy to perceive a settle disposition on their part as their ability return after a season of unexampled pecuniary embarrassment to pay off all just demand and to acquiesce in any reasonable measure to accomplish that object    one of the difficulty which we have have to encounter in the practical administration of the government consist in the adjustment of our revenue law and the levy of the taxis necessary for the support of government in the general proposition that no more money shall be collect than the necessity of an economical administration shall require all party seem to acquiesce nor do there seem to be any material difference of opinion as to the absence of right in the government to tax one section of country or one class of citizen or one occupation for the mere profit of another justice and sound policy forbid the federal government to foster one branch of industry to the detriment of another or to cherish the interest of one portion to the injury of another portion of our common country i have heretofore declare to my fellow citizen that in my judgment it be the duty of the government to extend as far as it may be practicable to do so by its revenue law and all other mean within its power fair and just protection to all of the great interest of the whole union embrace agriculture manufacture the mechanic art commerce and navigation i have also declare my opinion to be in favor of a tariff for revenue and that in adjust the detail of such a tariff i have sanction such moderate discriminating duty as would produce the amount of revenue need and at the same time afford reasonable incidental protection to our home industry and that i be oppose to a tariff for protection merely and not for revenue    the power to lay and collect taxis duty impost and excise be an indispensable one to be confer on the federal government which without it would possess no mean of provide for its own support in execute this power by levy a tariff of duty for the support of government the raising of revenue should be the object and protection the incident to reverse this principle and make protection the object and revenue the incident would be to inflict manifest injustice upon all other than the protect interest in levy duty for revenue it be doubtless proper to make such discrimination within the revenue principle as will afford incidental protection to our home interest within the revenue limit there be a discretion to discriminate beyond that limit the rightful exercise of the power be not concede the incidental protection afford to our home interest by discrimination within the revenue range it be believe will be ample in make discrimination all our home interest should as far as practicable be equally protect the large portion of our people be agriculturist other be employ in manufacture commerce navigation and the mechanic art they be all engage in their respective pursuit and their joint labor constitute the national or home industry to tax one branch of this home industry for the benefit of another would be unjust no one of these interest can rightfully claim an advantage over the other or to be enrich by impoverish the other all be equally entitle to the foster care and protection of the government in exercise a sound discretion in levy discriminate duty within the limit prescribe care should be take that it be do in a manner not to benefit the wealthy few at the expense of the toil million by tax low the luxury of life or article of superior quality and high price which can only be consume by the wealthy and high the necessary of life or article of coarse quality and low price which the poor and great mass of our people must consume the burden of government should as far as practicable be distribute justly and equally among all class of our population these general view long entertain on this subject i have deem it proper to reiterate it be a subject upon which conflict interest of section and occupation be suppose to exist and a spirit of mutual concession and compromise in adjust its detail should be cherish by every part of our widespread country as the only mean of preserve harmony and a cheerful acquiescence of all in the operation of our revenue law our patriotic citizen in every part of the union will readily submit to the payment of such taxis as shall be need for the support of their government whether in peace or in war if they be so levied as to distribute the burden as equally as possible among they    the republic of texas have make known her desire to come into our union to form a part of our confederacy and enjoy with we the blessing of liberty secure and guarantee by our constitution texas be once a part of our country&mdash;was unwisely cede away to a foreign power&mdash;is now independent and possess an undoubted right to dispose of a part or the whole of her territory and to merge her sovereignty as a separate and independent state in ours i congratulate my country that by an act of the late congress of the united states the assent of this government have be give to the reunion and it only remain for the two country to agree upon the term to consummate an object so important to both    i regard the question of annexation as belong exclusively to the united states and texas they be independent power competent to contract and foreign nation have no right to interfere with they or to take exception to their reunion foreign power do not seem to appreciate the true character of our government our union be a confederation of independent state whose policy be peace with each other and all the world to enlarge its limit be to extend the dominion of peace over additional territory and increase million the world have nothing to fear from military ambition in our government while the chief magistrate and the popular branch of congress be elect for short term by the suffrage of those million who must in their own person bear all the burden and misery of war our government can not be otherwise than pacific foreign power should therefore look on the annexation of texas to the united states not as the conquest of a nation seek to extend her dominion by arm and violence but as the peaceful acquisition of a territory once her own by add another member to our confederation with the consent of that member thereby diminish the chance of war and opening to they new and ever increase market for their product    to texas the reunion be important because the strong protect arm of our government would be extend over she and the vast resource of her fertile soil and genial climate would be speedily develop while the safety of new orleans and of our whole southwestern frontier against hostile aggression as well as the interest of the whole union would be promote by it    in the early stage of our national existence the opinion prevail with some that our system of confederated state could not operate successfully over an extended territory and serious objection have at different time be make to the enlargement of our boundary these objection be earnestly urge when we acquire louisiana experience have show that they be not well found the title of numerous indian tribe to vast tract of country have be extinguish new state have be admit into the union new territory have be create and our jurisdiction and law extend over they as our population have expand the union have be cement and strengthen as our boundary have be enlarge and our agricultural population have be spread over a large surface our federative system have acquire additional strength and security it may well be doubt whether it would not be in great danger of overthrow if our present population be confine to the comparatively narrow limit of the original 13 state than it be now that they be sparsely settle over a more expand territory it be confidently believe that our system may be safely extend to the utmost bound of our territorial limit and that as it shall be extend the bond of our union so far from be weaken will become strong    none can fail to see the danger to our safety and future peace if texas remain an independent state or become an ally or dependency of some foreign nation more powerful than herself be there one among our citizen who would not prefer perpetual peace with texas to occasional war which so often occur between border independent nation be there one who would not prefer free intercourse with she to high duty on all our product and manufacture which enter her port or cross her frontier be there one who would not prefer an unrestricted communication with her citizen to the frontier obstruction which must occur if she remain out of the union whatever be good or evil in the local institution of texas will remain her own whether annexed to the united states or not none of the present state will be

 this accession to our territory have be a bloodless achievement no arm of force have be raise to produce the result the sword have have no part in the victory we have not seek to extend our territorial possession by conquest or our republican institution over a reluctant people it be the deliberate homage of each people to the great principle of our federative union if we consider the extent of territory involve in the annexation its prospective influence on america the mean by which it have be accomplish spring purely from the choice of the people themselves to share the blessing of our union the history of the world may be challenge to furnish a parallel the jurisdiction of the united states which at the formation of the federal constitution be bound by the st. marys on the atlantic have pass the cape of florida and be peacefully extend to the del norte in contemplate the grandeur of this event it be not to be forget that the result be achieve in despite of the diplomatic interference of european monarchy even france the country which have be our ancient ally the country which have a common interest with we in maintain the freedom of the sea the country which by the cession of louisiana first open to we access to the gulf of mexico the country with which we have be every year draw more and more closely the bond of successful commerce most unexpectedly and to our unfeigned regret take part in an effort to prevent annexation and to impose on texas as a condition of the recognition of her independence by mexico that she would never join herself to the united states we may rejoice that the tranquil and pervade influence of the american principle of self government be sufficient to defeat the purpose of british and french interference and that the almost unanimous voice of the people of texas have give to that interference a peaceful and effective rebuke from this example european governments may learn how vain diplomatic art and intrigue must ever prove upon this continent against that system of self government which seem natural to our soil and which will ever resist foreign interference
 toward texas i do not doubt that a liberal and generous spirit will actuate congress in all that concern her interest and prosperity and that she will never have cause to regret that she have unite her lone star to our glorious constellation
 i regret to inform you that our relation with mexico since your last session have not be of the amicable character which it be our desire to cultivate with all foreign nation on the 6th day of march last the mexican envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the united states make a formal protest in the name of his government against the joint resolution pass by congress for the annexation of texas to the united states which he choose to regard as a violation of the right of mexico and in consequence of it he demand his passport he be inform that the government of the united states do not consider this joint resolution as a violation of any of the right of mexico or that it afford any just cause of offense to his government that the republic of texas be an independent power owe no allegiance to mexico and constitute no part of her territory or rightful sovereignty and jurisdiction he be also assure that it be the sincere desire of this government to maintain with that of mexico relation of peace and good understanding that functionary however notwithstanding these representation and assurance abruptly terminate his mission and shortly afterwards leave the country our envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to mexico be refuse all official intercourse with that government and after remain several month by the permission of his own government he return to the united states thus by the act of mexico all diplomatic intercourse between the two country be suspend
 since that time mexico have until recently occupy an attitude of hostility toward the united states have be marshal and organize army issue proclamation and avow the intention to make war on the united states either by an open declaration or by invade texas both the congress and convention of the people of texas invite this government to send an army into that territory to protect and defend they against the menace attack the moment the term of annexation offer by the united states be accept by texas the latter become so far a part of our own country as to make it our duty to afford such protection and defense i therefore deem it proper as a precautionary measure to order a strong squadron to the coast of mexico and to concentrate an efficient military force on the western frontier of texas our army be order to take position in the country between the nueces and the del norte and to repel any invasion of the texan territory which might be attempt by the mexican force our squadron in the gulf be order to cooperate with the army but though our army and navy be place in a position to defend our own and the right of texas they be order to commit no act of hostility against mexico unless she declare war or be herself the aggressor by strike the first blow the result have be that mexico have make no aggressive movement and our military and naval commander have execute their order with such discretion that the peace of the two republic have not be disturb texas have declare her independence and maintain it by her arm for more than nine year she have have an organized government in successful operation during that period her separate existence as an independent state have be recognize by the united states and the principal power of europe treaty of commerce and navigation have be conclude with she by different nation and it have become manifest to the whole world that any further attempt on the part of mexico to conquer she or overthrow her government would be vain even mexico herself have become satisfied of this fact and whilst the question of annexation be pende before the people of texas during the past summer the government of mexico by a formal act agree to recognize the independence of texas on condition that she would not annex herself to any other power the agreement to acknowledge the independence of texas whether with or without this condition be conclusive against mexico the independence of texas be a fact concede by mexico herself and she have no right or authority to prescribe restriction as to the form of government which texas might afterwards choose to assume but though mexico can not complain of the united states on account of the annexation of texas it be to be regret that serious cause of misunderstanding between the two country continue to exist grow out of unredressed injury inflict by the mexican authority and people on the person and property of citizen of the united states through a long series of year mexico have admit these injury but have neglect and refuse to repair they such be the character of the wrong and such the insult repeatedly offer to american citizen and the american flag by mexico in palpable violation of the law of nation and the treaty between the two country of the 5th of april 1831 that they have be repeatedly bring to the notice of congress by my predecessor as early as the 6th of february 1837 the president of the united states declare in a message to congress that--
 the length of time since some of the injury have be commit the repeat and unavaile application for redress the wanton character of some of the outrage upon the property and person of our citizen upon the officer and flag of the united states independent of recent insult to this government and people by the late extraordinary mexican minister would justify in the eye of all nation immediate war
 he do not however recommend an immediate resort to this extreme measure which he declare should not be use by just and generous nation confide in their strength for injury commit if it can be honorably avoid but in a spirit of forbearance propose that another demand be make on mexico for that redress which have be so long and unjustly withhold in these view committee of the two houses of congress in report make to their respective body concur since these proceeding more than eight year have elapse during which in addition to the wrong then complain of other of an aggravated character have be commit on the person and property of our citizen a special agent be send to mexico in the summer of 1838 with full authority to make another and final demand for redress the demand be make the mexican government promise to repair the wrong of which we complain and after much delay a treaty of indemnity with that view be conclude between the two power on the 11th of april 1839 and be duly ratify by both government by this treaty a joint commission be create to adjudicate and decide on the claim of american citizen on the government of mexico the commission be organize at washington on the 25th day of august 1840 their time be limit to eighteen month at the expiration of which they have adjudicate and decide claim amount to $ 2,026,139.68 in favor of citizen of the united states against the mexican government leave a large amount of claim undecided of the latter the american commissioner have decide in favor of our citizen claim amount to $ 928,627.88 which be leave unacted on by the umpire authorize by the treaty still further claim amount to between three and four million of dollar be submit to the board too late to be consider and be leave undisposed of the sum of $ 2,026,139.68 decide by the board be a liquidated and ascertain debt due by mexico to the claimant and there be no justifiable reason for delay its payment accord to the term of the treaty it be not however pay mexico apply for further indulgence and in that spirit of liberality and forbearance which have ever mark the policy of the united states toward that republic the request be grant and on the 30th of january 1843 a new treaty be conclude by this treaty it be provide that the interest due on the award in favor of claimant under the convention of the 11th of april 1839 should be pay out the 30th of april 1843 and that--
 the principal of the say award and the interest accrue thereon shall be pay in five year in equal installment every three month the say term of five year to commence on the 30th day of april 1843 aforesaid
 the interest due on the 30th day of april 1843 and the three first of the twenty installment have be pay seventeen of these installment remain unpaid seven of which be now due
 the claim which be leave undecided by the joint commission amount to more than $ 3,000,000 together with other claim for spoliation on the property of our citizen be subsequently present to the mexican government for payment and be so far recognize that a treaty provide for their examination and settlement by a joint commission be conclude and sign at mexico on the 20th day of november 1843 this treaty be ratify by the united states with certain amendment to which no just exception could have be take but it have not yet receive the ratification of the mexican government in the meantime our citizen who suffer great loss and some of whom have be reduce from affluence to bankruptcy be without remedy unless their right be enforce by their government such a continued and unprovoked series of wrong could never have be tolerate by the united states have they be commit by one of the principal nation of europe mexico be however a neighbor sister republic which follow our example have achieve her independence and for whose success and prosperity all our sympathy be early enlist the united states be the first to recognize her independence and to receive she into the family of nation and have ever be desirous of cultivate with she a good understanding we have therefore bear the repeat wrong she have commit with great patience in the hope that a return sense of justice would ultimately guide her council and that we might if possible honorably avoid any hostile collision with she without the previous authority of congress the executive possess no power to adopt or enforce adequate remedy for the injury we have suffer or to do more than to be prepare to repel the threaten aggression on the part of mexico after our army and navy have remain on the frontier and coast of mexico for many week without any hostile movement on her part though her menace be continue i deem it important to put an end if possible to this state of thing with this view i cause step to be take in the month of september last to ascertain distinctly and in an authentic form what the design of the mexican government be whether it be their intention to declare war or invade texas or whether they be disposed to adjust and settle in an amicable manner the pende difference between the two country on the 9th of november an official answer be receive that the mexican government consent to renew the diplomatic relation which have be suspend in march last and for that purpose be willing to accredit a minister from the united states with a sincere desire to preserve peace and restore relation of good understanding between the two republics i waive all ceremony as to the manner of renew diplomatic intercourse between they and assume the initiative on the 10th of november a distinguished citizen of louisiana be appoint envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to mexico clothe with full power to adjust and definitively settle all pende difference between the two country include those of boundary between mexico and the state of texas the minister appoint have set out on his mission and be probably by this time near the mexican capital he have be instruct to bring the negotiation with which he be charge to a conclusion at the early practicable period which it be expect will be in time to enable i to communicate the result to congress during the present session until that result be know i forbear to recommend to congress such ulterior measure of redress for the wrong and injury we have so long bear as it would have be proper to make have no such negotiation be institute
 congress appropriate at the last session the sum of $ 275,000 for the payment of the april and july installment of the mexican indemnity for the year 1844
 provide it shall be ascertain to the satisfaction of the american government that say installment have be pay by the mexican government to the agent appoint by the united states to receive the same in such manner as to discharge all claim on the mexican government and say agent to be delinquent in remit the money to the united states
 the unsettled state of our relation with mexico have involve this subject in much mystery the first information in an authentic form from the agent of the united states appoint under the administration of my predecessor be receive at the state department on the 9th of november last this be contain in a letter date the 17th of october address by he to one of our citizen then in mexico with a view of have it communicate to that department from this it appear that the agent on the 20th of september 1844 give a receipt to the treasury of mexico for the amount of the april and july installment of the indemnity in the same communication however he assert that he have not receive a single dollar in cash but that he hold such security as warrant he at the time in give the receipt and entertain no doubt but that he will eventually obtain the money as these installment appear never to have be actually pay by the government of mexico to the agent and as that government have not therefore be release so as to discharge the claim i do not feel myself warrant in direct payment to be make to the claimant out of the treasury without further legislation their case be undoubtedly one of much hardship and it remain for congress to decide whether any and what relief ought to be grant to they our minister to mexico have be instruct to ascertain the fact of the case from the mexican government in an authentic and official form and report the result with as little delay as possible
 my attention be early direct to the negotiation which on the 4th of march last i find pende at washington between the united states and great britain on the subject of the oregon territory three several attempt have be previously make to settle the question in dispute between the two country by negotiation upon the principle of compromise but each have prove unsuccessful these negotiation take place at london in the year 1818 1824 and 1826 -the two first under the administration of mr. monroe and the last under that of mr. adams the negotiation of 1818 having fail to accomplish its object result in the convention of the 20th of october of that year
 by the third article of that convention it was--
 agree that any country that may be claim by either party on the northw coast of america westward of the stony mountains shall together with its harbor bay and creek and the navigation of all river within the same be free and open for the term of ten year from the date of the signature of the present convention to the vessel citizen and subject of the two power it be well understand that this agreement be not to be construe to the prejudice of any claim which either of the two high contracting party may have to any part of the said country nor shall it be take to affect the claim of any other power or state to any part of the say country the only object of the high contracting party in that respect be to prevent dispute and difference amongst themselves
 the negotiation of 1824 be productive of no result and the convention of 1818 be leave unchanged
 the negotiation of 1826 having also fail to effect an adjustment by compromise result in the convention of august 6 1827 by which it be agree to continue in force for an indefinite period the provision of the third article of the convention of the 20th of october 1818 and it be far provide that--
 it shall be competent however to either of the contracting party in case either should think fit at any time after the 20th of october 1828 on give due notice of twelve month to the other contracting party to annul and abrogate this convention and it shall in such case be accordingly entirely annul and abrogate after the expiration of the say term of notice
 in these attempt to adjust the controversy the parallel of the forty ninth degree of north latitude have be offer by the united states to great britain and in those of 1818 and 1826 with a further concession of the free navigation of the columbia river south of that latitude the parallel of the forty ninth degree from the rocky mountains to its intersection with the northeasternmost branch of the columbia and thence down the channel of that river to the sea have be offer by great britain with an addition of a small detach territory north of the columbia each of these proposition have be reject by the party respectively in october 1843 the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the united states in london be authorize to make a similar offer to those make in 1818 and 1826 thus stand the question when the negotiation be shortly afterwards transfer to washington and on the 23d of august 1844 be formally open under the direction of my immediate predecessor like all the previous negotiation it be base upon principle of compromise and the avow purpose of the party be to treat of the respective claim of the two country to the oregon territory with the view to establish a permanent boundary between they westward of the rocky mountains to the pacific ocean
 accordingly on the 26th of august 1844 the british plenipotentiary offer to divide the oregon territory by the forty ninth parallel of north latitude from the rocky mountains to the point of its intersection with the northeasternmost branch of the columbia river and thence down that river to the sea leave the free navigation of the river to be enjoy in common by both party the country south of this line to belong to the united states and that north of it to great britain at the same time he propose in addition to yield to the united states a detach territory north of the columbia extend along the pacific and the straits of fuca from bulfinchs harbor inclusive to hoods canal and to make free to the united states any port or port south of latitude 49&deg which they might desire either on the mainland or on quadra and vancouvers island with the exception of the free port this be the same offer which have be make by the british and reject by the american government in the negotiation of 1826 this proposition be properly reject by the american plenipotentiary on the day it be submit this be the only proposition of compromise offer by the british plenipotentiary the proposition on the part of great britain having be reject the british plenipotentiary request that a proposal should be make by the united states for an equitable adjustment of the question when i come into office i find this to be the state of the negotiation though entertain the settle conviction that the british pretension of title could not be maintain to any portion of the oregon territory upon any principle of public law recognize by nation yet in deference to what have be do by my predecessor and especially in consideration that proposition of compromise have be thrice make by two precede administration to adjust the question on the parallel of 49&deg and in two of they yield to great britain the free navigation of the columbia and that the pende negotiation have be commence on the basis of compromise i deem it to be my duty not abruptly to break it off in consideration too that under the convention of 1818 and 1827 the citizen and subject of the two power hold a joint occupancy of the country i be induce to make another effort to settle this long pende controversy in the spirit of moderation which have give birth to the renew discussion a proposition be accordingly make which be reject by the british plenipotentiary who without submit any other proposition suffer the negotiation on his part to drop express his trust that the united states would offer what he see fit to call some further proposal for the settlement of the oregon question more consistent with fairness and equity and with the reasonable expectation of the british government the proposition thus offer and rejected repeat the offer of the parallel of 49&deg of north latitude which have be make by two precede administration but without propose to surrender to great britain as they have do the free navigation of the columbia river the right of any foreign power to the free navigation of any of our river through the heart of our country be one which i be unwilling to concede it also embrace a provision to make free to great britain any port or port on the cap of quadra and vancouvers island south of this parallel have this be a new question come under discussion for the first time this proposition would not have be make the extraordinary and wholly inadmissible demand of the british government and the rejection of the proposition make in deference alone to what have be do by my predecessor and the imply obligation which their act seem to impose afford satisfactory evidence that no compromise which the united states ought to accept can be effect with this conviction the proposition of compromise which have be make and reject be by my direction subsequently withdraw and our title to the whole oregon territory assert and as be believe maintain by irrefragable fact and argument
 the civilized world will see in these proceeding a spirit of liberal concession on the part of the united states and this government will be relieve from all responsibility which may follow the failure to settle the controversy
 all attempt at compromise having fail it become the duty of congress to consider what measure it may be proper to adopt for the security and protection of our citizen now inhabit or who may hereafter inhabit oregon and for the maintenance of our just title to that territory in adopt measure for this purpose care should be take that nothing be do to violate the stipulation of the convention of 1827 which be still in force the faith of treaty in their letter and spirit have ever be and i trust will ever be scrupulously observe by the united states under that convention a year&#39;s notice be require to be give by either party to the other before the joint occupancy shall terminate and before either can rightfully assert or exercise exclusive jurisdiction over any portion of the territory this notice it would in my judgment be proper to give and i recommend that provision be make by law for give it accordingly and terminate in this manner the convention of the 6th of august 1827
 it will become proper for congress to determine what legislation they can in the meantime adopt without violate this convention beyond all question the protection of our law and our jurisdiction civil and criminal ought to be immediately extend over our citizen in oregon they have have just cause to complain of our long neglect in this particular and have in consequence be compel for their own security and protection to establish a provisional government for themselves strong in their allegiance and ardent in their attachment to the united states they have be thus cast upon their own resource they be anxious that our law should be extend over they and i recommend that this be do by congress with as little delay as possible in the full extent to which the british parliament have proceed in regard to british subject in that territory by their act of july 2 1821 for regulate the fur trade and establish a criminal and civil jurisdiction within certain part of north america by this act great britain extend her law and jurisdiction civil and criminal over her subject engage in the fur trade in that territory by it the court of the province of upper canada be empower to take cognizance of cause civil and criminal justice of the peace and other judicial officer be authorize to be appoint in oregon with power to execute all process issue from the court of that province and to sit and hold court of record for the trial of criminal offense and misdemeanor not make the subject of capital punishment and also of civil case where the cause of action shall not exceed in value the amount or sum of lbs 200
 subsequent to the date of this act of parliament a grant be make from the british crown to the hudsons bay company of the exclusive trade with the indian tribe in the oregon territory subject to a reservation that it shall not operate to the exclusion of the subject of any foreign state who under or by force of any convention for the time be between we and such foreign state respectively may be entitle to and shall be engage in the say trade it be much to be regret that while under this act british subject have enjoy the protection of british law and british judicial tribunal throughout the whole of oregon american citizen in the same territory have enjoy no such protection from their government at the same time the result illustrate the character of our people and their institution in spite of this neglect they have multiply and their number be rapidly increase in that territory they have make no appeal to arm but have peacefully fortify themselves in their new home by the adoption of republican institution for themselves furnish another example of the truth that self government be inherent in the american breast and must prevail it be due to they that they should be embrace and protect by our law it be deem important that our law regulate trade and intercourse with the indian tribe east of the rocky mountains should be extend to such tribe as dwell beyond they the increase emigration to oregon and the care and protection which be due from the government to its citizen in that distant region make it our duty as it be our interest to cultivate amicable relation with the indian tribe of that territory for this purpose i recommend that provision be make for establish an indian agency and such subagencie as may be deem necessary beyond the rocky mountains
 for the protection of emigrant whilst on their way to oregon against the attack of the indian tribe occupy the country through which they pass i recommend that a suitable number of stockade and blockhouse fort be erect along the usual route between our frontier settlement on the missouri and the rocky mountains and that an adequate force of mount rifleman be raise to guard and protect they on their journey the immediate adoption of these recommendation by congress will not violate the provision of the exist treaty it will be do nothing more for american citizen than british law have long since do for british subject in the same territory
 it require several month to perform the voyage by sea from the atlantic states to oregon and although we have a large number of whale ship in the pacific but few of they afford an opportunity of interchange intelligence without great delay between our settlement in that distant region and the united states an overland mail be believe to be entirely practicable and the importance of establish such a mail at least once a month be submit to the favorable consideration of congress
 it be submit to the wisdom of congress to determine whether at their present session and until after the expiration of the year&#39;s notice any other measure may be adopt consistently with the convention of 1827 for the security of our right and the government and protection of our citizen in oregon that it will ultimately be wise and proper to make liberal grant of land to the patriotic pioneer who amidst privation and danger lead the way through savage tribe inhabit the vast wilderness intervene between our frontier settlement and oregon and who cultivate and be ever ready to defend the soil i be fully satisfied to doubt whether they will obtain such grant as soon as the convention between the united states and great britain shall have cease to exist would be to doubt the justice of congress but pende the year&#39;s notice it be worthy of consideration whether a stipulation to this effect may be make consistently with the spirit of that convention
 the recommendation which i have make as to the good manner of secure our right in oregon be submit to congress with great deference should they in their wisdom devise any other mode well calculate to accomplish the same object it shall meet with my hearty concurrence
 at the end of the year&#39;s notice should congress think it proper to make provision for give that notice we shall have reach a period when the national right in oregon must either be abandon or firmly maintain that they can not be abandon without a sacrifice of both national honor and interest be too clear to admit of doubt

 under the eighth section of the tariff act of the 30th of august 1842 a duty of 15 cent per gallon be impose on port wine in cask while on the red wine of several other country when import in cask a duty of only 6 cent per gallon be impose this discrimination so far as regard the port wine of portugal be deem a violation of our treaty with that power which provide that--
 no high or other duty shall be impose on the importation into the united states of america of any article the growth produce or manufacture of the kingdom and possession of portugal than such as be or shall be payable on the like article be the growth produce or manufacture of any other foreign country

 the attention of congress be invite to the importance of make suitable modification and reduction of the rate of duty impose by our present tariff law the object of impose duty on import should be to raise revenue to pay the necessary expense of government congress may undoubtedly in the exercise of a sound discretion discriminate in arrange the rate of duty on different article but the discrimination should be within the revenue standard and be make with the view to raise money for the support of government
 it become important to understand distinctly what be mean by a revenue standard the maximum of which should not be exceed in the rate of duty impose it be concede and experience prove that duty may be lay so high as to diminish or prohibit altogether the importation of any give article and thereby lessen or destroy the revenue which at low rate would be derive from its importation such duty exceed the revenue rate and be not impose to raise money for the support of government if congress levy a duty for revenue of 1 per cent on a give article it will produce a give amount of money to the treasury and will incidentally and necessarily afford protection or advantage to the amount of 1 per cent to the home manufacturer of a similar or like article over the importer if the duty be raise to 10 per cent it will produce a great amount of money and afford great protection if it be still raise to 20 25 or 30 per cent and if as it be raise the revenue derive from it be find to be increase the protection or advantage will also be increase but if it be raise to 31 per cent and it be find that the revenue produce at that rate be less than at 30 per cent it cease to be a revenue duty the precise point in the ascending scale of duty at which it be ascertain from experience that the revenue be great be the maximum rate of duty which can be lay for the bona fide purpose of collect money for the support of government to raise the duty high than that point and thereby diminish the amount collect be to levy they for protection merely and not for revenue as long then as congress may gradually increase the rate of duty on a give article and the revenue be increase by such increase of duty they be within the revenue standard when they go beyond that point and as they increase the duty the revenue be diminish or destroy the act cease to have for its object the raising of money to support government but be for protection merely it do not follow that congress should levy the high duty on all article of import which they will bear within the revenue standard for such rate would probably produce a much large amount than the economical administration of the government would require nor do it follow that the duty on all article should be at the same or a horizontal rate some article will bear a much high revenue duty than other below the maximum of the revenue standard congress may and ought to discriminate in the rate impose take care so to adjust they on different article as to produce in the aggregate the amount which when add to the proceed of the sale of public land may be need to pay the economical expense of the government
 in levy a tariff of duty congress exercise the tax power and for purpose of revenue may select the object of taxation they may exempt certain article altogether and permit their importation free of duty on other they may impose low duty in these class should be embrace such article of necessity as be in general use and especially such as be consume by the laborer and poor as well as by the wealthy citizen care should be take that all the great interest of the country include manufacture agriculture commerce navigation and the mechanic art should as far as may be practicable derive equal advantage from the incidental protection which a just system of revenue duty may afford taxation direct or indirect be a burden and it should be so impose as to operate as equally as may be on all class in the proportion of their ability to bear it to make the tax power an actual benefit to one class necessarily increase the burden of the other beyond their proportion and would be manifestly unjust the term protection to domestic industry be of popular import but they should apply under a just system to all the various branch of industry in our country the farmer or planter who toil yearly in his field be engage in domestic industry and be as much entitle to have his labor protect as the manufacturer the man of commerce the navigator or the mechanic who be engage also in domestic industry in their different pursuit the joint labor of all these class constitute the aggregate of the domestic industry of the nation and they be equally entitle to the nation&#39;s protection no one of they can justly claim to be the exclusive recipient of protection which can only be afford by increase burden on the domestic industry of the other
 if these view be correct it remain to inquire how far the tariff act of 1842 be consistent with they that many of the provision of that act be in violation of the cardinal principle here lay down all must concede the rate of duty impose by it on some article be prohibitory and on other so high as greatly to diminish importation and to produce a less amount of revenue than would be derive from low rate they operate as protection merely to one branch of domestic industry by tax other branch
 by the introduction of minimum or assume and false value and by the imposition of specific duty the injustice and inequality of the act of 1842 in its practical operation on different class and pursuit be see and feel many of the oppressive duty impose by it under the operation of these principle range from 1 per cent to more than 200 per cent they be prohibitory on some article and partially so on other and bear most heavily on article of common necessity and but lightly on article of luxury it be so framed that much the great burden which it impose be throw on labor and the poor class who be least able to bear it while it protect capital and exempt the rich from pay their just proportion of the taxation require for the support of government while it protect the capital of the wealthy manufacturer and increase his profit it do not benefit the operative or laborer in his employment whose wage have not be increase by it article of prime necessity or of coarse quality and low price use by the masse of the people be in many instance subject by it to heavy taxis while article of fine quality and high price or of luxury which can be use only by the opulent be lightly tax it impose heavy and unjust burden on the farmer the planter the commercial man and those of all other pursuit except the capitalist who have make his investment in manufacture all the great interest of the country be not as nearly as may be practicable equally protect by it
 the government in theory know no distinction of person or class and should not bestow upon some favor and privilege which all other may not enjoy it be the purpose of its illustrious founder to base the institution which they rear upon the great and unchanging principle of justice and equity conscious that if administer in the spirit in which they be conceive they would be feel only by the benefit which they diffuse and would secure for themselves a defense in the heart of the people more powerful than stand army and all the mean and appliance invent to sustain government found in injustice and oppression
 the well know fact that the tariff act of 1842 be pass by a majority of one vote in the senate and two in the house of representatives and that some of those who feel themselves constrain under the peculiar circumstance exist at the time to vote in its favor proclaim its defect and express their determination to aid in its modification on the first opportunity afford strong and conclusive evidence that it be not intend to be permanent and of the expediency and necessity of its thorough revision
 in recommend to congress a reduction of the present rate of duty and a revision and modification of the act of 1842 i be far from entertain opinion unfriendly to the manufacturer on the contrary i desire to see they prosperous as far as they can be so without impose unequal burden on other interest the advantage under any system of indirect taxation even within the revenue standard must be in favor of the manufacturing interest and of this no other interest will complain
 i recommend to congress the abolition of the minimum principle or assume arbitrary and false value and of specific duty and the substitution in their place of ad valorem duty as the fairest and most equitable indirect tax which can be impose by the ad valorem principle all article be tax accord to their cost or value and those which be of inferior quality or of small cost bear only the just proportion of the tax with those which be of superior quality or great cost the article consume by all be tax at the same rate a system of ad valorem revenue duty with proper discrimination and proper guard against fraud in collect they it be not doubted will afford ample incidental advantage to the manufacturer and enable they to derive as great profit as can be derive from any other regular business it be believe that such a system strictly within the revenue standard will place the manufacture interest on a stable footing and inure to their permanent advantage while it will as nearly as may be practicable extend to all the great interest of the country the incidental protection which can be afford by our revenue law such a system when once firmly establish would be permanent and not be subject to the constant complaint agitation and change which must ever occur when duty be not lay for revenue but for the protection merely of a favor interest
 in the deliberation of congress on this subject it be hope that a spirit of mutual concession and compromise between conflict interest may prevail and that the result of their labor may be crown with the happy consequence
 by the constitution of the united states it be provide that no money shall be draw from the treasury but in consequence of appropriation make by law a public treasury be undoubtedly contemplate and intend to be create in which the public money should be keep from the period of collection until need for public use in the collection and disbursement of the public money no agency have ever be employ by law except such as be appoint by the government directly responsible to it and under its control the safe keeping of the public money should be confide to a public treasury create by law and under like responsibility and control it be not to be imagine that the framer of the constitution could have intend that a treasury should be create as a place of deposit and safe keeping of the public money which be irresponsible to the government the first congress under the constitution by the act of the 2d of september 1789 to establish the treasury department provide for the appointment of a treasurer and make it his duty to receive and keep the money of the united states and at all time to submit to the secretary of the treasury and the comptroller or either of they the inspection of the money in his hand
 that bank national or state could not have be intend to be use as a substitute for the treasury speak of in the constitution as keeper of the public money be manifest from the fact that at that time there be no national bank and but three or four state bank of limited capital exist in the country their employment as depository be at first resort to a limited extent but with no avow intention of continue they permanently in place of the treasury of the constitution when they be afterwards from time to time employ it be from motive of suppose convenience our experience have show that when banking corporation have be the keeper of the public money and be thereby make in effect the treasury the government can have no guaranty that it can command the use of its own money for public purpose the late bank of the united states prove to be faithless the state bank which be afterwards employ be faithless but a few year ago with million of public money in their keeping the government be bring almost to bankruptcy and the public credit seriously impair because of their inability or indisposition to pay on demand to the public creditor in the only currency recognize by the constitution their failure occur in a period of peace and great inconvenience and loss be suffer by the public from it have the country be involve in a foreign war that inconvenience and loss would have be much great and might have result in extreme public calamity the public money should not be mingle with the private fund of bank or individual or be use for private purpose when it be place in bank for safe keeping it be in effect loan to they without interest and be loan by they upon interest to the borrower from they the public money be convert into banking capital and be use and loan out for the private profit of bank stockholder and when call for as be the case in 1837 it may be in the pocket of the borrower from the bank instead of be in the public treasury contemplate by the constitution the framer of the constitution could never have intend that the money pay into the treasury should be thus convert to private use and place beyond the control of the government
 bank which hold the public money be often tempt by a desire of gain to extend their loan increase their circulation and thus stimulate if not produce a spirit of speculation and extravagance which soon or later must result in ruin to thousand if the public money be not permit to be thus use but be keep in the treasure and pay out to the public creditor in gold and silver the temptation afford by its deposit with bank to an undue expansion of their business would be check while the amount of the constitutional currency leave in circulation would be enlarge by its employment in the public collection and disbursement and the bank themselves would in consequence be find in a safe and sounder condition at present state bank be employ as depository but without adequate regulation of law whereby the public money can be secure against the casualty and excess revulsion suspension and defalcation to which from overissue overtrade an inordinate desire for gain or other cause they be constantly expose the secretary of the treasury have in all case when it be practicable take collateral security for the amount which they hold by the pledge of stock of the united states or such of the states as be in good credit some of the deposit bank have give this description of security and other have decline to do so
 entertain the opinion that the separation of the money of the government from banking institution be indispensable for the safety of the fund of the government and the right of the people i recommend to congress that provision be make by law for such separation and that a constitutional treasury be create for the safe keeping of the public money the constitutional treasury recommend be design as a secure depository for the public money without any power to make loan or discount or to issue any paper whatever as a currency or circulation i can not doubt that such a treasury as be contemplate by the constitution should be independent of all banking corporation the money of the people should be keep in the treasury of the people create by law and be in the custody of agent of the people choose by themselves accord to the form of the constitution agent who be directly responsible to the government who be under adequate bond and oath and who be subject to severe punishment for any embezzlement private use or misapplication of the public fund and for any failure in other respect to perform their duty to say that the people or their government be incompetent or not to be trust with the custody of their own money in their own treasury provide by themselves but must rely on the president cashier and stockholder of banking corporation not appoint by they nor responsible to they would be to concede that they be incompetent for self government
 in recommend the establishment of a constitutional treasury in which the public money shall be keep i desire that adequate provision be make by law for its safety and that all executive discretion or control over it shall be remove except such as may be necessary in direct its disbursement in pursuance of appropriation make by law
 under our present land system limit the minimum price at which the public land can be enter to $ 1.25 per acre large quantity of land of inferior quality remain unsold because they will not command that price from the record of the general land office it appear that of the public land remain unsold in the several states and territories in which they be situate 39,105,577 acre have be in the market subject to entry more than twenty year 49,638,644 acre for more than fifteen year 73,074,600 acre for more than ten year and 106,176,961 acre for more than five year much the large portion of these land will continue to be unsalable at the minimum price at which they be permit to be sell so long as large territory of land from which the more valuable portion have not be select be annually bring into market by the government with the view to the sale and settlement of these inferior land i recommend that the price be graduate and reduce below the present minimum rate confine the sale at the reduce price to settler and cultivator in limited quantity if graduate and reduce in price for a limited term to $ 1 per acre and after the expiration of that period for a second and third term to lower rate a large portion of these land would be purchase and many worthy citizen who be unable to pay high rate could purchase home for themselves and their family by adopt the policy of graduation and reduction of price these inferior land will be sell for their real value while the states in which they lie will be free from the inconvenience if not injustice to which they be subject in consequence of the united states continue to own large quantity of the public land within their border not liable to taxation for the support of their local government
 i recommend the continuance of the policy of grant preemption in its most liberal extent to all those who have settle or may hereafter settle on the public land whether survey or unsurveye to which the indian title may have be extinguish at the time of settlement it have be find by experience that in consequence of combination of purchaser and other cause a very small quantity of the public land when sell at public auction command a high price than the minimum rate establish by law the settler on the public land be however but rarely able to secure their home and improvement at the public sale at that rate because these combination by mean of the capital they command and their superior ability to purchase render it impossible for the settler to compete with they in the market by put down all competition these combination of capitalist and speculator be usually enable to purchase the land include the improvement of the settler at the minimum price of the government and either turn they out of their home or extort from they accord to their ability to pay double or quadruple the amount pay for they to the government it be to the enterprise and perseverance of the hardy pioneer of the west who penetrate the wilderness with their family suffer the danger the privation and hardship attend the settlement of a new country and prepare the way for the body of emigrant who in the course of a few year usually follow they that we be in a great degree indebte for the rapid extension and aggrandizement of our country
 experience have prove that no portion of our population be more patriotic than the hardy and brave man of the frontier or more ready to obey the call of their country and to defend her right and her honor whenever and by whatever enemy assail they should be protect from the grasp speculator and secure at the minimum price of the public land in the humble home which they have improve by their labor with this end in view all vexatious or unnecessary restriction impose upon they by the exist preemption law should be repeal or modify it be the true policy of the government to afford facility to its citizen to become the owner of small portion of our vast public domain at low and moderate rate
 the present system of manage the mineral land of the united states be believe to be radically defective more than 1,000,000 acre of the public land suppose to contain lead and other mineral have be reserve from sale and numerous lease upon they have be grant to individual upon a stipulate rent the system of grant lease have prove to be not only unprofitable to the government but unsatisfactory to the citizen who have go upon the land and must if continue lie the foundation of much future difficulty between the government and the lessee accord to the official record the amount of rent receive by the government for the year 1841 1842 1843 and 1844 be $ 6,354.74 while the expense of the system during the same period include salary of superintendent agent clerk and incidental expense be $ 26,111.11 the income be less than one fourth of the expense to this pecuniary loss may be add the injury sustain by the public in consequence of the destruction of timber and the careless and wasteful manner of work the mine the system have give rise to much litigation between the united states and individual citizen produce irritation and excitement in the mineral region and involve the government in heavy additional expenditure it be believe that similar loss and embarrassment will continue to occur while the present system of lease these land remain unchanged these land be now under the superintendence and care of the war department with the ordinary duty of which they have no proper or natural connection i recommend the repeal of the present system and that these land be place under the superintendence and management of the general land office as other public land and be bring into market and sell upon such term as congress in their wisdom may prescribe reserve to the government an equitable percentage of the gross amount of mineral product and that the preemption principle be extend to resident miner and settler upon they at the minimum price which may be establish by congress

 serious difficulty of long standing continue to distract the several party into which the cherokees be unhappily divided the effort of the government to adjust the difficulty between they have heretofore prove unsuccessful and there remain no probability that this desirable object can be accomplish without the aid of further legislation by congress i will at an early period of your session present the subject for your consideration accompany with an exposition of the complaint and claim of the several party into which the nation be divide with a view to the adoption of such measure by congress as may enable the executive to do justice to they respectively and to put an end if possible to the dissension which have long prevail and still prevail among they
 i refer you to the report of the secretary of the navy for the present condition of that branch of the national defense and for grave suggestion have for their object the increase of its efficiency and a great economy in its management during the past year the officer and man have perform their duty in a satisfactory manner the order which have be give have be execute with promptness and fidelity a large force than have often form one squadron under our flag be readily concentrated in the gulf of mexico and apparently without unusual effort it be especially to be observe that notwithstanding the union of so considerable a force no act be commit that even the jealousy of an irritated power could construe as an act of aggression and that the commander of the squadron and his officer in strict conformity with their instruction hold themselves ever ready for the most active duty have achieve the still purer glory of contribute to the preservation of peace it be believe that at all our foreign station the honor of our flag have be maintain and that generally our ship of war have be distinguish for their good discipline and order i be happy to add that the display of maritime force which be require by the event of the summer have be make wholly within the usual appropriation for the service of the year so that no additional appropriation be require
 the commerce of the united states and with it the navigate interest have steadily and rapidly increase since the organization of our government until it be believe we be now second to but one power in the world and at no distant day we shall probably be inferior to none expose as they must be it have be a wise policy to afford to these important interest protection with our ship of war distribute in the great highway of trade throughout the world for more than thirty year appropriation have be make and annually expend for the gradual increase of our naval force in peace our navy perform the important duty of protect our commerce and in the event of war will be as it have be a most efficient mean of defense
 the successful use of steam navigation on the ocean have be follow by the introduction of war steamer in great and increase number into the navy of the principal maritime power of the world a due regard to our own safety and to an efficient protection to our large and increase commerce demand a corresponding increase on our part no country have great facility for the construction of vessel of this description than ours or can promise itself great advantage from their employment they be admirably adapt to the protection of our commerce to the rapid transmission of intelligence and to the coast defense in pursuahce of the wise policy of a gradual increase of our navy large supply of live oak timber and other material for shipbuilding have be collect and be now under shelter and in a state of good preservation while iron steamer can be build with great facility in various part of the union the use of iron as a material especially in the construction of steamer which can enter with safety many of the harbor along our coast now inaccessible to vessel of great draft and the practicability of construct they in the interior strongly recommend that liberal appropriation should be make for this important object whatever may have be our policy in the early stage of the government when the nation be in its infancy our shipping interest and commerce comparatively small our resource limit our population sparse and scarcely extend beyond the limit of the original thirteen state that policy must be essentially different now that we have grow from three to more than twenty million of people that our commerce carry in our own ship be find in every sea and that our territorial boundary and settlement have be so greatly expand neither our commerce nor our long line of coast on the ocean and on the lakes can be successfully defend against foreign aggression by mean of fortification alone these be essential at important commercial and military point but our chief reliance for this object must be on a well organize efficient navy the benefit result from such a navy be not confine to the atlantic states the production of the interior which seek a market abroad be directly dependent on the safety and freedom of our commerce the occupation of the balize below new orleans by a hostile force would embarrass if not stagnate the whole export trade of the mississippi and affect the value of the agricultural product of the entire valley of that mighty river and its tributary
 it have never be our policy to maintain large stand army in time of peace they be contrary to the genius of our free institution would impose heavy burden on the people and be dangerous to public liberty our reliance for protection and defense on the land must be mainly on our citizen soldier who will be ever ready as they ever have be ready in time past to rush with alacrity at the call of their country to her defense this description of force however can not defend our coast harbor and inland sea nor protect our commerce on the ocean or the lakes these must be protect by our navy
 consider an increase naval force and especially of steam vessel correspond with our growth and importance as a nation and proportion to the increase and increase naval power of other nation of vast importance as regard our safety and the great and grow interest to be protect by it i recommend the subject to the favorable consideration of congress
 the report of the postmaster general herewith communicate contain a detailed statement of the operation of his department during the pass year it will be see that the income from postage will fall short of the expenditure for the year between $ 1,000,000 and $ 2,000,000 this deficiency have be cause by the reduction of the rate of postage which be make by the act of the 3d of march last no principle have be more generally acquiesce in by the people than that this department should sustain itself by limit its expenditure to its income congress have never seek to make it a source of revenue for general purpose except for a short period during the last war with great britain nor should it ever become a charge on the general treasury if congress shall adhere to this principle as i think they ought it will be necessary either to curtail the present mail service so as to reduce the expenditure or so to modify the act of the 3d of march last as to improve its revenue the extension of the mail service and the additional facility which will be demand by the rapid extension and increase of population on our western frontier will not admit of such curtailment as will materially reduce the present expenditure in the adjustment of the tariff of postage the interest of the people demand that the low rate be adopt which will produce the necessary revenue to meet the expenditure of the department i invite the attention of congress to the suggestion of the postmaster general on this subject under the belief that such a modification of the late law may be make as will yield sufficient revenue without further call on the treasury and with very little change in the present rate of postage proper measure have be take in pursuance of the act of the 3d of march last for the establishment of line of mail steamer between this and foreign country the importance of this service commend itself strongly to favorable consideration
 with the growth of our country the public business which devolve on the head of the several executive departments have greatly increase in some respect the distribution of duty among they seem to be incongruous and many of these might be transfer from one to another with advantage to the public interest a more auspicious time for the consideration of this subject by congress with a view to system in the organization of the several departments and a more appropriate division of the public business will not probably occur
 the most important duty of the state department relate to our foreign affair by the great enlargement of the family of nation the increase of our commerce and the corresponding extension of our consular system the business of this department have be greatly increase in its present organization many duty of a domestic nature and consist of detail be devolve on the secretary of state which do not appropriately belong to the foreign department of the government and may properly be transfer to some other department one of these grow out of the present state of the law concern the patent office which a few year since be a subordinate clerkship but have become a distinct bureau of great importance with an excellent internal organization it be still connect with the state department in the transaction of its business question of much importance to inventor and to the community frequently arise which by exist law be refer for decision to a board of which the secretary of state be a member these question be legal and the connection which now exist between the state department and the patent office may with great propriety and advantage be transfer to the attorney general
 in his last annual message to congress mr. madison invite attention to a proper provision for the attorney general as an important improvement in the executive establishment this recommendation be repeat by some of his successor the official duty of the attorney general have be much increase within a few year and his office have become one of great importance his duty may be still far increase with advantage to the public interest as an executive officer his residence and constant attention at the seat of government be require legal question involve important principle and large amount of public money be constantly refer to he by the president and executive departments for his examination and decision the public business under his official management before the judiciary have be so augmented by the extension of our territory and the act of congress authorize suit against the united states for large body of valuable public land as greatly to increase his labor and responsibility i therefore recommend that the attorney general be place on the same footing with the head of the other executive departments with such subordinate officer provide by law for his department as may be require to discharge the additional duty which have be or may be devolve upon he
 congress possess the power of exclusive legislation over the district of columbia and i commend the interest of its inhabitant to your favorable consideration the people of this district have no legislative body of their own and must confide their local as well as their general interest to representative in whose election they have no voice and over whose official conduct they have no control each member of the national legislature should consider himself as their immediate representative and should be the more ready to give attention to their interest and want because he be not responsible to they i recommend that a liberal and generous spirit may characterize your measure in relation to they i shall be ever disposed to show a proper regard for their wish and within constitutional limit shall at all time cheerfully cooperate with you for the advancement of their welfare
 i trust it may not be deem inappropriate to the occasion for i to dwell for a moment on the memory of the most eminent citizen of our country who during the summer that be go by have descend to the tomb the enjoyment of contemplating at the advanced age of near fourscore year the happy condition of his country cheer the last hour of andrew jackson who depart this life in the tranquil hope of a blessed immortality his death be happy as his life have be eminently useful he have an unfaltere confidence in the virtue and capacity of the people and in the permanence of that free government which he have largely contribute to establish and defend his great deed have secure to he the affection of his fellow citizen and it be his happiness to witness the growth and glory of his country which he love so well he depart amidst the benediction of million of free man the nation pay its tribute to his memory at his tomb come generation will learn from his example the love of country and the right of man in his language on a similar occasion to the present i now commend you fellow citizen to the guidance of almighty god with a full reliance on his merciful providence for the maintenance of our free institution and with an earnest supplication that whatever error it may be my lot to commit in discharge the arduous duty which have devolve on i will find a remedy in the harmony and wisdom of your counsel

in answer to the inquiry of the senate contain in their resolution of the 17th instant whether in my judgment any circumstance connect with or grow out of the foreign relation of this country require at this time an increase of our naval or military force and if so what those circumstance be i have to express the opinion that a wise precaution demand such increase
 in my annual message of the 2d of december last i recommend to the favorable consideration of congress an increase of our naval force especially of our steam navy and the raising of an adequate military force to guard and protect such of our citizen as might think proper to emigrate to oregon since that period i have see no cause to recall or modify these recommendation on the contrary reason exist which in my judgment render it proper not only that they should be promptly carry into effect but that additional provision should be make for the public defense
 the consideration of such additional provision be bring before appropriate committee of the two houses of congress in answer to call make by they in report prepare with my sanction by the secretary of war and the secretary of the navy on the 29th of december and the 8th of january last a mode of communication with congress not unusual and under exist circumstance believe to be most eligible subsequent event have confirm i in the opinion that these recommendation be proper as precautionary measure
 it be a wise maxim of the father of his country that to be prepare for war be one of the most efficient mean of preserve peace and that avoid occasion of expense by cultivate peace we should remember also that timely disbursement to prepare for danger frequently prevent much great disbursement to repel it the general obligation to perform this duty be greatly strengthen by fact know to the whole world a controversy respect the oregon territory now exist between the united states and great britain and while as far as we know the relation of the latter with all european nation be of the most pacific character she be make unusual and extraordinary armament and warlike preparation naval and military both at home and in her north american possession
 it can not be disguise that however sincere may be the desire of peace in the event of a rupture these armament and preparation would be use against our country whatever may have be the original purpose of these preparation the fact be undoubted that they be now proceed in part at least with a view to the contingent possibility of a war with the united states the general policy of make additional warlike preparation be distinctly announce in the speech from the throne as late as january last and have since be reiterate by the minister of the crown in both house of parliament under this aspect of our relation with great britain i can not doubt the propriety of increase our mean of defense both by land and sea this can give great britain no cause of offense nor increase the danger of a rupture if on the contrary we should fold our arm in security and at last be suddenly involve in hostility for the maintenance of our just right without any adequate preparation our responsibility to the country would be of the grave character should collision between the two country be avoid as i sincerely trust it may be the additional charge upon the treasury in make the necessary preparation will not be lose while in the event of such a collision they would be indispensable for the maintenance of our national right and national honor
 i have see no reason to change or modify the recommendation of my annual message in regard to the oregon question the notice to abrogate the treaty of the 6th of august 1827 be authorize by the treaty itself and can not be regard as a warlike measure and i can not withhold my strong conviction that it should be promptly give the other recommendation be in conformity with the exist treaty and would afford to american citizen in oregon no more than the same measure of protection which have long since be extend to british subject in that territory
 the state of our relation with mexico be still in an unsettled condition since the meeting of congress another revolution have take place in that country by which the government have pass into the hand of new ruler this event have procrastinate and may possibly defeat the settlement of the difference between the united states and that country the minister of the united states to mexico at the date of the last advice have not be receive by the exist authority demonstration of a character hostile to the united states continue to be make in mexico which have render it proper in my judgment to keep nearly two third of our army on our southwestern frontier in do this many of the regular military post have be reduce to a small force inadequate to their defense should an emergency arise
 in view of these circumstance it be my judgment that an increase of our naval and military force be at this time require to place the country in a suitable state of defense at the same time it be my settle purpose to pursue such a course of policy as may be well calculate to preserve both with great britain and mexico an honorable peace which nothing will so effectually promote as unanimity in our council and a firm maintenance of all our just right

in my annual message of the 2d of december last it be state that serious difficulty of long standing continue to distract the several party into which the cherokee tribe of indians be unhappily divide that all the effort of the government to adjust these difficulty have prove to be unsuccessful and would probably remain so without the aid of further legislation by congress subsequent event have confirm this opinion
 i communicate herewith for the information of congress a report of the secretary of war transmit a report of the commissioner of indian affairs with accompany document together with memorial which have be receive from the several band or party of the cherokees themselves it will be perceive that internal feud still exist which call for the prompt intervention of the government of the united states
 since the meeting of congress several unprovoked murder have be commit by the strong upon the weak party of the tribe which will probably remain unpunished by the indian authority and there be reason to apprehend that similar outrage will continue to be perpetrate unless restrain by the authority of the united states
 many of the weak party have be compel to seek refuge beyond the limit of the indian country and within the state of arkansas and be destitute of the mean for their daily subsistence the military force of the united states station on the western frontier have be active in their exertion to suppress these outrage and to execute the treaty of 1835 by which it be stipulate that the united states agree to protect the cherokee nation from domestic strife and foreign enemy and against intestine war between the several tribe
 these exertion of the army have prove to a great extent unavaile for the reason state in the accompany document include communication from the officer command at fort gibson
 i submit for the consideration of congress the propriety of make such amendment of the law regulate intercourse with the indian tribe as will subject to trial and punishment in the court of the united states all indians guilty of murder and such other felony as may be designate when commit on other indians within the jurisdiction of the united states
 such a modification of the exist law be suggest because if offender against the law of humanity in the indian country be leave to be punish by indian law they will generally if not always be permit to escape with impunity this have be the case in repeat instance among the cherokees for year unprovoked murder have be commit and yet no effort have be make to bring the offender to punishment should this state of thing continue it be not difficult to foresee that the weak party will be finally destroy as the guardian of the indian tribe the government of the united states be bind by every consideration of duty and humanity to interpose to prevent such a disaster
 from the examination which i have make into the actual state of thing in the cherokee nation i be satisfied that there be no probability that the different band or party into which it be divide can ever again live together in peace and harmony and that the well being of the whole require that they should be separate and live under separate government as distinct tribe
 that portion who emigrate to the west of the mississippi prior to the year 1819 commonly call the old settlers and that portion who make the treaty of 1835 know as the treaty party it be believe would willingly unite and could live together in harmony the number of these as nearly as can be estimate be about one third of the tribe the whole number on all the band or party do not probably exceed 20,000 the country which they occupy embrace 7,000,000 acre of land with the privilege of an outlet to the western limit of the united states this country be susceptible of division and be large enough for all
 i submit to congress the propriety of either divide the country which they at present occupy or of provide by law a new home for the one or the other of the band or party now in hostile array against each other as the most effectual if not the only mean of preserve the weak party from massacre and total extermination should congress favor the division of the country as suggest and the separation of the cherokees into two distinct tribe justice will require that the annuity and fund belong to the whole now hold in trust for they by the united states should be equitably distribute among the party accord to their respective claim and number
 there be still a small number of the cherokee tribe remain within the state of north carolina who accord to the stipulation of the treaty of 1835 should have emigrate with their brother to the west of the mississippi it be desirable that they should be remove and in the event of a division of the country in the west or of a new home be provide for a portion of the tribe that they be permit to join either party as they may prefer and be incorporate with they
 i submit the whole subject to congress that such legislative measure may be adopt as will be just to all the party or band of the tribe such measure i be satisfied be the only mean of arrest the horrid and inhuman massacre which have mark the history of the cherokees for the last few year and especially for the last few month
 the cherokees have be regard as among the most enlightened of the indian tribe but experience have prove that they have not yet advanced to such a state of civilization as to dispense with the guardian care and control of the government of the united states

the exist state of the relation between the united states and mexico render it proper that i should bring the subject to the consideration of congress in my message at the commencement of your present session the state of these relation the cause which lead to the suspension of diplomatic intercourse between the two country in march 1845 and the long continue and unredressed wrong and injury commit by the mexican government on citizen of the united states in their person and property be briefly set forth
 as the fact and opinion which be then lay before you be carefully consider i can not well express my present conviction of the condition of affair up to that time than by refer you to that communication
 the strong desire to establish peace with mexico on liberal and honorable term and the readiness of this government to regulate and adjust our boundary and other cause of difference with that power on such fair and equitable principle as would lead to permanent relation of the most friendly nature induce i in september last to seek the reopening of diplomatic relation between the two country every measure adopt on our part have for its object the furtherance of these desire result in communicating to congress a succinct statement of the injury which we have suffer from mexico and which have be accumulate during a period of more than twenty year every expression that could tend to inflame the people of mexico or defeat or delay a pacific result be carefully avoid an envoy of the united states repair to mexico with full power to adjust every exist difference but though present on the mexican soil by agreement between the two government invest with full power and bear evidence of the most friendly disposition his mission have be unavaile the mexican government not only refuse to receive he or listen to his proposition but after a long continue series of menace have at last invade our territory and shed the blood of our fellow citizen on our own soil
 it now become my duty to state more in detail the origin progress and failure of that mission in pursuance of the instruction give in september last an inquiry be make on the 13th of october 1845 in the most friendly term through our consul in mexico of the minister for foreign affair whether the mexican government would receive an envoy from the united states intrust with full power to adjust all the question in dispute between the two government with the assurance that should the answer be in the affirmative such an envoy would be immediately dispatch to mexico the mexican minister on the 15th of october give an affirmative answer to this inquiry request at the same time that our naval force at vera cruz might be withdraw lest its continued presence might assume the appearance of menace and coercion pende the negotiation this force be immediately withdraw on the 10th of november 1845 mr. john slidell of louisiana be commission by i as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the united states to mexico and be intrust with full power to adjust both the question of the texas boundary and of indemnification to our citizen the redress of the wrong of our citizen naturally and inseparably blend itself with the question of boundary the settlement of the one question in any correct view of the subject involve that of the other i could not for a moment entertain the idea that the claim of our much injure and long suffer citizen many of which have exist for more than twenty year should be postpone or separate from the settlement of the boundary question
 mr. slidell arrive at vera cruz on the 30th of november and be courteously receive by the authority of that city but the government of general herrera be then totter to its fall the revolutionary party have seize upon the texas question to effect or hasten its overthrow its determination to restore friendly relation with the united states and to receive our minister to negotiate for the settlement of this question be violently assail and be make the great theme of denunciation against it the government of general herrera there be good reason to believe be sincerely desirous to receive our minister but it yield to the storm raise by its enemy and on the 21st of december refuse to accredit mr. slidell upon the most frivolous pretext these be so fully and ably expose in the note of mr. slidell of the 24th of december last to the mexican minister of foreign relation herewith transmit that i deem it unnecessary to enter into further detail on this portion of the subject
 five day after the date of mr. slidell&#39;s note general herrera yield the government to general paredes without a struggle and on the 30th of december resign the presidency this revolution be accomplish solely by the army the people having take little part in the contest and thus the supreme power in mexico pass into the hand of a military leader
 determine to leave no effort untried to effect an amicable adjustment with mexico i direct mr. slidell to present his credential to the government of general paredes and ask to be officially receive by he there would have be less ground for take this step have general paredes come into power by a regular constitutional succession in that event his administration would have be consider but a mere constitutional continuance of the government of general herrera and the refusal of the latter to receive our minister would have be deem conclusive unless an intimation have be give by general paredes of his desire to reverse the decision of his predecessor but the government of general paredes owe its existence to a military revolution by which the subsist constitutional authority have be subvert the form of government be entirely change as well as all the high functionary by whom it be administer
 under these circumstance mr. slidell in obedience to my direction address a note to the mexican minister of foreign relation under date of the 1st of march last ask to be receive by that government in the diplomatic character to which he have be appoint this minister in his reply under date of the 12th of march reiterate the argument of his predecessor and in term that may be consider as give just ground of offense to the government and people of the united states deny the application of mr. slidell nothing therefore remain for our envoy but to demand his passport and return to his own country
 thus the government of mexico though solemnly pledge by official act in october last to receive and accredit an american envoy violate their plight faith and refuse the offer of a peaceful adjustment of our difficulty not only be the offer reject but the indignity of its rejection be enhance by the manifest breach of faith in refuse to admit the envoy who come because they have bind themselves to receive he nor can it be say that the offer be fruitless from the want of opportunity of discuss it our envoy be present on their own soil nor can it be ascribe to a want of sufficient power our envoy have full power to adjust every question of difference nor be there room for complaint that our proposition for settlement be unreasonable permission be not even give our envoy to make any proposition whatever nor can it be object that we on our part would not listen to any reasonable term of their suggestion the mexican government refuse all negotiation and have make no proposition of any kind
 in my message at the commencement of the present session i inform you that upon the earnest appeal both of the congress and convention of texas i have order an efficient military force to take a position between the nueces and the del norte this have become necessary to meet a threatened invasion of texas by the mexican force for which extensive military preparation have be make the invasion be threaten solely because texas have determine in accordance with a solemn resolution of the congress of the united states to annex herself to our union and under these circumstance it be plainly our duty to extend our protection over her citizen and soil
 this force be concentrate at corpus christi and remain there until after i have receive such information from mexico as render it probable if not certain that the mexican government would refuse to receive our envoy
 meantime texas by the final action of our congress have become an integral part of our union the congress of texas by its act of december 19 1836 have declare the rio del norte to be the boundary of that republic its jurisdiction have be extend and exercise beyond the nueces the country between that river and the del norte have be represent in the congress and in the convention of texas have thus take part in the act of annexation itself and be now include within one of our congressional district our own congress have moreover with great unanimity by the act approve december 31 1845 recognize the country beyond the nueces as a part of our territory by include it within our own revenue system and a revenue officer to reside within that district have be appoint by and with the advice and consent of the senate it become therefore of urgent necessity to provide for the defense of that portion of our country accordingly on the 13th of january last instruction be issue to the general in command of these troop to occupy the left bank of the del norte this river which be the southwestern boundary of the state of texas be an exposed frontier from this quarter invasion be threaten upon it and in its immediate vicinity in the judgment of high military experience be the proper station for the protect force of the government in addition to this important consideration several other occur to induce this movement among these be the facility afford by the port at brazos santiago and the mouth of the del norte for the reception of supply by sea the strong and more healthful military position the convenience for obtain a ready and a more abundant supply of provision water fuel and forage and the advantage which be afford by the del norte in forward supply to such post as may be establish in the interior and upon the indian frontier
 the movement of the troop to the del norte be make by the command general under positive instruction to abstain from all aggressive act toward mexico or mexican citizen and to regard the relation between that republic and the united states as peaceful unless she should declare war or commit act of hostility indicative of a state of war he be specially direct to protect private property and respect personal right
 the army move from corpus christi on the 11th of march and on the 28th of that month arrive on the left bank of the del norte opposite to matamoras where it encamp on a commanding position which have since be strengthen by the erection of fieldwork a depot have also be establish at point isabel near the brazos santiago 30 mile in rear of the encampment the selection of his position be necessarily confide to the judgment of the general in command
 the mexican force at matamoras assume a belligerent attitude and on the 12th of april general ampudia then in command notify general taylor to break up his camp within twenty four hour and to retire beyond the nueces river and in the event of his failure to comply with these demand announce that arm and arm alone must decide the question but no open act of hostility be commit until the 24th of april on that day general arista who have succeed to the command of the mexican force communicate to general taylor that he consider hostility commence and should prosecute they a party of dragoon of 63 man and officer be on the same day dispatch from the american camp up the rio del norte on its left bank to ascertain whether the mexican troop have cross or be prepare to cross the river become engaged with a large body of these troop and after a short affair in which some 16 be kill and wound appear to have be surround and compel to surrender
 the grievous wrong perpetrate by mexico upon our citizen throughout a long period of year remain unredressed and solemn treaty pledge her public faith for this redress have be disregard a government either unable or unwilling to enforce the execution of such treaty fail to perform one of its plainest duty
 our commerce with mexico have be almost annihilate it be formerly highly beneficial to both nation but our merchant have be deter from prosecute it by the system of outrage and extortion which the mexican authority have pursue against they whilst their appeal through their own government for indemnity have be make in vain our forbearance have go to such an extreme as to be mistake in its character have we act with vigor in repel the insult and redress the injury inflict by mexico at the commencement we should doubtless have escape all the difficulty in which we be now involve
 instead of this however we have be exert our good effort to propitiate her good will upon the pretext that texas a nation as independent as herself think proper to unite its destiny with our own she have affect to believe that we have sever her rightful territory and in official proclamation and manifesto have repeatedly threaten to make war upon we for the purpose of reconquer texas in the meantime we have try every effort at reconciliation the cup of forbearance have be exhaust even before the recent information from the frontier of the del norte but now after reiterated menace mexico have pass the boundary of the united states have invade our territory and shed american blood upon the american soil she have proclaim that hostility have commence and that the two nation be now at war
 as war exist and notwithstanding all our effort to avoid it exist by the act of mexico herself we be call upon by every consideration of duty and patriotism to vindicate with decision the honor the right and the interest of our country
 anticipate the possibility of a crisis like that which have arrive instruction be give in august last as a precautionary measure against invasion or threatened invasion authorize general taylor if the emergency require to accept volunteer not from texas only but from the states of louisiana alabama mississippi tennessee and kentucky and corresponding letter be address to the respective governor of those states these instruction be repeat and in january last soon after the incorporation of texas into our union of states general taylor be far authorize by the president to make a requisition upon the executive of that state for such of its militia force as may be need to repel invasion or to secure the country against apprehended invasion on the 2d day of march he be again remind in the event of the approach of any considerable mexican force promptly and efficiently to use the authority with which he be clothe to call to he such auxiliary force as he might need war actually exist and our territory having be invade general taylor pursuant to authority vest in he by my direction have call on the governor of texas for four regiment of state troop two to be mount and two to serve on foot and on the governor of louisiana for four regiment of infantry to be send to he as soon as practicable
 in further vindication of our right and defense of our territory i invoke the prompt action of congress to recognize the existence of the war and to place at the disposition of the executive the mean of prosecute the war with vigor and thus hasten the restoration of peace to this end i recommend that authority should be give to call into the public service a large body of volunteer to serve for not less than six or twelve month unless soon discharge a volunteer force be beyond question more efficient than any other description of citizen soldier and it be not to be doubt that a number far beyond that require would readily rush to the field upon the call of their country i far recommend that a liberal provision be make for sustain our entire military force and furnish it with supply and munition of war
 the most energetic and prompt measure and the immediate appearance in arm of a large and overpowering force be recommend to congress as the most certain and efficient mean of bring the exist collision with mexico to a speedy and successful termination
 in make these recommendation i deem it proper to declare that it be my anxious desire not only to terminate hostility speedily but to bring all matter in dispute between this government and mexico to an early and amicable adjustment and in this view i shall be prepare to renew negotiation whenever mexico shall be ready to receive proposition or to make proposition of her own
 i transmit herewith a copy of the correspondence between our envoy to mexico and the mexican minister for foreign affair and so much of the correspondence between that envoy and the secretary of state and between the secretary of war and the general in command on the del norte as be necessary to a full understanding of the subject

by the president of the united states of america

to the senate of the united states
 i lie before the senate a proposal in the form of a convention present to the secretary of state on the 6th instant by the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of her britannic majesty for the adjustment of the oregon question together with a protocol of this proceeding i submit this proposal to the consideration of the senate and request their advice as to the action which in their judgment it may be proper to take in reference to it
 in the early period of the government the opinion and advice of the senate be often take in advance upon important question of our foreign policy general washington repeatedly consult the senate and ask their previous advice upon pende negotiation with foreign power and the senate in every instance respond to his call by give their advice to which he always conform his action this practice though rarely resort to in later time be in my judgment eminently wise and may on occasion of great importance be properly revive the senate be a branch of the treaty make power and by consult they in advance of his own action upon important measure of foreign policy which may ultimately come before they for their consideration the president secure harmony of action between that body and himself the senate be moreover a branch of the war make power and it may be eminently proper for the executive to take the opinion and advice of that body in advance upon any great question which may involve in its decision the issue of peace or war on the present occasion the magnitude of the subject would induce i under any circumstance to desire the previous advice of the senate and that desire be increase by the recent debate and proceeding in congress which render it in my judgment nor only respectful to the senate but necessary and proper if not indispensable to insure harmonious action between that body and the executive in confer on the executive the authority to give the notice for the abrogation of the convention of 1827 the senate act publicly so large a part that a decision on the proposal now make by the british government without a definite knowledge of the view of that body in reference to it might render the question still more complicated and difficult of adjustment for these reason i invite the consideration of the senate to the proposal of the british government for the settlement of the oregon question and ask their advice on the subject
 my opinion and my action on the oregon question be fully make known to congress in my annual message of the 2d of december last and the opinion therein express remain unchanged
 should the senate by the constitutional majority require for the ratification of treaty advise the acceptance of this proposition or advise it with such modification as they may upon full deliberation deem proper i shall conform my action to their advice should the senate however decline by such constitutional majority to give such advice or to express an opinion on the subject i shall consider it my duty to reject the offer
 i also communicate herewith an extract from a dispatch of the secretary of state to the minister of the united states at london under date of the 28th of april last direct he in accordance with the joint resolution of congress concern the oregon territory to deliver the notice to the british government for the abrogation of the convention of the 6th of august 1827 and also a copy of the notice transmit to he for that purpose together with extract from a dispatch of that minister to the secretary of state bear date on the 18th day of may last

to the house of representatives
 i have consider the bill entitle an act make appropriation for the improvement of certain harbor and river with the care which its importance demand and now return the same to the house of representatives in which it originate with my objection to its become a law the bill propose to appropriate $ 1,378,450 to be apply to more than forty distinct and separate object of improvement on examine its provision and the variety of object of improvement which it embrace many of they of a local character it be difficult to conceive if it shall be sanction and become a law what practical constitutional restraint can hereafter be impose upon the most extended system of internal improvement by the federal government in all part of the union the constitution have not in my judgment confer upon the federal government the power to construct work of internal improvement within the states or to appropriate money from the treasury for that purpose that this bill assume for the federal government the right to exercise this power can not i think be doubt the approved course of the government and the deliberately express judgment of the people have deny the existence of such a power under the constitution several of my predecessor have deny its existence in the most solemn form
 the general proposition that the federal government do not possess this power be so well settle and have for a considerable period be so generally acquiesce in that it be not deem necessary to reiterate the argument by which it be sustain nor do i deem it necessary after the full and elaborate discussion which have take place before the country on this subject to do more than to state the general consideration which have satisfy i of the unconstitutionality and inexpediency of the exercise of such a power
 it be not question that the federal government be one of limited power its power be such and such only as be expressly grant in the constitution or be properly incident to the expressly grant power and necessary to their execution in determine whether a give power have be grant a sound rule of construction have be lay down by mr. madison that rule be that--
 whenever a question arise concern a particular power the first question be whether the power be express in the constitution if it be the question be decide if it be not express the next inquiry must be whether it be properly an incident to an express power and necessary to its execution if it be it may be exercise by congress if it be not congress can not exercise it
 it be not pretend that there be any express grant in the constitution confer on congress the power in question be it then an incidental power necessary and proper for the execution of any of the grant power all the grant power it be confidently affirm may be effectually execute without the aid of such an incident a power to be incidental must not be exercise for end which make it a principal or substantive power independent of the principal power to which it be an incident it be not enough that it may be regard by congress as convenient or that its exercise would advance the public weal it must be necessary and proper to the execution of the principal express power to which it be an incident and without which such principal power can not be carry into effect the whole frame of the federal constitution prove that the government which it create be intend to be one of limited and specify power a construction of the constitution so broad as that by which the power in question be defend tend imperceptibly to a consolidation of power in a government intend by its framer to be thus limit in its authority the obvious tendency and inevitable result of a consolidation of the states into one sovereignty would be to transform the republican system of the united states into a monarchy to guard against the assumption of all power which encroach upon the reserved sovereignty of the states and which consequently tend to consolidation be the duty of all the true friend of our political system that the power in question be not properly an incident to any of the grant power i be fully satisfied but if there be doubt on this subject experience have demonstrate the wisdom of the rule that all the functionary of the federal government should abstain from the exercise of all questionable or doubtful power if an enlargement of the power of the federal government should be deem proper it be safe and wise to appeal to the states and the people in the mode prescribe by the constitution for the grant desire than to assume its exercise without an amendment of the constitution if congress do not possess the general power to construct work of internal improvement within the states or to appropriate money from the treasury for that purpose what be there to exempt some at least of the object of appropriation include in this bill from the operation of the general rule this bill assume the existence of the power and in some of its provision assert the principle that congress may exercise it as fully as though the appropriation which it propose be applicable to the construction of road and canal if there be a distinction in principle it be not perceive and should be clearly define some of the object of appropriation contain in this bill be local in their character and lie within the limit of a single state and though in the language of the bill they be call harbor they be not connect with foreign commerce nor be they place of refuge or shelter for our navy or commercial marine on the ocean or lake shore to call the mouth of a creek or a shallow inlet on our coast a harbor can not confer the authority to expend the public money in its improvement congress have exercise the power coeval with the constitution of establish light house beacon buoy and pier on our ocean and lake shore for the purpose of render navigation safe and easy and of afford protection and shelter for our navy and other shipping these be safeguard place in exist channel of navigation after the long acquiescence of the government through all precede administration i be not disposed to question or disturb the authority to make appropriation for such purpose
 when we advance a step beyond this point and in addition to the establishment and support by appropriation from the treasury of lighthouse beacon buoy pier and other improvement within the bay inlet and harbor on our ocean and lake coast immediately connect with our foreign commerce attempt to make improvement in the interior at point unconnected with foreign commerce and where they be not need for the protection and security of our navy and commercial marine the difficulty arise in draw a line beyond which appropriation may not be make by the federal government
 one of my predecessor who see the evil consequence of the system propose to be revive by this bill attempt to define this line by declare that expenditure of this character should be confine below the port of entry or delivery establish by law act on this restriction he withhold his sanction from a bill which have pass congress to improve the navigation of the wabash river he be at the same time sensible that this restriction be not as satisfactory as could be desire and that much embarrassment may be cause to the executive department in its execution by appropriation for remote and not well understand object this restriction it be soon find be subject to be evade and render comparatively useless in check the system of improvement which it be design to arrest in consequence of the facility with which port of entry and delivery may be establish by law upon the upper water and in some instance almost at the head spring of some of the most unimportant of our river and at point on our coast possess no commercial importance and not use as place of refuge and safety by our navy and other shipping many of the port of entry and delivery now authorize by law so far as foreign commerce be concern exist only in the statute book no entry of foreign good be ever make and no duty be ever collect at they no export of american product bind for foreign country ever clear from they to assume that their existence in the statute book as port of entry or delivery warrant expenditure on the water lead to they which would be otherwise unauthorized would be to assert the proposition that the lawmaking power may ingraft new provision on the constitution if the restriction be a sound one it can only apply to the bay inlet and river connect with or lead to such port as actually have foreign commerce port at which foreign importation arrive in bulk pay the duty charge by law and from which export be make to foreign country it will be find by apply the restriction thus understand to the bill under consideration that it contain appropriation for more than twenty object of internal improvement call in the bill harbor at place which have never be declare by law either port of entry or delivery and at which as appear from the record of the treasury there have never be an arrival of foreign merchandise and from which there have never be a vessel clear for a foreign country it will be find that many of these work be new and at place for the improvement of which appropriation be now for the first time propose it will be find also that the bill contain appropriation for river upon which there not only exist no foreign commerce but upon which there have not be establish even a paper port of entry and for the mouth of creek denominated harbor which if improve can benefit only the particular neighborhood in which they be situate it will be find too to contain appropriation the expenditure of which will only have the effect of improve one place at the expense of the local natural advantage of another in its vicinity should this bill become a law the same principle which authorize the appropriation which it propose to make would also authorize similar appropriation for the improvement of all the other bay inlet and creek which may with equal propriety be call harbor and of all the river important or unimportant in every part of the union to sanction the bill with such provision would be to concede the principle that the federal government possess the power to expend the public money in a general system of internal improvement limit in its extent only by the ever vary discretion of successive congresses and successive executive it would be to efface and remove the limitation and restriction of power which the constitution have wisely provide to limit the authority and action of the federal government to a few well define and specified object besides these objection the practical evil which must flow from the exercise on the part of the federal government of the power assert in this bill impress my mind with a grave sense of my duty to avert they from the country as far as my constitutional action may enable i to do so
 it not only lead to a consolidation of power in the federal government at the expense of the rightful authority of the states but its inevitable tendency be to embrace object for the expenditure of the public money which be local in their character benefit but few at the expense of the common treasury of the whole it will engender sectional feeling and prejudice calculate to disturb the harmony of the union it will destroy the harmony which should prevail in our legislative council
 it will produce combination of local and sectional interest strong enough when unite to carry proposition for appropriation of public money which could not of themselves and stand alone succeed and can not fail to lead to wasteful and extravagant expenditure
 it must produce a disreputable scramble for the public money by the conflict which be inseparable from such a system between local and individual interest and the general interest of the whole it be unjust to those states which have with their own mean construct their own internal improvement to make from the common treasury appropriation for similar improvement in other states
 in its operation it will be oppressive and unjust toward those states whose representative and people either deny or doubt the existence of the power or think its exercise inexpedient and who while they equally contribute to the treasury can not consistently with their opinion engage in a general competition for a share of the public money thus a large portion of the union in number and in geographical extent contribute its equal proportion of taxis to the support of the government would under the operation of such a system be compel to see the national treasure the common stock of all unequally disburse and often improvidently waste for the advantage of small section instead of be apply to the great national purpose in which all have a common interest and for which alone the power to collect the revenue be give should the system of internal improvement propose prevail all these evil will multiply and increase with the increase of the number of the states and the extension of the geographical limit of the settle portion of our country with the increase of our number and the extension of our settlement the local object demand appropriation of the public money for their improvement will be proportionately increase in each case the expenditure of the public money would confer benefit direct or indirect only on a section while these section would become daily less in comparison with the whole
 the wisdom of the framer of the constitution in withholding power over such object from the federal government and leave they to the local government of the states become more and more manifest with every year&#39;s experience of the operation of our system
 in a country of limited extent with but few such object of expenditure if the form of government permit it a common treasury might be use for their improvement with much less inequality and injustice than in one of the vast extent which our now present in population and territory the treasure of the world would hardly be equal to the improvement of every bay inlet creek and river in our country which might be suppose to promote the agricultural manufacturing or commercial interest of a neighborhood
 the federal constitution be wisely adapt in its provision to any expansion of our limit and population and with the advance of the confederacy of the states in the career of national greatness it become the more apparent that the harmony of the union and the equal justice to which all its part be entitle require that the federal government should confine its action within the limit prescribe by the constitution to its power and authority some of the provision of this bill be not subject to the objection state and do they stand alone i should not feel it to be my duty to withhold my approval
 if no constitutional objection exist to the bill there be other of a serious nature which deserve some consideration it appropriate between $ 1,000,000 and $ 2,000,000 for object which be of no press necessity and this be propose at a time when the country be engage in a foreign war and when congress at its present session have authorize a loan or the issue of treasury note to defray the expense of the war to be resort to if the exigency of the government shall require it it would seem to be the dictate of wisdom under such circumstance to husband our mean and not to waste they on comparatively unimportant object so that we may reduce the loan or issue of treasury note which may become necessary to the small practicable sum it would seem to be wise too to abstain from such expenditure with a view to avoid the accumulation of a large public debt the existence of which would be oppose to the interest of our people as well as to the genius of our free institution
 should this bill become a law the principle which it establish will inevitably lead to large and annually increase appropriation and drain upon the treasury for it be not to be doubt that numerous other locality not embrace in its provision but quite as much entitle to the favor of the government as those which be embrace will demand through their representative in congress to be place on an equal footing with they with such an increase of expenditure must necessarily follow either an increase public debt or increase burden upon the people by taxation to supply the treasury with the mean of meet the accumulate demand upon it
 with profound respect for the opinion of congress and ever anxious as far as i can consistently with my responsibility to our common constituent to cooperate with they in the discharge of our respective duty it be with unfeigned regret that i find myself constrain for the reason which i have assign to withhold my approval from this bill

to the senate and house of representatives of the united states
 i communicate herewith a copy of a convention for the settlement and adjustment of the oregon question which be conclude in this city on the 15th day of june last between the united states and her britannic majesty this convention have since be duly ratify by the respective party and the ratification be exchange at london on the 17th day of july 1846
 it now become important that provision should be make by law at the early practicable period for the organization of a territorial government in oregon
 it be also deem proper that our law regulate trade and intercourse with the indian tribe east of the rocky mountains should be extend to such tribe within our territory as dwell beyond they and that a suitable number of indian agent should be appoint for the purpose of carry these law into execution
 it be likewise important that mail facility so indispensable for the diffusion of information and for bind together the different portion of our extended confederacy should be afford to our citizen west of the rocky mountains
 there be another subject to which i desire to call your special attention it be of great importance to our country generally and especially to our navigating and whale interest that the pacific coast and indeed the whole of our territory west of the rocky mountains should speedily be fill up by a hardy and patriotic population emigrant to that territory have many difficulty to encounter and privation to endure in their long and perilous journey and by the time they reach their place of destination their pecuniary mean be generally much reduce if not altogether exhaust under these circumstance it be deem but an act of justice that these emigrant whilst most effectually advance the interest and policy of the government should be aid by liberal grant of land i would therefore recommend that such grant be make to actual settler upon the term and under the restriction and limitation which congress may think advisable

to the senate of the united states
 i transmit herewith for the consideration and constitutional action of the senate article of a treaty which have be conclude by the commissioner appoint for the purpose with the different party into which the cherokee tribe of indians have be divide through their delegate now in washington the same commissioner have previously be appoint to investigate the subject of the difficulty which have for year exist among the cherokees and which have keep they in a state of constant excitement and almost entirely interrupt all progress on their part in civilization and improvement in agriculture and the mechanic art and have lead to many unfortunate act of domestic strife against which the government be bind by the treaty of 1835 to protect they their unfortunate internal dissension have attract the notice and excite the sympathy of the whole country and it become evident that if something be not do to heal they they would terminate in a sanguinary war in which other tribe of indians might become involved and the life and property of our own citizen on the frontier endanger i recommend in my message to congress on the 13th of april last such measure as i then think it expedient should be adopt to restore peace and good order among the cherokees one of which be a division of the country which they occupy and separation of the tribe this recommendation be make under the belief that the different faction could not be reconcile and live together in harmony a belief base in a great degree upon the representation of the delegate of the two division of the tribe since then however there appear to have be a change of opinion on this subject on the part of these division of the tribe and on representation be make to i that by the appointment of commissioner to hear and investigate the cause of grievance of the party against each other and to examine into their claim against the government it would probably be find that an arrangement could be make which would once more harmonize the tribe and adjust in a satisfactory manner their claim upon and relation with the united states i do not hesitate to appoint three person for the purpose the commissioner enter into an able and laborious investigation and on their making know to i the probability of their be able to conclude a new treaty with the delegate of all the division of the tribe who be fully empower to make any new arrangement which would heal all dissension among the cherokees and restore they to their ancient condition of peace and good brotherhood i authorize and appoint they to enter into negotiation with these delegate for the accomplishment of that object the treaty now transmit be the result of their labor and it be hope that it will meet the approbation of congress and if carry out in good faith by all party to it it be believe it will effect the great and desirable end have in view
 accompany the treaty be the report of the commissioner and also a communication to they from john ross and other who represent what be term the government party of the cherokees and which be transmit at their request for the consideration of the senate
 it be say that serious apprehension be to some extent entertain in which i do not share that the peace of this district may be disturb before the 4th of march next in any event it will be my duty to preserve it and this duty shall be perform
 in conclusion it may be permit to i to remark that i have often warn my countryman of the danger which now surround we this may be the last time i shall refer to the subject officially i feel that my duty have be faithfully though it may be imperfectly perform and whatever the result may be i shall carry to my grave the consciousness that i at least mean well for my country

to the senate and house of representatives of the united states
 i invite your attention to the propriety of make an appropriation to provide for any expenditure which it may be necessary to make in advance for the purpose of settle all our difficulty with the mexican republic it be my sincere desire to terminate as it be originally to avoid the exist war with mexico by a peace just and honorable to both party it be probable that the chief obstacle to be surmount in accomplish this desirable object will be the adjustment of a boundary between the two republic which shall prove satisfactory and convenient to both and such as neither will hereafter be incline to disturb in the adjustment of this boundary we ought to pay a fair equivalent for any concession which may be make by mexico
 under these circumstance and consider the other complicated question to be settle by negotiation with the mexican republic i deem it important that a sum of money should be place under the control of the executive to be advance if need be to the government of that republic immediately after their ratification of a treaty it might be inconvenient for the mexican government to wait for the whole sum the payment of which may be stipulate by this treaty until it could be ratify by our senate and an appropriation to carry it into effect make by congress indeed the necessity for this delay might defeat the object altogether the disbursement of this money would of course be account for not as secret service money but like other expenditure
 two precedent for such a proceeding exist in our past history during the administration of mr. jefferson to which i would call your attention on the 26th february 1803 an act be pass appropriate $ 2,000,000 for the purpose of defray any extraordinary expense which may be incur in the intercourse between the united states and foreign nation to be apply under the direction of the president of the united states who shall cause an account of the expenditure thereof to be lay before congress as soon as may be and on the 13th of february 1806 an appropriation be make of the same amount and in the same term in neither case be the money actually draw from the treasury and i should hope that the result in this respect might be similar on the present occasion although the appropriation may prove to be indispensable in accomplish the object i would therefore recommend the passage of a law appropriate $ 2,000,000 to be place at the disposal of the executive for the purpose which i have indicate
 in order to prevent all misapprehension it be my duty to state that anxious as i be to terminate the exist war with the least possible delay it will continue to be prosecute with the utmost vigor until a treaty of peace shall be sign by the party and ratify by the mexican republic

fellow citizen of the senate and of the house of representatives
 in resume your labor in the service of the people it be a subject of congratulation that there have be no period in our past history when all the element of national prosperity have be so fully develop since your last session no afflict dispensation have visit our country general good health have prevail abundance have crown the toil of the husbandman and labor in all its branch be receive an ample reward while education science and the art be rapidly enlarge the mean of social happiness the progress of our country in her career of greatness not only in the vast extension of our territorial limit and the rapid increase of our population but in resource and wealth and in the happy condition of our people be without an example in the history of nation
 as the wisdom strength and beneficence of our free institution be unfold every day add fresh motive to contentment and fresh incentive to patriotism
 our devout and sincere acknowledgment be due to the gracious giver of all good for the numberless blessing which our beloved country enjoy
 it be a source of high satisfaction to know that the relation of the united states with all other nation with a single exception be of the most amicable character sincerely attach to the policy of peace early adopt and steadily pursue by this government i have anxiously desire to cultivate and cherish friendship and commerce with every foreign power the spirit and habit of the american people be favorable to the maintenance of such international harmony in adhere to this wise policy a preliminary and paramount duty obviously consist in the protection of our national interest from encroachment or sacrifice and our national honor from reproach these must be maintain at any hazard they admit of no compromise or neglect and must be scrupulously and constantly guard in their vigilant vindication collision and conflict with foreign power may sometimes become unavoidable such have be our scrupulous adherence to the dictate of justice in all our foreign intercourse that though steadily and rapidly advance in prosperity and power we have give no just cause of complaint to any nation and have enjoy the blessing of peace for more than thirty year from a policy so sacred to humanity and so salutary in its effect upon our political system we should never be induce voluntarily to depart
 the exist war with mexico be neither desire nor provoke by the united states on the contrary all honorable mean be resort to avert it after year of endurance of aggravate and unredressed wrong on our part mexico in violation of solemn treaty stipulation and of every principle of justice recognize by civilized nation commenced hostility and thus by her own act force the war upon we long before the advance of our army to the left bank of the rio grande we have ample cause of war against mexico and have the united states resort to this extremity we might have appeal to the whole civilized world for the justice of our cause i deem it to be my duty to present to you on the present occasion a condensed review of the injury we have sustain of the cause which lead to the war and of its progress since its commencement this be render the more necessary because of the misapprehension which have to some extent prevail as to its origin and true character the war have be represent as unjust and unnecessary and as one of aggression on our part upon a weak and injured enemy such erroneous view though entertain by but few have be widely and extensively circulate not only at home but have be spread throughout mexico and the whole world a more effectual mean could not have be devise to encourage the enemy and protract the war than to advocate and adhere to their cause and thus give they aid and comfort it be a source of national pride and exultation that the great body of our people have throw no such obstacle in the way of the government in prosecute the war successfully but have show themselves to be eminently patriotic and ready to vindicate their country&#39; honor and interest at any sacrifice the alacrity and promptness with which our volunteer force rush to the field on their country&#39; call prove not only their patriotism but their deep conviction that our cause be just
 the wrong which we have suffer from mexico almost ever since she become an independent power and the patient endurance with which we have bear they be without a parallel in the history of modern civilized nation there be reason to believe that if these wrong have be resent and resist in the first instance the present war might have be avoid one outrage however permit to pass with impunity almost necessarily encourage the perpetration of another until at last mexico seem to attribute to weakness and indecision on our part a forbearance which be the offspring of magnanimity and of a sincere desire to preserve friendly relation with a sister republic
 scarcely have mexico achieve her independence which the united states be the first among the nation to acknowledge when she commence the system of insult and spoliation which she have ever since pursue our citizen engage in lawful commerce be imprison their vessel seize and our flag insult in her port if money be want the lawless seizure and confiscation of our merchant vessel and their cargo be a ready resource and if to accomplish their purpose it become necessary to imprison the owner captain and crew it be do ruler supersede ruler in mexico in rapid succession but still there be no change in this system of depredation the government of the united states make repeat reclamation on behalf of its citizen but these be answer by the perpetration of new outrage promise of redress make by mexico in the most solemn form be postpone or evade the file and record of the department of state contain conclusive proof of numerous lawless act perpetrate upon the property and person of our citizen by mexico and of wanton insult to our national flag the interposition of our government to obtain redress be again and again invoke under circumstance which no nation ought to disregard it be hope that these outrage would cease and that mexico would be restrain by the law which regulate the conduct of civilized nation in their intercourse with each other after the treaty of amity commerce and navigation of the 5th of april 1831 be conclude between the two republic but this hope soon prove to be vain the course of seizure and confiscation of the property of our citizen the violation of their person and the insult to our flag pursue by mexico previous to that time be scarcely suspend for even a brief period although the treaty so clearly define the right and duty of the respective party that it be impossible to misunderstand or mistake they in less than seven year after the conclusion of that treaty our grievance have become so intolerable that in the opinion of president jackson they should no long be endure in his message to congress in february 1837 he present they to the consideration of that body and declare that--
 the length of time since some of the injury have be commit the repeat and unavaile application for redress the wanton character of some of the outrage upon the property and person of our citizen upon the officer and flag of the united states independent of recent insult to this government and people by the late extraordinary mexican minister would justify in the eye of all nation immediate war
 in a spirit of kindness and forbearance however he recommend reprisal as a milder mode of redress he declare that war should not be use as a remedy by just and generous nation confide in their strength for injury commit if it can be honorably avoid and add
 it have occur to i that consider the present embarrassed condition of that country we should act with both wisdom and moderation by give to mexico one more opportunity to atone for the past before we take redress into our own hand to avoid all misconception on the part of mexico as well as to protect our own national character from reproach this opportunity should be give with the avow design and full preparation to take immediate satisfaction if it should not be obtain on a repetition of the demand for it to this end i recommend that an act be pass authorize reprisal and the use of the naval force of the united states by the executive against mexico to enforce they in the event of a refusal by the mexican government to come to an amicable adjustment of the matter in controversy between we upon another demand thereof make from on board out of our vessel of war on the coast of mexico
 committee of both houses of congress to which this message of the president be refer fully sustain his view of the character of the wrong which we have suffer from mexico and recommend that another demand for redress should be make before authorize war or reprisal the committee on foreign relations of the senate in their report say
 after such a demand should prompt justice be refuse by the mexican government we may appeal to all nation not only for the equity and moderation with which we shall have act toward a sister republic but for the necessity which will then compel we to seek redress for our wrong either by actual war or by reprisal the subject will then be present before congress at the commencement of the next session in a clear and distinct form and the committee can not doubt but that such measure will be immediately adopt as may be necessary to vindicate the honor of the country and insure ample reparation to our injure fellow citizen
 the committee on foreign affairs of the house of representatives make a similar recommendation in their report they say that--
 they fully concur with the president that ample cause exist for take redress into our own hand and believe that we should be justify in the opinion of other nation for take such a step but they be willing to try the experiment of another demand make in the most solemn form upon the justice of the mexican government before any further proceeding be adopt
 no difference of opinion upon the subject be believe to have exist in congress at that time the executive and legislative department concur and yet such have be our forbearance and desire to preserve peace with mexico that the wrong of which we then complain and which give rise to these solemn proceeding not only remain unredressed to this day but additional cause of complaint of an aggravated character have ever since be accumulate shortly after these proceeding a special messenger be dispatch to mexico to make a final demand for redress and on the 20th of july 1837 the demand be make the reply of the mexican government bear date on the 29th of the same month and contain assurance of the anxious wish of the mexican government not to delay the moment of that final and equitable adjustment which be to terminate the exist difficulty between the two government that nothing should be leave undo which may contribute to the most speedy and equitable determination of the subject which have so seriously engage the attention of the american government that the mexican government would adopt as the only guide for its conduct the plain principle of public right the sacred obligation impose by international law and the religious faith of treaty and that whatever reason and justice may dictate respect each case will be do the assurance be far give that the decision of the mexican government upon each cause of complaint for which redress have be demand should be communicate to the government of the united states by the mexican minister at washington
 these solemn assurance in answer to our demand for redress be disregard by make they however mexico obtain further delay president van buren in his annual message to congress of the 5th of december 1837 state that although the large number of our demand for redress and many of they aggravate case of personal wrong have be now for year before the mexican government and some of the cause of national complaint and those of the most offensive character admit of immediate simple and satisfactory reply it be only within a few day past that any specific communication in answer to our last demand make five month ago have be receive from the mexican minister and that for not one of our public complaint have satisfaction be give or offer that but one of the case of personal wrong have be favorably consider and that but four case of both description out of all those formally present and earnestly pressed have as yet be decide upon by the mexican government president van buren believe that it would be vain to make any further attempt to obtain redress by the ordinary mean within the power of the executive communicate this opinion to congress in the message refer to in which he say
 on a careful and deliberate examination of their content of the correspondence with the mexican government and consider the spirit manifest by the mexican government it have become my painful duty to return the subject as it now stand to congress to whom it belong to decide upon the time the mode and the measure of redress
 have the united states at that time adopt compulsory measure and take redress into their own hand all our difficulty with mexico would probably have be long since adjust and the exist war have be avert magnanimity and moderation on our part only have the effect to complicate these difficulty and render an amicable settlement of they the more embarrassing that such measure of redress under similar provocation commit by any of the powerful nation of europe would have be promptly resort to by the united states can not be doubt the national honor and the preservation of the national character throughout the world as well as our own self respect and the protection due to our own citizen would have render such a resort indispensable the history of no civilized nation in modern time have present within so brief a period so many wanton attack upon the honor of its flag and upon the property and person of its citizen as have at that time be bear by the united states from the mexican authority and people but mexico be a sister republic on the north american continent occupy a territory contiguous to our own and be in a feeble and distracted condition and these consideration it be presume induce congress to forbear still long
 instead of take redress into our own hand a new negotiation be enter upon with fair promise on the part of mexico but with the real purpose as the event have prove of indefinitely postpone the reparation which we demand and which be so justly due this negotiation after more than a year&#39; delay result in the convention of the 11th of april 1839 for the adjustment of claim of citizen of the united states of america upon the government of the mexican republic the joint board of commissioner create by this convention to examine and decide upon these claim be not organize until the month of august 1840 and under the term of the convention they be to terminate their duty within eighteen month from that time four of the eighteen month be consume in preliminary discussion on frivolous and dilatory point raise by the mexican commissioner and it be not until the month of december 1840 that they commence the examination of the claim of our citizen upon mexico fourteen month only remain to examine and decide upon these numerous and complicated case in the month of february 1842 the term of the commission expire leave many claim undisposed of for want of time the claim which be allow by the board and by the umpire authorize by the convention to decide in case of disagreement between the mexican and american commissioner amount to $ 2,026,139.68 there be pende before the umpire when the commission expire additional claim which have be examine and award by the american commissioner and have not be allow by the mexican commissioner amount to $ 928,627.88 upon which he do not decide allege that his authority have cease with the termination of the joint commission besides these claim there be other of american citizen amount to $ 3,336,837.05 which have be submit to the board and upon which they have not time to decide before their final adjournment
 the sum of $ 2,026,139.68 which have be award to the claimant be a liquidated and ascertain debt due by mexico about which there could be no dispute and which she be bind to pay accord to the term of the convention soon after the final award for this amount have be make the mexican government ask for a postponement of the time of make payment allege that it would be inconvenient to make the payment at the time stipulate in the spirit of forbear kindness toward a sister republic which mexico have so long abuse the united states promptly comply with her request a second convention be accordingly conclude between the two government on the 30th of january 1843 which upon its face declare that this new arrangement be enter into for the accommodation of mexico by the term of this convention all the interest due on the award which have be make in favor of the claimant under the convention of the 11th of april 1839 be to be pay to they on the 30th of april 1843 and the principal of the say award and the interest accrue thereon be stipulate to be pay in five year in equal installment every three month notwithstanding this new convention be enter into at the request of mexico and for the purpose of relieve she from embarrassment the claimant have only receive the interest due on the 30th of april 1843 and three of the twenty installment although the payment of the sum thus liquidate and confessedly due by mexico to our citizen as indemnity for acknowledge act of outrage and wrong be secure by treaty the obligation of which be ever hold sacred by all just nation yet mexico have violate this solemn engagement by fail and refuse to make the payment the two installment due in april and july 1844 under the peculiar circumstance connect with they have be assume by the united states and discharge to the claimant but they be still due by mexico but this be not all of which we have just cause of complaint to provide a remedy for the claimant whose case be not decide by the joint commission under the convention of april 11 1839 it be expressly stipulate by the sixth article of the convention of the 30th of january 1843 that--
 a new convention shall be enter into for the settlement of all claim of the government and citizen of the united states against the republic of mexico which be not finally decide by the late commission which meet in the city of washington and of all claim of the government and citizen of mexico against the united states
 in conformity with this stipulation a third convention be conclude and sign at the city of mexico on the 20th of november 1843 by the plenipotentiary of the two government by which provision be make for ascertain and pay these claim in january 1844 this convention be ratify by the senate of the united states with two amendment which be manifestly reasonable in their character upon a reference of the amendment propose to the government of mexico the same evasion difficulty and delay be interpose which have so long mark the policy of that government toward the united states it have not even yet decide whether it would or would not accede to they although the subject have be repeatedly press upon its consideration mexico have thus violate a second time the faith of treaty by fail or refuse to carry into effect the sixth article of the convention of january 1843
 such be the history of the wrong which we have suffer and patiently endure from mexico through a long series of year so far from afford reasonable satisfaction for the injury and insult we have bear a great aggravation of they consist in the fact that while the united states anxious to preserve a good understanding with mexico have be constantly but vainly employ in seek redress for past wrong new outrage be constantly occur which have continue to increase our cause of complaint and to swell the amount of our demand while the citizen of the united states be conduct a lawful commerce with mexico under the guaranty of a treaty of amity commerce and navigation many of they have suffer all the injury which would have result from open war this treaty instead of afford protection to our citizen have be the mean of invite they into the port of mexico that they might be as they have be in numerous instance plunder of their property and deprive of their personal liberty if they dare insist on their right have the unlawful seizure of american property and the violation of the personal liberty of our citizen to say nothing of the insult to our flag which have occur in the port of mexico take place on the high sea they would themselves long since have constitute a state of actual war between the two country in so long suffer mexico to violate her most solemn treaty obligation plunder our citizen of their property and imprison their person without afford they any redress we have fail to perform one of the first and high duty which every government owe to its citizen and the consequence have be that many of they have be reduce from a state of affluence to bankruptcy the proud name of american citizen which ought to protect all who bear it from insult and injury throughout the world have afford no such protection to our citizen in mexico we have ample cause of war against mexico long before the breaking out of hostility but even then we forbear to take redress into our own hand until mexico herself become the aggressor by invade our soil in hostile array and shed the blood of our citizen
 such be the grave cause of complaint on the part of the united states against mexico cause which exist long before the annexation of texas to the american union and yet animate by the love of peace and a magnanimous moderation we do not adopt those measure of redress which under such circumstance be the justify resort of injure nation
 the annexation of texas to the united states constitute no just cause of offense to mexico the pretext that it do so be wholly inconsistent and irreconcilable with well authenticate fact connect with the revolution by which texas become independent of mexico that this may be the more manifest it may be proper to advert to the cause and to the history of the principal event of that revolution
 texas constitute a portion of the ancient province of louisiana cede to the united states by france in the year 1803 in the year 1819 the united states by the florida treaty cede to spain all that part of louisiana within the present limit of texas and mexico by the revolution which separate she from spain and render she an independent nation succeed to the right of the mother country over this territory in the year 1824 mexico establish a federal constitution under which the mexican republic be compose of a number of sovereign states confederate together in a federal union similar to our own each of these states have its own executive legislature and judiciary and for all except federal purpose be as independent of the general government and that of the other states as be pennsylvania or virginia under our constitution texas and coahuila unite and form one of these mexican states the state constitution which they adopt and which be approve by the mexican confederacy assert that they be free and independent of the other mexican united states and of every other power and dominion whatsoever and proclaim the great principle of human liberty that the sovereignty of the state reside originally and essentially in the general mass of the individual who compose it to the government under this constitution as well as to that under the federal constitution the people of texas owe allegiance
 emigrant from foreign country include the united states be invite by the colonization law of the state and of the federal government to settle in texas advantageous term be offer to induce they to leave their own country and become mexican citizen this invitation be accept by many of our citizen in the full faith that in their new home they would be govern by law enact by representative elect by themselves and that their life liberty and property would be protect by constitutional guaranty similar to those which exist in the republic they have leave under a government thus organize they continue until the year 1835 when a military revolution break out in the city of mexico which entirely subvert the federal and state constitution and place a military dictator at the head of the government by a sweeping decree of a congress subservient to the will of the dictator the several state constitution be abolish and the states themselves convert into mere department of the central government the people of texas be unwilling to submit to this usurpation resistance to such tyranny become a high duty texas be fully absolve from all allegiance to the central government of mexico from the moment that government have abolish her state constitution and in its place substitute an arbitrary and despotic central government such be the principal cause of the texan revolution the people of texas at once determine upon resistance and fly to arm in the midst of these important and exciting event however they do not omit to place their liberty upon a secure and permanent foundation they elect member to a convention who in the month of march 1836 issue a formal declaration that their political connection with the mexican nation have forever end and that the people of texas do now constitute a free sovereign and independent republic and be fully invest with all the right and attribute which properly belong to independent nation they also adopt for their government a liberal republican constitution about the same time santa anna then the dictator of mexico invade texas with a numerous army for the purpose of subdue her people and enforce obedience to his arbitrary and despotic government on the 21st of april 1836 he be meet by the texan citizen soldier and on that day be achieve by they the memorable victory of san jacinto by which they conquer their independence consider the number engage on the respective side history do not record a more brilliant achievement santa anna himself be among the captive
 in the month of may 1836 santa anna acknowledge by a treaty with the texan authority in the most solumn form the full entire and perfect independence of the republic of texas it be true he be then a prisoner of war but it be equally true that he have fail to reconquer texas and have meet with signal defeat that his authority have not be revoke and that by virtue of this treaty he obtain his personal release by it hostility be suspend and the army which have invade texas under his command return in pursuance of this arrangement unmoleste to mexico
 from the day that the battle of san jacinto be fight until the present hour mexico have never possess the power to reconquer texas in the language of the secretary of state of the united states in a dispatch to our minister in mexico under date of the 8th of july 1842
 mexico may have choose to consider and may still choose to consider texas as having be at all time since 1835 and as still continue a rebellious province but the world have be oblige to take a very different view of the matter from the time of the battle of san jacinto in april 1836 to the present moment texas have exhibit the same external sign of national independence as mexico herself and with quite as much stability of government practically free and independent acknowledge as a political sovereignty by the principal power of the world no hostile foot find rest within her territory for six or seven year and mexico herself refrain for all that period from any further attempt to reestablish her own authority over that territory it can not but be surprising to find mr. de bocanegra the secretary of foreign affair of mexico complain that for that whole period citizen of the united states or its government have be favor the rebel of texas and supply they with vessel ammunition and money as if the war for the reduction of the province of texas have be constantly prosecute by mexico and her success prevent by these influence from abroad
 in the same dispatch the secretary of state affirm that--
 since 1837 the united states have regard texas as an independent sovereignty as much as mexico and that trade and commerce with citizen of a government at war with mexico can not on that account be regard as an intercourse by which assistance and succor be give to mexican rebel the whole current of mr. de bocanegra&#39;s remark run in the same direction as if the independence of texas have not be acknowledge it have be acknowledge it be acknowledge in 1837 against the remonstrance and protest of mexico and most of the act of any importance of which mr. de bocanegra complain flow necessarily from that recognition he speak of texas as still be an integral part of the territory of the mexican republic but he can not but understand that the united states do not so regard it the real complaint of mexico therefore be in substance neither more nor less than a complaint against the recognition of texan independence it may be think rather late to repeat that complaint and not quite just to confine it to the united states to the exemption of england france and belgium unless the united states having be the first to acknowledge the independence of mexico herself be to be blame for set an example for the recognition of that of texas
 and he add that--
 the constitution public treaty and the law oblige the president to regard texas as an independent state and its territory as no part of the territory of mexico
 texas have be an independent state with an organized government defy the power of mexico to overthrow or reconquer she for more than ten year before mexico commence the present war against the united states texas have give such evidence to the world of her ability to maintain her separate existence as an independent nation that she have be formally recognize as such not only by the united states but by several of the principal power of europe these power have enter into treaty of amity commerce and navigation with she they have receive and accredit her minister and other diplomatic agent at their respective court and they have commission minister and diplomatic agent on their part to the government of texas if mexico notwithstanding all this and her utter inability to subdue or reconquer texas still stubbornly refuse to recognize she as an independent nation she be none the less so on that account mexico herself have be recognize as an independent nation by the united states and by other power many year before spain of which before her revolution she have be a colony would agree to recognize she as such and yet mexico be at that time in the estimation of the civilized world and in fact none the less an independent power because spain still claim she as a colony if spain have continue until the present period to assert that mexico be one of her colony in rebellion against she this would not have make she so or change the fact of her independent existence texas at the period of her annexation to the united states bear the same relation to mexico that mexico have bear to spain for many year before spain acknowledge her independence with this important difference that before the annexation of texas to the united states be consummate mexico herself by a formal act of her government have acknowledge the independence of texas as a nation it be true that in the act of recognition she prescribe a condition which she have no power or authority to impose that texas should not annex herself to any other power but this could not detract in any degree from the recognition which mexico then make of her actual independence upon this plain statement of fact it be absurd for mexico to allege as a pretext for commence hostility against the united states that texas be still a part of her territory
 but there be those who concede all this to be true assume the ground that the true western boundary of texas be the nueces instead of the rio grande and that therefore in march our army to the east bank of the latter river we pass the texan line and invade the territory of mexico a simple statement of fact know to exist will conclusively refute such an assumption texas as cede to the united states by france in 1803 have be always claim as extend west to the rio grande or rio bravo this fact be establish by the authority of our most eminent statesman at a period when the question be as well if not well understand than it be at present during mr. jefferson&#39;s administration messrs. monroe and pinckney who have be send on a special mission to madrid charge among other thing with the adjustment of boundary between the two country in a note address to the spanish minister of foreign affair under date of the 28th of january 1805 assert that the boundary of louisiana as cede to the united states by france be the river perdido on the east and the river bravo on the west and they add that the fact and principle which justify this conclusion be so satisfactory to our government as to convince it that the united states have not a well right to the island of new orleans under the cession refer to than they have to the whole district of territory which be above describe down to the conclusion of the florida treaty in february 1819 by which this territory be cede to spain the united states assert and maintain their territorial right to this extent in the month of june 1818 during mr. monroe&#39;s administration information having be receive that a number of foreign adventurer have land at galveston with the avow purpose of form a settlement in that vicinity a special messenger be dispatch by the government of the united states with instruction from the secretary of state to warn they to desist should they be find there or any other place north of the rio bravo and within the territory claim by the united states he be instruct should they be find in the country north of that river to make known to they the surprise with which the president have see possession thus take without authority from the united states of a place within their territorial limit and upon which no lawful settlement can be make without their sanction he be instruct to call upon they to avow under what national authority they profess to act and to give they due warning that the place be within the united states who will suffer no permanent settlement to be make there under any authority other than their own as late as the 8th of july 1842 the secretary of state of the united states in a note address to our minister in mexico maintain that by the florida treaty of 1819 the territory as far west as the rio grande be confirm to spain in that note he state that--
 by the treaty of the 22d of february 1819 between the united states and spain the sabine be adopt as the line of boundary between the two power up to that period no considerable colonization have be effect in texas but the territory between the sabine and the rio grande be confirm to spain by the treaty application be make to that power for grant of land and such grant or permission of settlement be in fact make by the spanish authority in favor of citizen of the united states propose to emigrate to texas in numerous family before the declaration of independence by mexico
 the texas which be cede to spain by the florida treaty of 1819 embrace all the country now claim by the state of texas between the nueces and the rio grande the republic of texas always claim this river as her western boundary and in her treaty make with santa anna in may 1836 he recognize it as such by the constitution which texas adopt in march 1836 senatorial and representative district be organize extend west of the nueces the congress of texas on the 19th of december 1836 pass an act to define the boundary of the republic of texas in which they declare the rio grande from its mouth to its source to be their boundary and by the say act they extend their civil and political jurisdiction over the country up to that boundary during a period of more than nine year which intervene between the adoption of her constitution and her annexation as one of the states of our union texas assert and exercise many act of sovereignty and jurisdiction over the territory and inhabitant west of the nueces she organize and define the limit of county extend to the rio grande she establish court of justice and extend her judicial system over the territory she establish a custom house and collect duty and also post office and post road in it she establish a land office and issue numerous grant for land within its limit a senator and a representative reside in it be elect to the congress of the republic and serve as such before the act of annexation take place in both the congress and convention of texas which give their assent to the term of annexation to the united states propose by our congress be representative reside west of the nueces who take part in the act of annexation itself this be the texas which by the act of our congress of the 29th of december 1845 be admit as one of the states of our union that the congress of the united states understand the state of texas which they admit into the union to extend beyond the nueces be apparent from the fact that on the 31st of december 1845 only two day after the act of admission they pass a law to establish a collection district in the state of texas by which they create a port of delivery at corpus christi situate west of the nueces and be the same point at which the texas custom house under the law of that republic have be locate and direct that a surveyor to collect the revenue should be appoint for that port by the president by and with the advice and consent of the senate a surveyor be accordingly nominate and confirm by the senate and have be ever since in the performance of his duty all these act of the republic of texas and of our congress precede the order for the advance of our army to the east bank of the rio grande subsequently congress pass an act establish certain post route extend west of the nueces the country west of that river now constitute a part of one of the congressional district of texas and be represent in the house of representatives the senators from that state be choose by a legislature in which the country west of that river be represent in view of all these fact it be difficult to conceive upon what ground it can be maintain that in occupy the country west of the nueces with our army with a view solely to its security and defense we invade the territory of mexico but it would have be still more difficult to justify the executive whose duty it be to see that the law be faithfully execute if in the face of all these proceeding both of the congress of texas and of the united states he have assume the responsibility of yield up the territory west of the nueces to mexico or of refuse to protect and defend this territory and its inhabitant include corpus christi as well as the remainder of texas against the threaten mexican invasion
 but mexico herself have never place the war which she have wage upon the ground that our army occupy the intermediate territory between the nueces and the rio grande her refuted pretension that texas be not in fact an independent state but a rebellious province be obstinately persevered in and her avow purpose in commence a war with the united states be to reconquer texas and to restore mexican authority over the whole territory not to the nueces only but to the sabine in view of the proclaim menace of mexico to this effect i deem it my duty as a measure of precaution and defense to order our army to occupy a position on our frontier as a military post from which our troop could well resist and repel any attempt invasion which mexico might make our army have occupy a position at corpus christi west of the nueces as early as august 1845 without complaint from any quarter have the nueces be regard as the true western boundary of texas that boundary have be pass by our army many month before it advance to the eastern bank of the rio grande in my annual message of december last i inform congress that upon the invitation of both the congress and convention of texas i have deem it proper to order a strong squadron to the coast of mexico and to concentrate an efficient military force on the western frontier of texas to protect and defend the inhabitant against the menace invasion of mexico in that message i inform congress that the moment the term of annexation offer by the united states be accept by texas the latter become so far a part of our own country as to make it our duty to afford such protection and defense and that for that purpose our squadron have be order to the gulf and our army to take a position between the nueces and the del norte or rio grande and to repel any invasion of the texan territory which might be attempt by the mexican force
 it be deem proper to issue this order because soon after the president of texas in april 1845 have issue his proclamation convene the congress of that republic for the purpose of submit to that body the term of annexation propose by the united states the government of mexico make serious threat of invade the texan territory these threat become more impose as it become more apparent in the progress of the question that the people of texas would decide in favor of accept the term of annexation and finally they have assume such a formidable character as induce both the congress and convention of texas to request that a military force should be send by the united states into her territory for the purpose of protect and defend she against the threatened invasion it would have be a violation of good faith toward the people of texas to have refuse to afford the aid which they desire against a threatened invasion to which they have be expose by their free determination to annex themselves to our union in compliance with the overture make to they by the joint resolution of our congress accordingly a portion of the army be order to advance into texas corpus christi be the position select by general taylor he encamp at that place in august 1845 and the army remain in that position until the 11th of march 1846 when it move westward and on the 28th of that month reach the east bank of the rio grande opposite to matamoras this movement be make in pursuance of order from the war department issue on the 13th of january 1846 before these order be issue the dispatch of our minister in mexico transmit the decision of the council of government of mexico advise that he should not be receive and also the dispatch of our consul reside in the city of mexico the former bearing date on the 17th and the latter on the 18th of december 1845 copy of both of which accompany my message to congress of the 11th of may last be receive at the department of state these communication render it highly probable if not absolutely certain that our minister would not be receive by the government of general herrera it be also well know that but little hope could be entertain of a different result from general paredes in case the revolutionary movement which he be prosecute should prove successful as be highly probable the partisan of paredes as our minister in the dispatch refer to state breathe the fierce hostility against the united states denounce the propose negotiation as treason and openly call upon the troop and the people to put down the government of herrera by force the reconquest of texas and war with the united states be openly threaten these be the circumstance exist when it be deem proper to order the army under the command of general taylor to advance to the western frontier of texas and occupy a position on or near the rio grande
 the apprehension of a contemplated mexican invasion have be since fully justify by the event the determination of mexico to rush into hostility with the united states be afterwards manifest from the whole tenor of the note of the mexican minister of foreign affair to our minister bear date on the 12th of march 1846 parede have then revolutionize the government and his minister after refer to the resolution for the annexation of texas which have be adopt by our congress in march 1845 proceed to declare that--
 a fact such as this or to speak with great exactness so notable an act of usurpation create an imperious necessity that mexico for her own honor should repel it with proper firmness and dignity the supreme government have beforehand declare that it would look upon such an act as a casus belli and as a consequence of this declaration negotiation be by its very nature at an end and war be the only recourse of the mexican government
 it appear also that on the 4th of april follow general paredes through his minister of war issue order to the mexican general in command on the texan frontier to attack our army by every mean which war permit to this general paredes have be pledge to the army and people of mexico during the military revolution which have bring he into power on the 18th of april 1846 general paredes address a letter to the commander on that frontier in which he state to he at the present date i suppose you at the head of that valiant army either fight already or prepare for the operation of a campaign and supposing you already on the theater of operation and with all the force assemble it be indispensable that hostility be commence yourself take the initiative against the enemy
 the movement of our army to the rio grande be make by the command general under positive order to abstain from all aggressive act toward mexico or mexican citizen and to regard the relation between the two country as peaceful unless mexico should declare war or commit act of hostility indicative of a state of war and these order he faithfully execute whilst occupy his position on the east bank of the rio grande within the limit of texas then recently admit as one of the states of our union the command general of the mexican force who in pursuance of the order of his government have collect a large army on the opposite shore of the rio grande cross the river invade our territory and commence hostility by attack our force thus after all the injury which we have receive and bear from mexico and after she have insultingly reject a minister send to she on a mission of peace and whom she have solemnly agree to receive she consummate her long course of outrage against our country by commence an offensive war and shed the blood of our citizen on our own soil
 the united states never attempt to acquire texas by conquest on the contrary at an early period after the people of texas have achieve their independence they seek to be annex to the united states at a general election in september 1836 they decide with great unanimity in favor of annexation and in november follow the congress of the republic authorize the appointment of a minister to bear their request to this government this government however having remain neutral between texas and mexico during the war between they and consider it due to the honor of our country and our fair fame among the nation of the earth that we should not at this early period consent to annexation nor until it should be manifest to the whole world that the reconqu of texas by mexico be impossible refuse to accede to the overture make by texas on the 12th of april 1844 after more than seven year have elapse since texas have establish her independence a treaty be conclude for the annexation of that republic to the united states which be reject by the senate finally on the 1st of march 1845 congress pass a joint resolution for annex she to the united states upon certain preliminary condition to which her assent be require the solemnity which characterize the deliberation and conduct of the government and people of texas on the deeply interesting question present by these resolution be know to the world the congress the executive and the people of texas in a convention elect for that purpose accept with great unanimity the propose term of annexation and thus consummate on her part the great act of restore to our federal union a vast territory which have be cede to spain by the florida treaty more than a quarter of a century before
 after the joint resolution for the annexation of texas to the united states have be pass by our congress the mexican minister at washington address a note to the secretary of state bear date on the 6th of march 1845 protest against it as an act of aggression the most unjust which can be find record in the annal of modern history namely that of despoil a friendly nation like mexico of a considerable portion of her territory and protest against the resolution of annexation as be an act whereby the province of texas an integral portion of the mexican territory be agree and admit into the american union and he announce that as a consequence his mission to the united states have terminate and demand his passport which be grant it be upon the absurd pretext make by mexico herself indebted for her independence to a successful revolution that the republic of texas still continue to be notwithstanding all that have pass a province of mexico that this step be take by the mexican minister
 every honorable effort have be use by i to avoid the war which follow but all have prove vain all our attempt to preserve peace have be meet by insult and resistance on the part of mexico my effort to this end commence in the note of the secretary of state of the 10th of march 1845 in answer to that of the mexican minister whilst decline to reopen a discussion which have already be exhaust and prove again what be know to the whole world that texas have long since achieve her independence the secretary of state express the regret of this government that mexico should have take offense at the resolution of annexation pass by congress and give assurance that our most strenuous effort shall be devoted to the amicable adjustment of every cause of complaint between the two government and to the cultivation of the kind and most friendly relation between the sister republics that i have act in the spirit of this assurance will appear from the event which have since occur notwithstanding mexico have abruptly terminate all diplomatic intercourse with the united states and ought therefore to have be the first to ask for its resumption yet waive all ceremony i embrace the early favorable opportunity to ascertain from the mexican government whether they would receive an envoy from the united states intrust with full power to adjust all the question in dispute between the two government in september 1845 i believe the propitious moment for such an overture have arrive texas by the enthusiastic and almost unanimous will of her people have pronounce in favor of annexation mexico herself have agree to acknowledge the independence of texas subject to a condition it be true which she have no right to impose and no power to enforce the last linger hope of mexico if she still could have retain any that texas would ever again become one of her provinces must have be abandon
 the consul of the united states at the city of mexico be therefore instruct by the secretary of state on the 15th of september 1845 to make the inquiry of the mexican government the inquiry be make and on the 15th of october 1845 the minister of foreign affair of the mexican government in a note address to our consul give a favorable response request at the same time that our naval force might be withdraw from vera cruz while negotiation should be pende upon the receipt of this note our naval force be promptly withdraw from vera cruz a minister be immediately appoint and depart to mexico everything bear a promising aspect for a speedy and peaceful adjustment of all our difficulty at the date of my annual message to congress in december last no doubt be entertain but that he would be receive by the mexican government and the hope be cherish that all cause of misunderstanding between the two country would be speedily remove in the confident hope that such would be the result of his mission i inform congress that i forbear at that time to recommend such ulterior measure of redress for the wrong and injury we have so long bear as it would have be proper to make have no such negotiation be institute to my surprise and regret the mexican government though solemnly pledge to do so upon the arrival of our minister in mexico refuse to receive and accredit he when he reach vera cruz on the 30th of november 1845 he find that the aspect of affair have undergo an unhappy change the government of general herrera who be at that time president of the republic be totter to its fall general paredes a military leader have manifest his determination to overthrow the government of herrera by a military revolution and one of the principal mean which he employ to effect his purpose and render the government of herrera odious to the army and people of mexico be by loudly condemn its determination to receive a minister of peace from the united states allege that it be the intention of herrera by a treaty with the united states to dismember the territory of mexico by cede away the department of texas the government of herrera be believe to have be well disposed to a pacific adjustment of exist difficulty but probably alarmed for its own security and in order to ward off the danger of the revolution lead by paredes violate its solemn agreement and refuse to receive or accredit our minister and this although inform that he have be invest with full power to adjust all question in dispute between the two government among the frivolous pretext for this refusal the principal one be that our minister have not go upon a special mission confine to the question of texas alone leave all the outrage upon our flag and our citizen unredresse the mexican government well know that both our national honor and the protection due to our citizen imperatively require that the two question of boundary and indemnity should be treat of together as naturally and inseparably blend and they ought to have see that this course be well calculate to enable the united states to extend to they the most liberal justice on the 30th of december 1845 general herrera resign the presidency and yield up the government to general paredes without a struggle thus a revolution be accomplish solely by the army command by paredes and the supreme power in mexico pass into the hand of a military usurper who be know to be bitterly hostile to the united states
 although the prospect of a pacific adjustment with the new government be unpromise from the known hostility of its head to the united states yet determine that nothing should be leave undone on our part to restore friendly relation between the two country our minister be instruct to present his credential to the new government and ask to be accredit by it in the diplomatic character in which he have be commission these instruction he execute by his note of the 1st of march 1846 address to the mexican minister of foreign affair but his request be insultingly refuse by that minister in his answer of the 12th of the same month no alternative remain for our minister but to demand his passport and return to the united states
 thus be the extraordinary spectacle present to the civilized world of a government in violation of its own express agreement having twice reject a minister of peace invest with full power to adjust all the exist difference between the two country in a manner just and honorable to both i be not aware that modern history present a parallel case in which in time of peace one nation have refuse even to hear proposition from another for terminate exist difficulty between they scarcely a hope of adjust our difficulty even at a remote day or of preserve peace with mexico could be cherish while paredes remain at the head of the government he have acquire the supreme power by a military revolution and upon the most solemn pledge to wage war against the united states and to reconquer texas which he claim as a revolted province of mexico he have denounce as guilty of treason all those mexicans who consider texas as no long constitute a part of the territory of mexico and who be friendly to the cause of peace the duration of the war which he wage against the united states be indefinite because the end which he propose of the reconqu of texas be hopeless besides there be good reason to believe from all his conduct that it be his intention to convert the republic of mexico into a monarchy and to call a foreign european prince to the throne preparatory to this end he have during his short rule destroy the liberty of the press tolerate that portion of it only which openly advocate the establishment of a monarchy the well to secure the success of his ultimate design he have by an arbitrary decree convoke a congress not to be elect by the free voice of the people but to be choose in a manner to make they subservient to his will and to give he absolute control over their deliberation
 under all these circumstance it be believe that any revolution in mexico found upon opposition to the ambitious project of paredes would tend to promote the cause of peace as well as prevent any attempt european interference in the affair of the north american continent both object of deep interest to the united states any such foreign interference if attempt must have be resist by the united states my view upon that subject be fully communicate to congress in my last annual message in any event it be certain that no change whatever in the government of mexico which would deprive paredes of power could be for the bad so far as the united states be concern while it be highly probable that any change must be for the well this be the state of affair exist when congress on the 13th of may last recognize the existence of the war which have be commence by the government of paredes and it become an object of much importance with a view to a speedy settlement of our difficulty and the restoration of an honorable peace that paredes should not retain power in mexico
 before that time there be symptom of a revolution in mexico favor as it be understand to be by the more liberal party and especially by those who be oppose to foreign interference and to the monarchical form of government santa anna be then in exile in havana having be expel from power and banish from his country by a revolution which occur in december 1844 but it be know that he have still a considerable party in his favor in mexico it be also equally well know that no vigilance which could be exert by our squadron would in all probability have prevent he from effect a landing somewhere on the extensive gulf coast of mexico if he desire to return to his country he have openly profess an entire change of policy have express his regret that he have subvert the federal constitution of 1824 and avow that he be now in favor of its restoration he have publicly declare his hostility in strong term to the establishment of a monarchy and to european interference in the affair of his country information to this effect have be receive from source believe to be reliable at the date of the recognition of the existence of the war by congress and be afterwards fully confirm by the receipt of the dispatch of our consul in the city of mexico with the accompany document which be herewith transmit besides it be reasonable to suppose that he must see the ruinous consequence to mexico of a war with the united states and that it would be his interest to favor peace
 it be under these circumstance and upon these consideration that it be deem expedient not to obstruct his return to mexico should he attempt to do so our object be the restoration of peace and with that view no reason be perceive why we should take part with paredes and aid he by mean of our blockade in prevent the return of his rival to mexico on the contrary it be believe that the intestine division which ordinary sagacity could not but anticipate as the fruit of santa anna&#39;s return to mexico and his contest with paredes might strongly tend to produce a disposition with both party to restore and preserve peace with the united states paredes be a soldier by profession and a monarchist in principle he have but recently before be successful in a military revolution by which he have obtain power he be the sworn enemy of the united states with which he have involve his country in the exist war santa anna have be expel from power by the army be know to be in open hostility to paredes and publicly pledge against foreign intervention and the restoration of monarchy in mexico in view of these fact and circumstance it be that when order be issue to the commander of our naval force in the gulf on the 13th day of may last the same day on which the existence of the war be recognize by congress to place the coast of mexico under blockade he be direct not to obstruct the passage of santa anna to mexico should he attempt to return
 a revolution take place in mexico in the early part of august follow by which the power of paredes be overthrow and he have since be banish from the country and be now in exile shortly afterwards santa anna return it remain to be see whether his return may not yet prove to be favorable to a pacific adjustment of the exist difficulty it be manifestly his interest not to persevere in the prosecution of a war commence by parede to accomplish a purpose so absurd as the reconqu of texas to the sabine have paredes remain in power it be morally certain that any pacific adjustment would have be hopeless
 upon the commencement of hostility by mexico against the united states the indignant spirit of the nation be at once arouse congress promptly respond to the expectation of the country and by the act of the 13th of may last recognize the fact that war exist by the act of mexico between the united states and that republic and grant the mean necessary for its vigorous prosecution be involve in a war thus commence by mexico and for the justice of which on our part we may confidently appeal to the whole world i resolve to prosecute it with the utmost vigor accordingly the port of mexico on the gulf and on the pacific have be place under blockade and her territory invade at several important point the report from the departments of war and of the navy will inform you more in detail of the measure adopt in the emergency in which our country be place and of the gratifying result which have be accomplish
 the various column of the army have perform their duty under great disadvantage with the most distinguished skill and courage the victory of palo alto and resaca de la palma and of monterey win against greatly superior number and against most decide advantage in other respect on the part of the enemy be brilliant in their execution and entitle our brave officer and soldier to the grateful thank of their country the nation deplore the loss of the brave officer and man who have gallantly fall while vindicate and defend their country&#39; right and honor
 it be a subject of pride and satisfaction that our volunteer citizen soldier who so promptly respond to their country&#39; call with an experience of the discipline of a camp of only a few week have bear their part in the hard fought battle of monterey with a constancy and courage equal to that of veteran troop and worthy of the high admiration the privation of long marche through the enemy&#39;s country and through a wilderness have be bear without a murmur by rapid movement the province of new mexico with santa fe its capital have be capture without bloodshed the navy have cooperate with the army and render important service if not so brilliant it be because the enemy have no force to meet they on their own element and because of the defense which nature have interpose in the difficulty of the navigation on the mexican coast our squadron in the pacific with the cooperation of a gallant officer of the army and a small force hastily collect in that distant country have acquire bloodless possession of the californias and the american flag have be raise at every important point in that province
 i congratulate you on the success which have thus attend our military and naval operation in less than seven month after mexico commence hostility at a time select by herself we have take possession of many of her principal port drive back and pursue her invade army and acquire military possession of the mexican provinces of new mexico new leon coahuila tamaulipas and the californias a territory large in extent than that embrace in the original thirteen states of the union inhabit by a considerable population and much of it more than 1,000 mile from the point at which we have to collect our force and commence our movement by the blockade the import and export trade of the enemy have be cut off well may the american people be proud of the energy and gallantry of our regular and volunteer officer and soldier the event of these few month afford a gratifying proof that our country can under any emergency confidently rely for the maintenance of her honor and the defense of her right on an effective force ready at all time voluntarily to relinquish the comfort of home for the peril and privation of the camp and though such a force may be for the time expensive it be in the end economical as the ability to command it remove the necessity of employ a large stand army in time of peace and prove that our people love their institution and be ever ready to defend and protect they
 while the war be in a course of vigorous and successful prosecution be still anxious to arrest its evil and consider that after the brilliant victory of our arm on the 8th and 9th of may last the national honor could not be compromitte by it another overture be make to mexico by my direction on the 27th of july last to terminate hostility by a peace just and honorable to both country on the 31st of august follow the mexican government decline to accept this friendly overture but refer it to the decision of a mexican congress to be assemble in the early part of the present month i communicate to you herewith a copy of the letter of the secretary of state propose to reopen negotiation of the answer of the mexican government and of the reply thereto of the secretary of state
 the war will continue to be prosecute with vigor as the good mean of secure peace it be hope that the decision of the mexican congress to which our last overture have be refer may result in a speedy and honorable peace with our experience however of the unreasonable course of the mexican authority it be the part of wisdom not to relax in the energy of our military operation until the result be make known in this view it be deem important to hold military possession of all the province which have be take until a definitive treaty of peace shall have be conclude and ratify by the two country
 the war have not be wage with a view to conquest but having be commence by mexico it have be carry into the enemy&#39;s country and will be vigorously prosecute there with a view to obtain an honorable peace and thereby secure ample indemnity for the expense of the war as well as to our much injure citizen who hold large pecuniary demand against mexico
 by the law of nation a conquered country be subject to be govern by the conqueror during his military possession and until there be either a treaty of peace or he shall voluntarily withdraw from it the old civil government be necessarily supersede it be the right and duty of the conqueror to secure his conquest and to provide for the maintenance of civil order and the right of the inhabitant this right have be exercise and this duty perform by our military and naval commander by the establishment of temporary government in some of the conquered provinces of mexico assimilate they as far as practicable to the free institution of our own country in the provinces of new mexico and of the californias little if any further resistance be apprehend from the inhabitant to the temporary government which have thus from the necessity of the case and accord to the law of war be establish it may be proper to provide for the security of these important conquest by make an adequate appropriation for the purpose of erect fortification and defray the expense necessarily incident to the maintenance of our possession and authority over they
 near the close of your last session for reason communicate to congress i deem it important as a measure for secure a speedy peace with mexico that a sum of money should be appropriate and place in the power of the executive similar to that which have be make upon two former occasion during the administration of president jefferson
 on the 26th of february 1803 an appropriation of $ 2,000.000 be make and place at the disposal of the president its object be well know it be at that time in contemplation to acquire louisiana from france and it be intend to be apply as a part of the consideration which might be pay for that territory on the 13th of february 1806 the same sum be in like manner appropriate with a view to the purchase of the floridas from spain these appropriation be make to facilitate negotiation and as a means to enable the president to accomplish the important object in view though it do not become necessary for the president to use these appropriation yet a state of thing might have arise in which it would have be highly important for he to do so and the wisdom of make they can not be doubt it be believe that the measure recommend at your last session meet with the approbation of decide majority in both houses of congress indeed in different form a bill make an appropriation of $ 2,000,000 pass each house and it be much to be regret that it do not become a law the reason which induce i to recommend the measure at that time still exist and i again submit the subject for your consideration and suggest the importance of early action upon it should the appropriation be make and be not need it will remain in the treasury should it be deem proper to apply it in whole or in part it will be account for as other public expenditure
 immediately after congress have recognize the existence of the war with mexico my attention be direct to the danger that privateer might be fit out in the port of cuba and porto rico to prey upon the commerce of the united states and i invite the special attention of the spanish government to the fourteenth article of our treaty with that power of the 27th of october 1795 under which the citizen and subject of either nation who shall take commission or letter of marque to act as privateer against the other shall be punish as pirate
 it afford i pleasure to inform you that i have receive assurance from the spanish government that this article of the treaty shall be faithfully observe on its part order for this purpose be immediately transmit from that government to the authority of cuba and porto rico to exert their utmost vigilance in prevent any attempt to fit out privateer in those island against the united states from the good faith of spain i be fully satisfied that this treaty will be execute in its spirit as well as its letter whilst the united states will on their part faithfully perform all the obligation which it impose on they
 information have be recently receive at the department of state that the mexican government have send to havana blank commission to privateer and blank certificate of naturalization sign by general salas the present head of the mexican government there be also reason to apprehend that similar document have be transmit to other part of the world copy of these paper in translation be herewith transmit
 as the preliminary require by the practice of civilized nation for commission privateer and regulate their conduct appear not to have be observe and as these commission be in blank to be fill up with the name of citizen and subject of all nation who may be willing to purchase they the whole proceeding can only be construe as an invitation to all the freebooter upon earth who be willing to pay for the privilege to cruise against american commerce it will be for our court of justice to decide whether under such circumstance these mexican letter of marque and reprisal shall protect those who accept they and commit robbery upon the high sea under their authority from the pain and penalty of piracy
 if the certificate of naturalization thus grant be intend by mexico to shield spanish subject from the guilt and punishment of pirate under our treaty with spain they will certainly prove unavaile such a subterfuge would be but a weak device to defeat the provision of a solemn treaty
 i recommend that congress should immediately provide by law for the trial and punishment as pirate of spanish subject who escape the vigilance of their government shall be find guilty of privateere against the united states i do not apprehend serious danger from these privateer our navy will be constantly on the alert to protect our commerce besides in case prize should be make of american vessel the utmost vigilance will be exert by our blockade squadron to prevent the captor from take they into mexican port and it be not apprehend that any nation will violate its neutrality by suffer such prize to be condemn and sell within its jurisdiction
 i recommend that congress should immediately provide by law for grant letter of marque and reprisal against vessel under the mexican flag it be true that there be but few if any commercial vessel of mexico upon the high sea and it be therefore not probable that many american privateer would be fit out in case a law should pass authorize this mode of warfare it be notwithstanding certain that such privateer may render good service to the commercial interest of the country by recapture our merchant ship should any be take by armed vessel under the mexican flag as well as by capture these vessel themselves every mean within our power should be render available for the protection of our commerce
 the annual report of the secretary of the treasury will exhibit a detailed statement of the condition of the finance the import for the fiscal year end on the 30th of june last be of the value of $ 121,691,797 of which the amount export be $ 11,346,623 leave the amount retain in the country for domestic consumption $ 110,345,174 the value of the export for the same period be $ 113,488,516 of which $ 102,141,893 consist of domestic production and $ 11,346,623 of foreign article
 the receipt into the treasury for the same year be $ 29,499,247.06 of which there be derive from custom $ 26,712,667.87 from the sale of public land $ 2,694,452.48 and from incidental and miscellaneous source $ 92,126.71 the expenditure for the same period be $ 28,031,114.20 and the balance in the treasury on the 1st day of july last be $ 9,126,439 08
 the amount of the public debt include treasury note on the 1st of the present month be $ 24,256,494.60 of which the sum of $ 17,788,799.62 be outstanding on the 4th of march 1845 leave the amount incur since that time $ 6,467,694.98
 in order to prosecute the war with mexico with vigor and energy as the good mean of bring it to a speedy and honorable termination a further loan will be necessary to meet the expenditure for the present and the next fiscal year if the war should be continue until the 30th of june 1848 be the end of the next fiscal year it be estimate that an additional loan of $ 23,000,000 will be require this estimate be make upon the assumption that it will be necessary to retain constantly in the treasury $ 4,000,000 to guard against contingency if such surplus be not require to be retain then a loan of $ 19,000,000 would be sufficient if however congress should at the present session impose a revenue duty on the principal article now embrace in the free list it be estimate that an additional annual revenue of about two million and a half amount it be estimate on the 30th of june 1848 to $ 4,000,000 would be derive from that source and the loan require would be reduce by that amount it be estimate also that should congress graduate and reduce the price of such of the public land as have be long in the market the additional revenue derive from that source would be annually for several year to come between half a million and a million dollar and the loan require may be reduce by that amount also should these measure be adopt the loan require would not probably exceed $ 18,000,000 or $ 19,000,000 leave in the treasury a constant surplus of $ 4,000,000 the loan propose it be estimate will be sufficient to cover the necessary expenditure both for the war and for all other purpose up to the 30th of june 1848 and an amount of this loan not exceed one half may be require during the present fiscal year and the great part of the remainder during the first half of the fiscal year succeed
 in order that timely notice may be give and proper measure take to effect the loan or such portion of it as may be require it be important that the authority of congress to make it be give at an early period of your present session it be suggest that the loan should be contract for a period of twenty year with authority to purchase the stock and pay it off at an early period at its market value out of any surplus which may at any time be in the treasury applicable to that purpose after the establishment of peace with mexico it be suppose that a considerable surplus will exist and that the debt may be extinguish in a much short period than that for which it may be contract the period of twenty year as that for which the propose loan may be contract in preference to a short period be suggest because all experience both at home and abroad have show that loan be effect upon much well term upon long time than when they be reimbursable at short date
 necessary as this measure be to sustain the honor and the interest of the country engage in a foreign war it be not doubted but that congress will promptly authorize it
 the balance in the treasury on the 1st july last exceed $ 9,000,000 notwithstanding considerable expenditure have be make for the war during the month of may and june precede but for the war the whole public debt could and would have be extinguish within a short period and it be a part of my settle policy to do so and thus relieve the people from its burden and place the government in a position which would enable it to reduce the public expenditure to that economical standard which be most consistent with the general welfare and the pure and wholesome progress of our institution
 among our just cause of complaint against mexico arise out of her refusal to treat for peace as well before as since the war so unjustly commence on her part be the extraordinary expenditure in which we have be involve justice to our own people will make it proper that mexico should be hold responsible for these expenditure
 economy in the public expenditure be at all time a high duty which all public functionary of the government owe to the people this duty become the more imperative in a period of war when large and extraordinary expenditure become unavoidable during the existence of the war with mexico all our resource should be husband and no appropriation make except such as be absolutely necessary for its vigorous prosecution and the due administration of the government object of appropriation which in peace may be deem useful or proper but which be not indispensable for the public service may when the country be engage in a foreign war be well postpone to a future period by the observance of this policy at your present session large amount may be save to the treasury and be apply to object of press and urgent necessity and thus the creation of a corresponding amount of public debt may be avoid
 it be not mean to recommend that the ordinary and necessary appropriation for the support of government should be withhold but it be well know that at every session of congress appropriation be propose for numerous object which may or may not be make without materially affect the public interest and these it be recommend should not be grant
 the act pass at your last session reduce the duty on import not having go into operation until the 1st of the present month there have not be time for its practical effect upon the revenue and the business of the country to be develop it be not doubted however that the just policy which it adopt will add largely to our foreign trade and promote the general prosperity although it can not be certainly foresee what amount of revenue it will yield it be estimate that it will exceed that produce by the act of 1842 which it supersede the lead principle establish by it be to levy the taxis with a view to raise revenue and to impose they upon the article import accord to their actual value
 the act of 1842 by the excessive rate of duty which it impose on many article either totally exclude they from importation or greatly reduce the amount import and thus diminish instead of produce revenue by it the taxis be impose not for the legitimate purpose of raise revenue but to afford advantage to favor class at the expense of a large majority of their fellow citizen those employ in agriculture mechanical pursuit commerce and navigation be compel to contribute from their substance to swell the profit and overgrown wealth of the comparatively few who have invest their capital in manufacture the taxis be not levy in proportion to the value of the article upon which they be impose but widely depart from this just rule the light taxis be in many case levy upon article of luxury and high price and the heavy taxis on those of necessity and low price consume by the great mass of the people it be a system the inevitable effect of which be to relieve favor class and the wealthy few from contribute their just proportion for the support of government and to lay the burden on the labor of the many engage in other pursuit than manufacture
 a system so unequal and unjust have be supersede by the exist law which impose duty not for the benefit or injury of class or pursuit but distribute and as far as practicable equalize the public burden among all class and occupation the favor class who under the unequal and unjust system which have be repeal have heretofore realize large profit and many of they amass large fortune at the expense of the many who have be make tributary to they will have no reason to complain if they shall be require to bear their just proportion of the taxis necessary for the support of government so far from it it will be perceive by an examination of the exist law that discrimination in the rate of duty impose within the revenue principle have be retain in their favor the incidental aid against foreign competition which they still enjoy give they an advantage which no other pursuit possess but of this none other will complain because the duty levy be necessary for revenue these revenue duty include freight and charge which the importer must pay before he can come in competition with the home manufacturer in our market amount on nearly all our lead branch of manufacture to more than one third of the value of the import article and in some case to almost one half its value with such advantage it be not doubt that our domestic manufacturer will continue to prosper realize in well conduct establishment even great profit than can be derive from any other regular business indeed so far from require the protection of even incidental revenue duty our manufacturer in several lead branch be extend their business give evidence of great ingenuity and skill and of their ability to compete with increase prospect of success for the open market of the world domestic manufacture to the value of several million of dollar which can not find a market at home be annually export to foreign country with such rate of duty as those establish by the exist law the system will probably be permanent and capitalist who be make or shall hereafter make their investment in manufacture will know upon what to rely the country will be satisfied with these rate because the advantage which the manufacturer still enjoy result necessarily from the collection of revenue for the support of government high protective duty from their unjust operation upon the masse of the people can not fail to give rise to extensive dissatisfaction and complaint and to constant effort to change or repeal they render all investment in manufacture uncertain and precarious low and more permanent rate of duty at the same time that they will yield to the manufacturer fair and remunerate profit will secure he against the danger of frequent change in the system which can not fail to ruinously affect his interest
 simultaneously with the relaxation of the restrictive policy by the united states great britain from whose example we derive the system have relax her she have modify her corn law and reduce many other duty to moderate revenue rate after age of experience the statesman of that country have be constrain by a stern necessity and by a public opinion have its deep foundation in the suffering and want of impoverished million to abandon a system the effect of which be to build up immense fortune in the hand of the few and to reduce the labor million to pauperism and misery nearly in the same ratio that labor be depressed capital be increase and concentrate by the british protective policy
 the evil of the system in great britain be at length render intolerable and it have be abandon but not without a severe struggle on the part of the protect and favor class to retain the unjust advantage which they have so long enjoy it be to be expect that a similar struggle would be make by the same class in the united states whenever an attempt be make to modify or abolish the same unjust system here the protective policy have be in operation in the united states for a much short period and its pernicious effect be not therefore so clearly perceive and feel enough however be know of these effect to induce its repeal
 it would be strange if in the face of the example of great britain our principal foreign customer and of the evil of a system render manifest in that country by long and painful experience and in the face of the immense advantage which under a more liberal commercial policy we be already derive and must continue to derive by supply her starve population with food the united states should restore a policy which she have be compel to abandon and thus diminish her ability to purchase from we the food and other article which she so much need and we so much desire to sell by the simultaneous abandonment of the protective policy by great britain and the united states new and important market have already be open for our agricultural and other product commerce and navigation have receive a new impulse labor and trade have be release from the artificial trammel which have so long fetter they and to a great extent reciprocity in the exchange of commodity have be introduce at the same time by both country and greatly for the benefit of both great britain have be force by the pressure of circumstance at home to abandon a policy which have be uphold for age and to open her market for our immense surplus of breadstuff and it be confidently believe that other power of europe will ultimately see the wisdom if they be not compel by the pauperism and suffering of their crowded population to pursue a similar policy
 our farmer be more deeply interested in maintain the just and liberal policy of the exist law than any other class of our citizen they constitute a large majority of our population and it be well know that when they prosper all other pursuit prosper also they have heretofore not only receive none of the bounty or favor of government but by the unequal operation of the protective policy have be make by the burden of taxation which it impose to contribute to the bounty which have enrich other
 when a foreign as well as a home market be open to they they must receive as they be now receive increase price for their product they will find a readier sale and at well price for their wheat flour rice indian corn beef pork lard butter cheese and other article which they produce the home market alone be inadequate to enable they to dispose of the immense surplus of food and other article which they be capable of produce even at the most reduced price for the manifest reason that they can not be consume in the country the united states can from their immense surplus supply not only the home demand but the deficiency of food require by the whole world
 that the reduced production of some of the chief article of food in great britain and other part of europe may have contribute to increase the demand for our breadstuff and provision be not doubt but that the great and efficient cause of this increase demand and of increase price consist in the removal of artificial restriction heretofore impose be deem to be equally certain that our export of food already increase and increase beyond former example under the more liberal policy which have be adopt will be still vastly enlarge unless they be check or prevent by a restoration of the protective policy can not be doubt that our commercial and navigating interest will be enlarge in a corresponding ratio with the increase of our trade be equally certain while our manufacture interest will still be the favor interest of the country and receive the incidental protection afford they by revenue duty and more than this they can not justly demand
 in my annual message of december last a tariff of revenue duty base upon the principle of the exist law be recommend and i have see no reason to change the opinion then express in view of the probable beneficial effect of that law i recommend that the policy establish by it be maintain it have but just commence to operate and to abandon or modify it without give it a fair trial would be inexpedient and unwise should defect in any of its detail be ascertain by actual experience to exist these may be hereafter correct but until such defect shall become manifest the act should be fairly test
 it be submit for your consideration whether it may not be proper as a war measure to impose revenue duty on some of the article now embrace in the free list should it be deem proper to impose such duty with a view to raise revenue to meet the expense of the war with mexico or to avoid to that extent the creation of a public debt they may be repeal when the emergency which give rise to they shall cease to exist and constitute no part of the permanent policy of the country
 the act of the 6th of august last to provide for the well organization of the treasury and for the collection safe keeping transfer and disbursement of the public revenue have be carry into execution as rapidly as the delay necessarily arise out of the appointment of new officer take and approve their bond and prepare and secure proper place for the safe keeping of the public money would permit it be not propose to depart in any respect from the principle or policy on which this great measure be rounded there be however defect in the detail of the measure develop by its practical operation which be fully set forth in the report of the secretary of the treasury to which the attention of congress be invite these defect would impair to some extent the successful operation of the law at all time but be especially embarrassing when the country be engage in a war when the expenditure be greatly increase when loan be to be effect and the disbursement be to be make at point many hundred mile distant in some case from any depository and a large portion of they in a foreign country the modification suggest in the report of the secretary of the treasury be recommend to your favorable consideration
 in connection with this subject i invite your attention to the importance of establish a branch of the mint of the united states at new york two third of the revenue derive from custom be collect at that point the demand for specie to pay the duty will be large and a branch mint where foreign coin and bullion could be immediately convert into american coin would greatly facilitate the transaction of the public business enlarge the circulation of gold and silver and be at the same time a safe depository of the public money
 the importance of graduate and reduce the price of such of the public land as have be long offer in the market at the minimum rate authorize by exist law and remain unsold induce i again to recommend the subject to your favorable consideration many million of acre of these land have be offer in the market for more than thirty year and large quantity for more than ten or twenty year and be of an inferior quality they must remain unsalable for an indefinite period unless the price at which they may be purchase shall be reduce to place a price upon they above their real value be not only to prevent their sale and thereby deprive the treasury of any income from that source but be unjust to the states in which they lie because it retard their growth and increase of population and because they have no power to levy a tax upon they as upon other land within their limit hold by other proprietor than the united states for the support of their local government
 the beneficial effect of the graduation principle have be realize by some of the states own the land within their limit in which it have be adopt they have be demonstrate also by the united states act as the trustee of the chickasaw tribe of indians in the sale of their land lie within the states of mississippi and alabama the chickasaw land which would not command in the market the minimum price establish by the law of the united states for the sale of their land be in pursuance of the treaty of 1834 with that tribe subsequently offer for sale at graduate and reduce rate for limited period the result be that large quantity of these land be purchase which would otherwise have remain unsold the land be dispose of at their real value and many person of limited mean be enable to purchase small tract upon which they have settle with their family that similar result would be produce by the adoption of the graduation policy by the united states in all the states in which they be the owner of large body of land which have be long in the market can not be doubt it can not be a sound policy to withhold large quantity of the public land from the use and occupation of our citizen by fix upon they price which experience have show they will not command on the contrary it be a wise policy to afford facility to our citizen to become the owner at low and moderate rate of freehold of their own instead of be the tenant and dependent of other if it be apprehend that these land if reduce in price would be secure in large quantity by speculator or capitalist the sale may be restrict in limited quantity to actual settler or person purchase for purpose of cultivation

to the senate and house of representatives of the united states
 in order to prosecute the war against mexico with vigor and success it be necessary that authority should be promptly give by congress to increase the regular army and to remedy exist defect in its organization with this view your favorable attention be invite to the annual report of the secretary of war which accompany my message of the 8th instant in which he recommend that ten additional regiment of regular troop shall be raise to serve during the war
 of the additional regiment of volunteer which have be call for from several of the states some have be promptly raise but this have not be the case in regard to all the exist law require that they should be organize by the independent action of the state government have in some instance occasion considerable delay and it be yet uncertain when the troop require can be ready for service in the field
 it be our settle policy to maintain in time of peace as small a regular army as the exigency of the public service will permit in a state of war notwithstanding the great advantage with which our volunteer citizen soldier can be bring into the field this small regular army must be increase in its number in order to render the whole force more efficient
 additional officer as well as man then become indispensable under the circumstance of our service a peculiar propriety exist for increase the officer especially in the high grade the number of such officer who from age and other cause be render incapable of active service in the field have seriously impair the efficiency of the army
 from the report of the secretary of war it appear that about two third of the whole number of regimental field officer be either permanently disabled or be necessarily detach from their command on other duty the long enjoyment of peace have prevent we from experience much embarrassment from this cause but now in a state of war conduct in a foreign country it have produce serious injury to the public service
 an efficient organization of the army compose of regular and volunteer whilst prosecute the war in mexico it be believe would require the appointment of a general officer to take the command of all our military force in the field upon the conclusion of the war the service of such an officer would no long be necessary and should be dispense with upon the reduction of the army to a peace establishment
 i recommend that provision be make by law for the appointment of such a general officer to serve during the war
 it be respectfully recommend that early action should be have by congress upon the suggestion submit for their consideration as necessary to insure active and efficient service in prosecute the war before the present favorable season for military operation in the enemy&#39;s country shall have pass away

to the senate and house of representatives of the united states
 congress by the act of the 13th of may last declare that by the act of the republic of mexico a state of war exist between that government and the united states and for the purpose of enable the government of the united states to prosecute say war to a speedy and successful termination authority be vest in the president to employ the naval and military force of the united states
 it have be my unalterable purpose since the commencement of hostility by mexico and the declaration of the existence of war by congress to prosecute the war in which the country be unavoidably involve with the utmost energy with a view to its speedy and successful termination by an honorable peace
 accordingly all the operation of our naval and military force have be direct with this view while the sword have be hold in one hand and our military movement press forward into the enemy&#39;s country and its coast invest by our navy the tender of an honorable peace have be constantly present to mexico in the other
 hitherto the overture of peace which have be make by this government have not be accept by mexico with a view to avoid a protract war which hesitancy and delay on our part would be so well calculate to produce i inform you in my annual message of the 8th december last that the war would continue to be prosecute with vigor as the good mean of secure peace and recommend to your early and favorable consideration the measure propose by the secretary of war in his report accompany that message
 in my message of the 4th january last these and other measure deem to be essential to they speedy and successful termination of the war and the attainment of a just and honorable peace be recommend to your early and favorable consideration
 the bad state of thing which could exist in a war with such a power as mexico would be a course of indecision and inactivity on our part be charge by the constitution and the law with the conduct of the war i have avail myself of all the mean at my command to prosecute it with energy and vigor
 the act to raise for a limited time an additional military force and for other purpose and which authorize the raising of ten additional regiment to the regular army to serve during the war and to be disband at its termination which be present to i on the 11th instant and approve on that day will constitute an important part of our military force these regiment will be raise and move to the seat of war with the least practicable delay
 it will be perceive that this act make no provision for the organization into brigade and division of the increase force which it authorize nor for the appointment of general officer to command it it will be proper that authority be give by law to make such organization and to appoint by and with the advice and consent of the senate such number of major general and brigadier general as the efficiency of the service may demand the number of officer of these grade now in service be not more than be require for their respective command but further legislative action during your present session will in my judgment be require and to which it be my duty respectfully to invite your attention
 should the war contrary to my earnest desire be protract to the close of the term of service of the volunteer now in mexico who engage for twelve month an additional volunteer force will probably become necessary to supply their place many of the volunteer now serve in mexico it be not doubt will cheerfully engage at the conclusion of their present term to serve during the war they would constitute a more efficient force than could be speedily obtain by accept the service of any new corp who might offer their service they would have the advantage of the experience and discipline of a year&#39;s service and will have become accustomed to the climate and be in less danger than new levy of suffer from the disease of the country i recommend therefore that authority be give to accept the service of such of the volunteer now in mexico as the state of the public service may require and who may at the termination of their present term voluntarily engage to serve during the war with mexico and that provision be make for commission the officer should this measure receive the favorable consideration of congress it be recommend that a bounty be grant to they upon their voluntarily extend their term of service this would not only be due to these gallant man but it would be economy to the government because if discharge at the end of the twelve month the government would be bind to incur a heavy expense in bring they back to their home and in send to the seat of war new corp of fresh troop to supply their place
 by the act of the 13th of may last the president be authorize to accept the service of volunteer in company battalion squadron and regiment but no provision be make for fill up vacancy which might occur by death or discharge from the service on account of sickness or other casualty in consequence of this omission many of the corps now in service have be much reduce in number nor be any provision make for fill vacancy of regimental or company officer who might die or resign information have be receive at the war department of the resignation of more than 100 of these officer they be appoint by the state authority and no information have be receive except in a few instance that their place have be fill and the efficiency of the service have be impair from this cause to remedy these defect i recommend that authority be give to accept the service of individual volunteer to fill up the place of such as may die or become unfit for the service and be discharge and that provision be also make for fill the place of regimental and company officer who may die or resign by such provision the volunteer corp may be constantly keep full or may approximate the maximum number authorize and call into service in the first instance
 while it be deem to be our true policy to prosecute the war in the manner indicate and thus make the enemy feel its pressure and its evil i shall be at all time ready with the authority confer on i by the constitution and with all the mean which may be place at my command by congress to conclude a just and honorable peace
 of equal importance with an energetic and vigorous prosecution of the war be the mean require to defray its expense and to uphold and maintain the public credit
 in my annual message of the 8th december last i submit for the consideration of congress the propriety of impose as a war measure revenue duty on some of the article now embrace in the free list the principal article now exempt from duty from which any considerable revenue could be derive be tea and coffee a moderate revenue duty on these article it be estimate would produce annually an amount exceed $ 2,500,000 though in a period of peace when ample mean could be derive from duty on other article for the support of the government it may have be deem proper not to resort to a duty on these article yet when the country be engage in a foreign war and all our resource be demand to meet the unavoidable increase expenditure in maintain our army in the field no sound reason be perceive why we should not avail ourselves of the revenue which may be derive from this source the objection which have heretofore exist to the imposition of these duty be applicable to a state of peace when they be not need we be now however engage in a foreign war we need money to prosecute it and to maintain the public honor and credit it can not be doubt that the patriotic people of the united states would cheerfully and without complaint submit to the payment of this additional duty or any other that may be necessary to maintain the honor of the country provide for the unavoidable expense of the government and to uphold the public credit it be recommend that any duty which may be impose on these article be limit in their duration to the period of the war
 an additional annual revenue it be estimate of between half a million and a million of dollar would be derive from the graduation and reduction of the price of such of the public land as have be long offer in the market at the minimum price establish by the exist law and have remain unsold and in addition to other reason commend the measure to favorable consideration it be recommend as a financial measure the duty suggest on tea and coffee and the graduation and reduction of the price of the public land would secure an additional annual revenue to the treasury of not less than $ 3,000,000 and would thereby prevent the necessity of incur a public debt annually to that amount the interest on which must be pay semiannually and ultimately the debt itself by a tax on the people
 it be a sound policy and one which have long be approve by the government and people of the united states never to resort to loan unless in case of great public emergency and then only for the small amount which the public necessity will permit
 the increase revenue which the measure now recommend would produce would moreover enable the government to negotiate a loan for any additional sum which may be find to be need with more facility and at cheap rate than can be do without they
 under the injunction of the constitution which make it my duty from time to time to give to congress information of the state of the union and to recommend to their consideration such measure as shall be judge necessary and expedient i respectfully and earnestly invite the action of congress on the measure herein present for their consideration the public good as well as a sense of my responsibility to our common constituent in my judgment imperiously demand that i should present they for your enlightened consideration and invoke favorable action upon they before the close of your present session


fellow citizen of the senate and of the house of representatives
 the annual meeting of congress be always an interesting event the representative of the states and of the people come fresh from their constituent to take counsel together for the common good
 after an existence of near three fourth of a century as a free and independent republic the problem no long remain to be solve whether man be capable of self government the success of our admirable system be a conclusive refutation of the theory of those in other country who maintain that a favor few be bear to rule and that the mass of mankind must be govern by force subject to no arbitrary or hereditary authority the people be the only sovereign recognize by our constitution
 numerous emigrant of every lineage and language attract by the civil and religious freedom we enjoy and by our happy condition annually crowd to our shore and transfer their heart not less than their allegiance to the country whose dominion belong alone to the people no country have be so much favor or should acknowledge with deep reverence the manifestation of the divine protection an all wise creator direct and guard we in our infant struggle for freedom and have constantly watch over our surprising progress until we have become one of the great nation of the earth
 it be in a country thus favor and under a government in which the executive and legislative branch hold their authority for limited period alike from the people and where all be responsible to their respective constituency that it be again my duty to communicate with congress upon the state of the union and the present condition of public affair
 during the past year the most gratifying proof be present that our country have be bless with a widespread and universal prosperity there have be no period since the government be found when all the industrial pursuit of our people have be more successful or when labor in all branch of business have receive a fair or well reward from our abundance we have be enable to perform the pleasing duty of furnish food for the starve million of less favor country
 in the enjoyment of the bounty of providence at home such as have rarely fall to the lot of any people it be cause of congratulation that our intercourse with all the power of the earth except mexico continue to be of an amicable character
 it have ever be our cherished policy to cultivate peace and good will with all nation and this policy have be steadily pursue by i no change have take place in our relation with mexico since the adjournment of the last congress the war in which the united states be force to engage with the government of that country still continue
 i deem it unnecessary after the full exposition of they contain in my message of the 11th of may 1846 and in my annual message at the commencement of the session of congress in december last to reiterate the serious cause of complaint which we have against mexico before she commence hostility
 it be sufficient on the present occasion to say that the wanton violation of the right of person and property of our citizen commit by mexico her repeat act of bad faith through a long series of year and her disregard of solemn treaty stipulate for indemnity to our injured citizen not only constitute ample cause of war on our part but be of such an aggravated character as would have justify we before the whole world in resort to this extreme remedy with an anxious desire to avoid a rupture between the two country we forbear for year to assert our clear right by force and continue to seek redress for the wrong we have suffer by amicable negotiation in the hope that mexico might yield to pacific counsel and the demand of justice in this hope we be disappoint our minister of peace send to mexico be insultingly reject the mexican government refuse even to hear the term of adjustment which he be authorize to propose and finally under wholly unjustifiable pretext involve the two country in war by invade the territory of the state of texas strike the first blow and shed the blood of our citizen on our own soil
 though the united states be the aggrieved nation mexico commence the war and we be compel in self defense to repel the invader and to vindicate the national honor and interest by prosecute it with vigor until we could obtain a just and honorable peace on learn that hostility have be commence by mexico i promptly communicate that fact accompany with a succinct statement of our other cause of complaint against mexico to congress and that body by the act of the 13th of may 1846 declare that by the act of the republic of mexico a state of war exist between that government and the united states this act declare the war to exist by the act of the republic of mexico and make provision for its prosecution to a speedy and successful termination be pass with great unanimity by congress there be but two negative vote in the senate and but fourteen in the house of representatives
 the existence of the war having thus be declare by congress it become my duty under the constitution and the law to conduct and prosecute it this duty have be perform and though at every stage of its progress i have manifest a willingness to terminate it by a just peace mexico have refuse to accede to any term which could be accept by the united states consistently with the national honor and interest
 the rapid and brilliant success of our arm and the vast extent of the enemy&#39;s territory which have be overrun and conquer before the close of the last session of congress be fully know to that body since that time the war have be prosecute with increase energy and i be gratified to state with a success which command universal admiration history present no parallel of so many glorious victory achieve by any nation within so short a period our army regular and volunteer have cover themselves with imperishable honor whenever and wherever our force have encounter the enemy though he be in vastly superior number and often intrench in fortified position of his own selection and of great strength he have be defeat too much praise can not be bestow upon our officer and man regular and volunteer for their gallantry discipline indomitable courage and perseverance all seek the post of danger and vie with each other in deed of noble daring
 while every patriot&#39;s heart must exult and a just national pride animate every bosom in behold the high proof of courage consummate military skill steady discipline and humanity to the vanquished enemy exhibit by our gallant army the nation be call to mourn over the loss of many brave officer and soldier who have fall in defense of their country&#39; honor and interest the brave dead meet their melancholy fate in a foreign land nobly discharge their duty and with their country&#39; flag wave triumphantly in the face of the foe their patriotic deed be justly appreciate and will long be remember by their grateful countryman the parental care of the government they love and serve should be extend to their survive family
 shortly after the adjournment of the last session of congress the gratify intelligence be receive of the signal victory of buena vista and of the fall of the city of vera cruz and with it the strong castle of san juan de ulloa by which it be defend believe that after these and other success so honorable to our arm and so disastrous to mexico the period be propitious to afford she another opportunity if she think proper to embrace it to enter into negotiation for peace a commissioner be appoint to proceed to the headquarters of our army with full power to enter upon negotiation and to conclude a just and honorable treaty of peace he be not direct to make any new overture of peace but be the bearer of a dispatch from the secretary of state of the united states to the minister of foreign affair of mexico in reply to one receive from the latter of the 22d of february 1847 in which the mexican government be inform of his appointment and of his presence at the headquarters of our army and that he be invest with full power to conclude a definitive treaty of peace whenever the mexican government might signify a desire to do so while i be unwilling to subject the united states to another indignant refusal i be yet resolve that the evil of the war should not be protract a day long than might be render absolutely necessary by the mexican government
 care be take to give no instruction to the commissioner which could in any way interfere with our military operation or relax our energy in the prosecution of the war he possess no authority in any manner to control these operation he be authorize to exhibit his instruction to the general in command of the army and in the event of a treaty be conclude and ratify on the part of mexico he be direct to give he notice of that fact on the happening of such contingency and on receive notice thereof the general in command be instruct by the secretary of war to suspend far active military operation until further order these instruction be give with a view to intermit hostility until the treaty thus ratify by mexico could be transmit to washington and receive the action of the government of the united states the commissioner be also direct on reach the army to deliver to the general in command the dispatch which he bear from the secretary of state to the minister of foreign affair of mexico and on receive it the general be instruct by the secretary of war to cause it to be transmit to the commander of the mexican force with a quest that it might be communicate to his government the commissioner do not reach the headquarters of the army until after another brilliant victory have crown our arm at cerro gordo the dispatch which he bear from the secretary of war to the general in command of the army be receive by that officer then at jalapa on the 7th of may 1847 together with the dispatch from the secretary of state to the minister of foreign affair of mexico having be transmit to he from vera cruz the commissioner arrive at the headquarters of the army a few day afterwards his presence with the army and his diplomatic character be make known to the mexican government from puebla on the 12th of june 1847 by the transmission of the dispatch from the secretary of state to the minister of foreign affair of mexico
 many week elapse after its receipt and no overture be make nor be any desire express by the mexican government to enter into negotiation for peace
 our army pursue its march upon the capital and as it approach it be meet by formidable resistance our force first encounter the enemy and achieve signal victory in the severely contest battle of contreras and churubusco it be not until after these action have result in decisive victory and the capital of the enemy be within our power that the mexican government manifest any disposition to enter into negotiation for peace and even then as event have prove there be too much reason to believe they be insincere and that in agree to go through the form of negotiation the object be to gain time to strengthen the defense of their capital and to prepare for fresh resistance
 the general in command of the army deem it expedient to suspend hostility temporarily by enter into an armistice with a view to the opening of negotiation commissioner be appoint on the part of mexico to meet the commissioner on the part of the united states the result of the conference which take place between these functionary of the two government be a failure to conclude a treaty of peace the commissioner of the united states take with he the project of a treaty already prepare by the term of which the indemnity require by the united states be a cession of territory
 it be well know that the only indemnity which it be in the power of mexico to make in satisfaction of the just and long defer claim of our citizen against she and the only mean by which she can reimburse the united states for the expense of the war be a cession to the united states of a portion of her territory mexico have no money to pay and no other mean of make the require indemnity if we refuse this we can obtain nothing else to reject indemnity by refuse to accept a cession of territory would be to abandon all our just demand and to wage the war bear all its expense without a purpose or definite object
 a state of war abrogate treaty previously exist between the belligerent and a treaty of peace put an end to all claim for indemnity for tortious act commit under the authority of one government against the citizen or subject of another unless they be provide for in its stipulation a treaty of peace which would terminate the exist war without provide for indemnity would enable mexico the acknowledge debtor and herself the aggressor in the war to relieve herself from her just liability by such a treaty our citizen who hold just demand against she would have no remedy either against mexico or their own government our duty to these citizen must forever prevent such a peace and no treaty which do not provide ample mean of discharge these demand can receive my sanction
 a treaty of peace should settle all exist difference between the two country if an adequate cession of territory should be make by such a treaty the united states should release mexico from all her liability and assume their payment to our own citizen if instead of this the united states be to consent to a treaty by which mexico should again engage to pay the heavy amount of indebtedness which a just indemnity to our government and our citizen would impose on she it be notorious that she do not possess the mean to meet such an undertaking from such a treaty no result could be anticipate but the same irritate disappointment which have heretofore attend the violation of similar treaty stipulation on the part of mexico such a treaty would be but a temporary cessation of hostility without the restoration of the friendship and good understanding which should characterize the future intercourse between the two country
 that congress contemplate the acquisition of territorial indemnity when that body make provision for the prosecution of the war be obvious congress could not have mean when in may 1846 they appropriate $ 10,000,000 and authorize the president to employ the militia and naval and military force of the united states and to accept the service of 50,000 volunteer to enable he to prosecute the war and when at their last session and after our army have invade mexico they make additional appropriation and authorize the raising of additional troop for the same purpose that no indemnity be to be obtain from mexico at the conclusion of the war and yet it be certain that if no mexican territory be acquire no indemnity could be obtain it be far manifest that congress contemplate territorial indemnity from the fact that at their last session an act be pass upon the executive recommendation appropriate $ 3,000,000 with that express object this appropriation be make to enable the president to conclude a treaty of peace limit and boundary with the republic of mexico to be use by he in the event that say treaty when sign by the authorize agent of the two government and duly ratify by mexico shall call for the expenditure of the same or any part thereof the object of ask this appropriation be distinctly state in the several message on the subject which i communicate to congress similar appropriation make in 1803 and 1806 which be refer to be intend to be apply in part consideration for the cession of louisiana and the floridas in like manner it be anticipate that in settle the term of a treaty of limit and boundary with mexico a cession of territory estimate to be of great value than the amount of our demand against she might be obtain and that the prompt payment of this sum in part consideration for the territory cede on the conclusion of a treaty and its ratification on her part might be an inducement with she to make such a cession of territory as would be satisfactory to the united states and although the failure to conclude such a treaty have render it unnecessary to use any part of the $ 3,000,000 appropriate by that act and the entire sum remain in the treasury it be still applicable to that object should the contingency occur make such application proper
 the doctrine of no territory be the doctrine of no indemnity and if sanction would be a public acknowledgment that our country be wrong and that the war declare by congress with extraordinary unanimity be unjust and should be abandon an admission unfounded in fact and degrade to the national character
 the term of the treaty propose by the united states be not only just to mexico but consider the character and amount of our claim the unjustifiable and unprovoked commencement of hostility by she the expense of the war to which we have be subject and the success which have attend our arm be deem to be of a most liberal character
 the commissioner of the united states be authorize to agree to the establishment of the rio grande as the boundary from its entrance into the gulf to its intersection with the southern boundary of new mexico in north latitude about 32 degree and to obtain a cession to the united states of the provinces of new mexico and the californias and the privilege of the right of way across the isthmus of tehuantepec the boundary of the rio grande and the cession to the united states of new mexico and upper california constitute an ultimatum which our commissioner be under no circumstance to yield
 that it might be manif not only to mexico but to all other nation that the united states be not disposed to take advantage of a feeble power by insist upon wrestle from she all the other provinces include many of her principal town and city which we have conquer and hold in our military occupation but be willing to conclude a treaty in a spirit of liberality our commissioner be authorize to stipulate for the restoration to mexico of all our other conquest
 as the territory to be acquire by the boundary propose might be estimate to be of great value than a fair equivalent for our just demand our commissioner be authorize to stipulate for the payment of such additional pecuniary consideration as be deem reasonable
 the term of a treaty propose by the mexican commissioner be wholly inadmissible they negotiate as if mexico be the victorious and not the vanquished party they must have know that their ultimatum could never be accept it require the united states to dismember texas by surrender to mexico that part of the territory of that state lie between the nueces and the rio grande include within her limit by her law when she be an independent republic and when she be annex to the united states and admit by congress as one of the states of our union it contain no provision for the payment by mexico of the just claim of our citizen it require indemnity to mexican citizen for injury they may have sustain by our troop in the prosecution of the war it demand the right for mexico to levy and collect the mexican tariff of duty on good import into her port while in our military occupation during the war and the owner of which have pay to officer of the united states the military contribution which have be levy upon they and it offer to cede to the united states for a pecuniary consideration that part of upper california lie north of latitude 37&deg such be the unreasonable term propose by the mexican commissioner
 the cession to the united states by mexico of the provinces of new mexico and the californias as propose by the commissioner of the united states it be believe would be more in accordance with the convenience and interest of both nation than any other cession of territory which it be probable mexico could be induce to make
 it be manifest to all who have observe the actual condition of the mexican government for some year past and at present that if these province should be retain by she she could not long continue to hold and govern they mexico be too feeble a power to govern these province lie as they do at a distance of more than 1,000 mile from her capital and if attempt to be retain by she they would constitute but for a short time even nominally a part of her dominion this would be especially the case with upper california
 the sagacity of powerful european nation have long since direct their attention to the commercial importance of that province and there can be little doubt that the moment the united states shall relinquish their present occupation of it and their claim to it as indemnity an effort would be make by some foreign power to possess it either by conquest or by purchase if no foreign government should acquire it in either of these mode an independent revolutionary government would probably be establish by the inhabitant and such foreigner as may remain in or remove to the country as soon as it shall be know that the united states have abandon it such a government would be too feeble long to maintain its separate independent existence and would finally become annexed to or be a dependent colony of some more powerful state should any foreign government attempt to possess it as a colony or otherwise to incorporate it with itself the principle avow by president monroe in 1824 and reaffirm in my first annual message that no foreign power shall with our consent be permit to plant or establish any new colony or dominion on any part of the north american continent must be maintain in maintain this principle and in resist its invasion by any foreign power we might be involve in other war more expensive and more difficult than that in which we be now engage the provinces of new mexico and the californias be contiguous to the territory of the united states and if bring under the government of our law their resource mineral agricultural manufacturing and commercial would soon be develop
 upper california be bound on the north by our oregon possession and if hold by the united states would soon be settle by a hardy enterprising and intelligent portion of our population the bay of san francisco and other harbor along the californian coast would afford shelter for our navy for our numerous whale ship and other merchant vessel employ in the pacific ocean and would in a short period become the mart of an extensive and profitable commerce with china and other country of the east
 these advantage in which the whole commercial world would participate would at once be secure to the united states by the cession of this territory while it be certain that as long as it remain a part of the mexican dominion they can be enjoy neither by mexico herself nor by any other nation
 new mexico be a frontier province and have never be of any considerable value to mexico from its locality it be naturally connect with our western settlement the territorial limit of the state of texas too as define by her law before her admission into our union embrace all that portion of new mexico lie east of the rio grande while mexico still claim to hold this territory as a part of her dominion the adjustment of this question of boundary be important
 there be another consideration which induce the belief that the mexican government might even desire to place this province under the protection of the government of the united states numerous band of fierce and warlike savage wander over it and upon its border mexico have be and must continue to be too feeble to restrain they from commit depredation robbery and murder not only upon the inhabitant of new mexico itself but upon those of the other northern states of mexico it would be a blessing to all these northern states to have their citizen protect against they by the power of the united states at this moment many mexicans principally female and child be in captivity among they if new mexico be hold and govern by the united states we could effectually prevent these tribe from commit such outrage and compel they to release these captive and restore they to their family and friend
 in propose to acquire new mexico and the californias it be know that but an inconsiderable portion of the mexican people would be transfer with they the country embrace within these provinces be chiefly an uninhabited region
 these be the lead consideration which induce i to authorize the term of peace which be propose to mexico they be reject and negotiation be at an end hostility be renew an assault be make by our gallant army upon the strongly fortified place near the gate of the city of mexico and upon the city itself and after several day of severe conflict the mexican force vastly superior in number to our own be drive from the city and it be occupy by our troop
 immediately after information be receive of the unfavorable result of the negotiation believe that his continued presence with the army could be productive of no good i determine to recall our commissioner a dispatch to this effect be transmit to he on the 6th of october last the mexican government will be inform of his recall and that in the exist state of thing i shall not deem it proper to make any further overture of peace but shall be at all time ready to receive and consider any proposal which may be make by mexico
 since the liberal proposition of the united states be authorize to be make in april last large expenditure have be incur and the precious blood of many of our patriotic fellow citizen have be shed in the prosecution of the war this consideration and the obstinate perseverance of mexico in protract the war must influence the term of peace which it may be deem proper hereafter to accept our arm having be everywhere victorious having subject to our military occupation a large portion of the enemy&#39;s country include his capital and negotiation for peace having fail the important question arise in what manner the war ought to be prosecute and what should be our future policy i can not doubt that we should secure and render available the conquest which we have already make and that with this view we should hold and occupy by our naval and military force all the port town city and province now in our occupation or which may hereafter fall into our possession that we should press forward our military operation and levy such military contribution on the enemy as may as far as practicable defray the future expense of the war
 have the government of mexico accede to the equitable and liberal term propose that mode of adjustment would have be prefer mexico having decline to do this and fail to offer any other term which could be accept by the united states the national honor no less than the public interest require that the war should be prosecute with increase energy and power until a just and satisfactory peace can be obtain in the meantime as mexico refuse all indemnity we should adopt measure to indemnify ourselves by appropriate permanently a portion of her territory early after the commencement of the war new mexico and the californias be take possession of by our force our military and naval commander be order to conquer and hold they subject to be dispose of by a treaty of peace
 these provinces be now in our undisputed occupation and have be so for many month all resistance on the part of mexico having cease within their limit i be satisfied that they should never be surrender to mexico should congress concur with i in this opinion and that they should be retain by the united states as indemnity i can perceive no good reason why the civil jurisdiction and law of the united states should not at once be extend over they to wait for a treaty of peace such as we be willing to make by which our relation toward they would not be change can not be good policy whilst our own interest and that of the people inhabit they require that a stable responsible and free government under our authority should as soon as possible be establish over they should congress therefore determine to hold these province permanently and that they shall hereafter be consider as constituent part of our country the early establishment of territorial government over they will be important for the more perfect protection of person and property and i recommend that such territorial government be establish it will promote peace and tranquillity among the inhabitant by allay all apprehension that they may still entertain of be again subject to the jurisdiction of mexico i invite the early and favorable consideration of congress to this important subject
 besides new mexico and the californias there be other mexican provinces which have be reduce to our possession by conquest these other mexican provinces be now govern by our military and naval commander under the general authority which be confer upon a conqueror by the law of war they should continue to be hold as a means of coerce mexico to accede to just term of peace civil as well as military officer be require to conduct such a government adequate compensation to be draw from contribution levy on the enemy should be fix by law for such officer as may be thus employ what further provision may become necessary and what final disposition it may be proper to make of they must depend on the future progress of the war and the course which mexico may think proper hereafter to pursue
 with the view i entertain i can not favor the policy which have be suggest either to withdraw our army altogether or to retire to a designate line and simply hold and defend it to withdraw our army altogether from the conquest they have make by deed of unparalleled bravery and at the expense of so much blood and treasure in a just war on our part and one which by the act of the enemy we could not honorably have avoid would be to degrade the nation in its own estimation and in that of the world to retire to a line and simply hold and defend it would not terminate the war on the contrary it would encourage mexico to persevere and tend to protract it indefinitely it be not to be expect that mexico after refuse to establish such a line as a permanent boundary when our victorious army be in possession of her capital and in the heart of her country would permit we to hold it without resistance that she would continue the war and in the most harassing and annoying form there can be no doubt a border warfare of the most savage character extend over a long line would be unceasingly wage it would require a large army to be keep constantly in the field station at post and garrison along such a line to protect and defend it the enemy relieve from the pressure of our arm on his coast and in the populous part of the interior would direct his attention to this line and select an isolated post for attack would concentrate his force upon it this would be a condition of affair which the mexicans pursue their favorite system of guerrilla warfare would probably prefer to any other be we to assume a defensive attitude on such a line all the advantage of such a state of war would be on the side of the enemy we could levy no contribution upon he or in any other way make he feel the pressure of the war but must remain inactive and await his approach be in constant uncertainty at what point on the line or at what time he might make an assault he may assemble and organize an overwhelming force in the interior on his own side of the line and conceal his purpose make a sudden assault upon some one of our post so distant from any other as to prevent the possibility of timely succor or reenforcement and in this way our gallant army would be expose to the danger of be cut off in detail or if by their unequaled bravery and prowess everywhere exhibit during this war they should repulse the enemy their number station at any one post may be too small to pursue he if the enemy be repulse in one attack he would have nothing to do but to retreat to his own side of the line and be in no fear of a pursue army may reenforce himself at leisure for another attack on the same or some other post he may too cross the line between our post make rapid incursion into the country which we hold murder the inhabitant commit depredation on they and then retreat to the interior before a sufficient force can be concentrate to pursue he such would probably be the harass character of a mere defensive war on our part if our force when attack or threaten with attack be permit to cross the line drive back the enemy and conquer he this would be again to invade the enemy&#39;s country after having lose all the advantage of the conquest we have already make by having voluntarily abandon they to hold such a line successfully and in security it be far from be certain that it would not require as large an army as would be necessary to hold all the conquest we have already make and to continue the prosecution of the war in the heart of the enemy&#39;s country it be also far from be certain that the expense of the war would be diminish by such a policy i be persuade that the good mean of vindicate the national honor and interest and of bring the war to an honorable close will be to prosecute it with increase energy and power in the vital part of the enemy&#39;s country
 in my annual message to congress of december last i declare that-- the war have not be wage with a view to conquest but having be commence by mexico it have be carry into the enemy&#39;s country and will be vigorously prosecute there with a view to obtain an honorable peace and thereby secure ample indemnity for the expense of the war as well as to our much injure citizen who hold large pecuniary demand against mexico
 such in my judgment continue to be our true policy indeed the only policy which will probably secure a permanent peace
 it have never be contemplate by i as an object of the war to make a permanent conquest of the republic of mexico or to annihilate her separate existence as an independent nation on the contrary it have ever be my desire that she should maintain her nationality and under a good government adapt to her condition be a free independent and prosperous republic the united states be the first among the nation to recognize her independence and have always desire to be on term of amity and good neighborhood with she this she would not suffer by her own conduct we have be compel to engage in the present war in its prosecution we seek not her overthrow as a nation but in vindicate our national honor we seek to obtain redress for the wrong she have do we and indemnity for our just demand against she we demand an honorable peace and that peace must bring with it indemnity for the past and security for the future hitherto mexico have refuse all accommodation by which such a peace could be obtain
 whilst our army have advance from victory to victory from the commencement of the war it have always be with the olive branch of peace in their hand and it have be in the power of mexico at every step to arrest hostility by accept it
 one great obstacle to the attainment of peace have undoubtedly arise from the fact that mexico have be so long hold in subjection by one faction or military usurper after another and such have be the condition of insecurity in which their successive government have be place that each have be deter from make peace lest for this very cause a rival faction might expel it from power such be the fate of president herrera&#39;s administration in 1845 for be dispose even to listen to the overture of the united states to prevent the war as be fully confirm by an official correspondence which take place in the month of august last between he and his government a copy of which be herewith communicate for this cause alone the revolution which displace he from power be set on foot by general paredes such may be the condition of insecurity of the present government
 there can be no doubt that the peaceable and well dispose inhabitant of mexico be convince that it be the true interest of their country to conclude an honorable peace with the united states but the apprehension of become the victim of some military faction or usurper may have prevent they from manifest their feeling by any public act the removal of any such apprehension would probably cause they to speak their sentiment freely and to adopt the measure necessary for the restoration of peace with a people distract and divide by contend faction and a government subject to constant change by successive revolution the continue success of our arm may fail to secure a satisfactory peace in such event it may become proper for our command general in the field to give encouragement and assurance of protection to the friend of peace in mexico in the establishment and maintenance of a free republican government of their own choice able and willing to conclude a peace which would be just to they and secure to we the indemnity we demand this may become the only mode of obtain such a peace should such be the result the war which mexico have force upon we would thus be convert into an endure blessing to herself after find she torn and distract by faction and rule by military usurper we should then leave she with a republican government in the enjoyment of real independence and domestic peace and prosperity perform all her relative duty in the great family of nation and promote her own happiness by wise law and their faithful execution
 if after afford this encouragement and protection and after all the persevering and sincere effort we have make from the moment mexico commence the war and prior to that time to adjust our difference with she we shall ultimately fail then we shall have exhaust all honorable mean in pursuit of peace and must continue to occupy her country with our troop take the full measure of indemnity into our own hand and must enforce the term which our honor demand
 to act otherwise in the exist state of thing in mexico and to withdraw our army without a peace would not only leave all the wrong of which we complain unredressed but would be the signal for new and fierce civil dissension and new revolution all alike hostile to peaceful relation with the united states besides there be danger if our troop be withdraw before a peace be conduct that the mexican people weary with successive revolution and deprive of protection for their person and property might at length be inclined to yield to foreign influence and to cast themselves into the arm of some european monarch for protection from the anarchy and suffering which would ensue this for our own safety and in pursuance of our establish policy we should be compel to resist we could never consent that mexico should be thus convert into a monarchy govern by a foreign prince
 mexico be our near neighbor and her boundary be coterminous with our own through the whole extent across the north american continent from ocean to ocean both politically and commercially we have the deep interest in her regeneration and prosperity indeed it be impossible that with any just regard to our own safety we can ever become indifferent to her fate
 it may be that the mexican government and people have misconstrue or misunderstood our forbearance and our object in desire to conclude an amicable adjustment of the exist difference between the two country they may have suppose that we would submit to term degrade to the nation or they may have draw false inference from the suppose division of opinion in the united states on the subject of the war and may have calculate to gain much by protract it and indeed that we might ultimately abandon it altogether without insist on any indemnity territorial or otherwise whatever may be the false impression under which they have act the adoption and prosecution of the energetic policy propose must soon undeceive they
 in the future prosecution of the war the enemy must be make to feel its pressure more than they have heretofore do at its commencement it be deem proper to conduct it in a spirit of forbearance and liberality with this end in view early measure be adopt to conciliate as far as a state of war would permit the mass of the mexican population to convince they that the war be wage not against the peaceful inhabitant of mexico but against their faithless government which have commence hostility to remove from their mind the false impression which their designing and interested ruler have artfully attempt to make that the war on our part be one of conquest that it be a war against their religion and their church which be to be desecrate and overthrow and that their right of person and private property would be violate to remove these false impression our commander in the field be direct scrupulously to respect their religion their church and their church property which be in no manner to be violate they be direct also to respect the right of person and property of all who should not take up arm against we
 assurance to this effect be give to the mexican people by major general taylor in a proclamation issue in pursuance of instruction from the secretary of war in the month of june 1846 and again by major general scott who act upon his own conviction of the propriety of issue it in a proclamation of the 11th of may 1847 in this spirit of liberality and conciliation and with a view to prevent the body of the mexican population from take up arm against we be the war conduct on our part provision and other supply furnish to our army by mexican citizen be pay for at fair and liberal price agree upon by the party after the lapse of a few month it become apparent that these assurance and this mild treatment have fail to produce the desire effect upon the mexican population while the war have be conduct on our part accord to the most humane and liberal principle observe by civilized nation it be wage in a far different spirit on the part of mexico not appreciate our forbearance the mexican people generally become hostile to the united states and avail themselves of every opportunity to commit the most savage excess upon our troop large number of the population take up arm and engage in guerrilla warfare rob and murder in the most cruel manner individual soldier or small party whom accident or other cause have separate from the main body of our army band of guerrillero and robber infest the road harass our train and whenever it be in their power cut off our supply
 the mexicans having thus show themselves to be wholly incapable of appreciate our forbearance and liberality it be deem proper to change the manner of conduct the war by make they feel its pressure accord to the usage observe under similar circumstance by all other civilized nation
 accordingly as early as the 22d of september 1846 instruction be give by the secretary of war to major general taylor to draw supply for our army from the enemy without pay for they and to require contribution for its support if in that way he be satisfied he could get abundant supply for his force in direct the execution of these instruction much be necessarily leave to the discretion of the command officer who be well acquaint with the circumstance by which he be surround the want of the army and the practicability of enforce the measure general taylor on the 26th of october 1846 reply from monterey that it would have be impossible hitherto and be so now to sustain the army to any extent by force contribution of money or supply for the reason assign by he he do not adopt the policy of his instruction but declare his readiness to do so should the army in its future operation reach a portion of the country which may be make to supply the troop with advantage he continue to pay for the article of supply which be draw from the enemy&#39;s country
 similar instruction be issue to major general scott on the 3d of april 1847 who reply from jalapa on the 20th of may 1847 that if it be expect that the army be to support itself by force contribution levy upon the country we may ruin and exasperate the inhabitant and starve ourselves the same discretion be give to he that have be to general taylor in this respect general scott for the reason assign by he also continue to pay for the article of supply for the army which be draw from the enemy
 after the army have reach the heart of the most wealthy portion of mexico it be suppose that the obstacle which have before that time prevent it would not be such as to render impracticable the levy of force contribution for its support and on the 1st of september and again on the 6th of october 1847 the order be repeat in dispatch address by the secretary of war to general scott and his attention be again call to the importance of make the enemy bear the burden of the war by require they to furnish the mean of support our army and he be direct to adopt this policy unless by do so there be danger of deprive the army of the necessary supply copy of these dispatch be forward to general taylor for his government
 on the 31st of march last i cause an order to be issue to our military and naval commander to levy and collect a military contribution upon all vessel and merchandise which might enter any of the port of mexico in our military occupation and to apply such contribution toward defray the expense of the war by virtue of the right of conquest and the law of war the conqueror consult his own safety or convenience may either exclude foreign commerce altogether from all such port or permit it upon such term and condition as he may prescribe before the principal port of mexico be blockade by our navy the revenue derive from import duty under the law of mexico be pay into the mexican treasury after these port have fall into our military possession the blockade be raise and commerce with they permit upon prescribe term and condition they be open to the trade of all nation upon the payment of duty more moderate in their amount than those which have be previously levy by mexico and the revenue which be formerly pay into the mexican treasury be direct to be collect by our military and naval officer and apply to the use of our army and navy care be take that the officer soldier and sailor of our army and navy should be exempt from the operation of the order and as the merchandise import upon which the order operate must be consume by mexican citizen the contribution exact be in effect the seizure of the public revenue of mexico and the application of they to our own use in direct this measure the object be to compel the enemy to contribute as far as practicable toward the expense of the war
 for the amount of contribution which have be levy in this form i refer you to the accompany report of the secretary of war and of the secretary of the navy by which it appear that a sum exceed half a million of dollar have be collect this amount would undoubtedly have be much large but for the difficulty of keep open communication between the coast and the interior so as to enable the owner of the merchandise import to transport and vend it to the inhabitant of the country it be confidently expect that this difficulty will to a great extent be soon remove by our increase force which have be send to the field
 measure have recently be adopt by which the internal as well as the external revenue of mexico in all place in our military occupation will be seize and appropriate to the use of our army and navy
 the policy of levy upon the enemy contribution in every form consistently with the law of nation which it may be practicable for our military commander to adopt should in my judgment be rigidly enforce and order to this effect have accordingly be give by such a policy at the same time that our own treasury will be relieve from a heavy drain the mexican people will be make to feel the burden of the war and consult their own interest may be induce the more readily to require their ruler to accede to a just peace
 after the adjournment of the last session of congress event transpire in the prosecution of the war which in my judgment require a great number of troop in the field than have be anticipate the strength of the army be accordingly increase by accept the service of all the volunteer force authorize by the act of the 13th of may 1846 without put a construction on that act the correctness of which be seriously question the volunteer force now in the field with those which have be accept to serve for twelve month and be discharge at the end of their term of service exhaust the 50,000 man authorize by that act have it be clear that a proper construction of the act warrant it the service of an additional number would have be call for and accept but doubt exist upon this point the power be not exercise it be deem important that congress should at an early period of their session confer the authority to raise an additional regular force to serve during the war with mexico and to be discharge upon the conclusion and ratification of a treaty of peace i invite the attention of congress to the view present by the secretary of war in his report upon this subject
 i recommend also that authority be give by law to call for and accept the service of an additional number of volunteer to be exercise at such time and to such extent as the emergency of the service may require
 in prosecute the war with mexico whilst the utmost care have be take to avoid every just cause of complaint on the part of neutral nation and none have be give liberal privilege have be grant to their commerce in the port of the enemy in our military occupation the difficulty with the brazilian government which at one time threaten to interrupt the friendly relation between the two country will i trust be speedily adjust i have receive information that an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the united states will shortly be appoint by his imperial majesty and it be hope that he will come instruct and prepare to adjust all remain difference between the two government in a manner acceptable and honorable to both in the meantime i have every reason to believe that nothing will occur to interrupt our amicable relation with brazil
 it have be my constant effort to maintain and cultivate the most intimate relation of friendship with all the independent power of south america and this policy have be attend with the happy result it be true that the settlement and payment of many just claim of american citizen against these nation have be long delay the peculiar position in which they have be place and the desire on the part of my predecessor as well as myself to grant they the utmost indulgence have hitherto prevent these claim from be urge in a manner demand by strict justice the time have arrive when they ought to be finally adjust and liquidate and effort be now make for that purpose
 it be proper to inform you that the government of peru have in good faith pay the first two installment of the indemnity of $ 30,000 each and the great portion of the interest due thereon in execution of the convention between that government and the united states the ratification of which be exchange at lima on the 31st of october 1846 the attorney general of the united states early in august last complete the adjudication of the claim under this convention and make his report thereon in pursuance of the act of the 8th of august 1846 the sum to which the claimant be respectively entitled will be pay on demand at the treasury
 i invite the early attention of congress to the present condition of our citizen in china under our treaty with that power american citizen be withdraw from the jurisdiction whether civil or criminal of the chinese government and place under that of our public functionary in that country by these alone can our citizen be try and punish for the commission of any crime by these alone can question be decide between they involve the right of person and property and by these alone can contract be enforce into which they may have enter with the citizen or subject of foreign power the merchant vessel of the united states lie in the water of the five port of china open to foreign commerce be under the exclusive jurisdiction of officer of their own government until congress shall establish competent tribunal to try and punish crime and to exercise jurisdiction in civil case in china american citizen there be subject to no law whatever crime may be commit with impunity and debt may be contract without any mean to enforce their payment inconvenience have already result from the omission of congress to legislate upon the subject and still great be apprehend the british authority in china have already complain that this government have not provide for the punishment of crime or the enforcement of contract against american citizen in that country whilst their government have establish tribunal by which an american citizen can recover debt due from british subject accustom as the chinese be to summary justice they could not be make to comprehend why criminal who be citizen of the united states should escape with impunity in violation of treaty obligation whilst the punishment of a chinese who have commit any crime against an american citizen would be rigorously exact indeed the consequence might be fatal to american citizen in china should a flagrant crime be commit by any one of they upon a chinese and should trial and punishment not follow accord to the requisition of the treaty this might disturb if not destroy our friendly relation with that empire and cause an interruption of our valuable commerce our treaty with the sublime porte tripoli tunis morocco and muscat also require the legislation of congress to carry they into execution though the necessity for immediate action may not be so urgent as in regard to china
 the secretary of state have submit an estimate to defray the expense of open diplomatic relation with the papal states the interesting political event now in progress in these states as well as a just regard to our commercial interest have in my opinion render such a measure highly expedient
 estimate have also be submit for the outfit and salary of charges&#39 d&#39;affaire to the republics of bolivia guatemala and ecuador the manifest importance of cultivate the most friendly relation with all the independent states upon this continent have induce i to recommend appropriation necessary for the maintenance of these mission
 i recommend to congress that an appropriation be make to be pay to the spanish government for the purpose of distribution among the claimant in the amistad case i entertain the conviction that this be due to spain under the treaty of the 20th of october 1795 and moreover that from the earnest manner in which the claim continue to be urge so long as it shall remain unsettled it will be a source of irritation and discord between the two country which may prove highly prejudicial to the interest of the united states good policy no less than a faithful compliance with our treaty obligation require that the inconsiderable appropriation demand should be make

 the expenditure for the same period if peace with mexico shall not be conclude and the army shall be increase as be propose will amount include the necessary payment on account of principal and interest of the public debt and treasury note to $ 58,615,660.07 on the 1st of the present month the amount of the public debt actually incur include treasury note be $ 45,659,659.40 the public debt due on the 4th of march 1845 include treasury note be $ 17,788,799.62 and consequently the addition make to the public debt since that time be $ 27,870,859.78
 of the loan of twenty three million authorize by the act of the 28th of january 1847 the sum of five million be pay out to the public creditor or exchange at par for specie the remain eighteen million be offer for specie to the high bidder not below par by an advertisement issue by the secretary of the treasury and publish from the 9th of february until the 10th of april 1847 when it be award to the several high bidder at premium vary from one eighth of per cent to 2 per cent above par the premium have be pay into the treasury and the sum award deposit in specie in the treasury as fast as it be require by the want of the government
 to meet the expenditure for the remainder of the present and for the next fiscal year end on the 30th of june 1849 a further loan in aid of the ordinary revenue of the government will be necessary retain a sufficient surplus in the treasury the loan require for the remainder of the present fiscal year will be about $ 18,500,000 if the duty on tea and coffee be impose and the graduation of the price of the public land shall be make at an early period of your session as recommend the loan for the present fiscal year may be reduce to $ 17,000,000 the loan may be far reduce by whatever amount of expenditure can be save by military contribution collect in mexico the most vigorous measure for the augmentation of these contribution have be direct and a very considerable sum be expect from that source its amount can not however be calculate with any certainty it be recommend that the loan to be make be authorize upon the same term and for the same time as that which be authorize under the provision of the act of the 28th of january 1847
 should the war with mexico be continue until the 30th of june 1849 it be estimate that a further loan of $ 20,500,000 will be require for the fiscal year end on that day in case no duty be impose on tea and coffee and the public land be not reduce and graduate in price and no military contribution shall be collect in mexico if the duty on tea and coffee be impose and the land be reduce and graduate in price as propose the loan may be reduce to $ 17,000,000 and will be subject to be still far reduce by the amount of the military contribution which may be collect in mexico it be not propose however at present to ask congress for authority to negotiate this loan for the next fiscal year as it be hope that the loan ask for the remainder of the present fiscal year aid by military contribution which may be collect in mexico may be sufficient if contrary to my expectation there should be a necessity for it the fact will be communicate to congress in time for their action during the present session in no event will a sum exceed $ 6,000,000 of this amount be need before the meeting of the session of congress in december 1848
 the act of the 30th of july 1846 reduce the duty on import have be in force since the 1st of december last and i be gratified to state that all the beneficial effect which be anticipate from its operation have be fully realize the public revenue derive from custom during the year end on the 1st of december 1847 exceed by more than $ 8,000,000 the amount receive in the precede year under the operation of the act of 1842 which be supersede and repeal by it its effect be visible in the great and almost unexampled prosperity which prevail in every branch of business
 while the repeal of the prohibitory and restrictive duty of the act of 1842 and the substitution in their place of reasonable revenue rate levy on article import accord to their actual value have increase the revenue and augment our foreign trade all the great interest of the country have be advance and promote
 the great and important interest of agriculture which have be not only too much neglect but actually tax under the protective policy for the benefit of other interest have be relieve of the burden which that policy impose on they and our farmer and planter under a more just and liberal commercial policy be find new and profitable market abroad for their augmented product our commerce be rapidly increase and be extend more widely the circle of international exchange great as have be the increase of our import during the past year our export of domestic product sell in foreign market have be still great
 our navigate interest be eminently prosperous the number of vessel build in the united states have be great than during any precede period of equal length large profit have be derive by those who have construct as well as by those who have navigate they should the ratio of increase in the number of our merchant vessel be progressive and be as great for the future as during the past year the time be not distant when our tonnage and commercial marine will be large than that of any other nation in the world
 whilst the interest of agriculture of commerce and of navigation have be enlarge and invigorate it be highly gratifying to observe that our manufacture be also in a prosperous condition none of the ruinous effect upon this interest which be apprehend by some as the result of the operation of the revenue system establish by the act of 1846 have be experience on the contrary the number of manufactory and the amount of capital invest in they be steadily and rapidly increase afford gratify proof that american enterprise and skill employ in this branch of domestic industry with no other advantage than those fairly and incidentally accruing from a just system of revenue duty be abundantly able to meet successfully all competition from abroad and still derive fair and remunerate profit while capital invest in manufacture be yield adequate and fair profit under the new system the wage of labor whether employ in manufacture agriculture commerce or navigation have be augment the toil million whose daily labor furnish the supply of food and raiment and all the necessary and comfort of life be receive high wage and more steady and permanent employment than in any other country or at any previous period of our own history
 so successful have be all branch of our industry that a foreign war which generally diminish the resource of a nation have in no essential degree retard our onward progress or check our general prosperity
 with such gratifying evidence of prosperity and of the successful operation of the revenue act of 1846 every consideration of public policy recommend that it shall remain unchanged it be hope that the system of impost duty which it establish may be regard as the permanent policy of the country and that the great interest affect by it may not again be subject to be injuriously disturb as they have heretofore be by frequent and sometimes sudden change
 for the purpose of increase the revenue and without change or modify the rate impose by the act of 1846 on the dutiable article embrace by its provision i again recommend to your favorable consideration the expediency of levy a revenue duty on tea and coffee the policy which exempt these article from duty during peace and when the revenue to be derive from they be not need cease to exist when the country be engage in war and require the use of all of its available resource it be a tax which would be so generally diffuse among the people that it would be feel oppressively by none and be complain of by none it be believe that there be not in the list of import article any which be more properly the subject of war duty than tea and coffee
 it be estimate that $ 3,000,000 would be derive annually by a moderate duty impose on these article
 should congress avail itself of this additional source of revenue not only would the amount of the public loan render necessary by the war with mexico be diminish to that extent but the public credit and the public confidence in the ability and determination of the government to meet all its engagement promptly would be more firmly establish and the reduced amount of the loan which it may be necessary to negotiate could probably be obtain at cheap rate
 congress be therefore call upon to determine whether it be wise to impose the war duty recommend or by omit to do so increase the public debt annually $ 3,000,000 so long as loan shall be require to prosecute the war and afterwards provide in some other form to pay the semiannual interest upon it and ultimately to extinguish the principal if in addition to these duty congress should graduate and reduce the price of such of the public land as experience have prove will not command the price place upon they by the government an additional annual income to the treasury of between half a million and a million of dollar it be estimate would be derive from this source should both measure receive the sanction of congress the annual amount of public debt necessary to be contract during the continuance of the war would be reduce near $ 4,000,000 the duty recommend to be levy on tea and coffee it be propose shall be limit in their duration to the end of the war and until the public debt render necessary to be contract by it shall be discharge the amount of the public debt to be contract should be limit to the low practicable sum and should be extinguish as early after the conclusion of the war as the mean of the treasury will permit
 with this view it be recommend that as soon as the war shall be over all the surplus in the treasury not need for other indispensable object shall constitute a sink fund and be apply to the purchase of the fund debt and that authority be confer by law for that purpose the act of the 6th of august 1846 to establish a warehousing system have be in operation more than a year and have prove to be an important auxiliary to the tariff act of 1846 in augment the revenue and extend the commerce of the country whilst it have tend to enlarge commerce it have be beneficial to our manufacture by diminish force sale at auction of foreign good at low price to raise the duty to be advanced on they and by check fluctuation in the market the system although sanction by the experience of other country be entirely new in the united states and be susceptible of improvement in some of its provision the secretary of the treasury upon whom be devolve large discretionary power in carry this measure into effect have collect and be now collate the practical result of the system in other country where it have long be establish and will report at an early period of your session such further regulation suggest by the investigation as may render it still more effective and beneficial
 by the act to provide for the well organization of the treasury and for the collection safe keeping and disbursement of the public revenue all bank be discontinue as fiscal agent of the government and the paper currency issue by they be no long permit to be receive in payment of public due the constitutional treasury create by this act go into operation on the 1st of january last under the system establish by it the public money have be collect safely keep and disburse by the direct agency of officer of the government in gold and silver and transfer of large amount have be make from point of collection to point of disbursement without loss to the treasury or injury or inconvenience to the trade of the country
 while the fiscal operation of the government have be conduct with regularity and ease under this system it have have a salutary effect in check and prevent an undue inflation of the paper currency issue by the bank which exist under state charter require as it do all due to the government to be pay in gold and silver its effect be to restrain excessive issue of bank paper by the bank disproportione to the specie in their vault for the reason that they be at all time liable to be call on by the holder of their note for their redemption in order to obtain specie for the payment of duty and other public due the bank therefore must keep their business within prudent limit and be always in a condition to meet such call or run the hazard of be compel to suspend specie payment and be thereby discredit the amount of specie import into the united states during the last fiscal year be $ 24,121,289 of which there be retain in the country $ 22,276,170 have the former financial system prevail and the public money be place on deposit in the bank nearly the whole of this amount would have go into their vault not to be throw into circulation by they but to be withhold from the hand of the people as a currency and make the basis of new and enormous issue of bank paper a large proportion of the specie import have be pay into the treasury for public due and after having be to a great extent recoine at the mint have be pay out to the public creditor and go into circulation as a currency among the people the amount of gold and silver coin now in circulation in the country be large than at any former period
 the financial system establish by the constitutional treasury have be thus far eminently successful in its operation and i recommend an adherence to all its essential provision and especially to that vital provision which wholly separate the government from all connection with bank and exclude bank paper from all revenue receipt
 in some of its detail not involve its general principle the system be defective and will require modification these defect and such amendment as be deem important be set forth in the last annual report of the secretary of the treasury these amendment be again recommend to the early and favorable consideration of congress
 during the past year the coinage at the mint and its branch have exceed $ 20,000,000 this have consist chiefly in convert the coin of foreign country into american coin
 the large amount of foreign coin import have be receive at new york and if a branch mint be establish at that city all the foreign coin receive at that port could at once be convert into our own coin without the expense risk and delay of transport it to the mint for that purpose and the amount recoine would be much large
 experience have prove that foreign coin and especially foreign gold coin will not circulate extensively as a currency among the people the important measure of extend our specie circulation both of gold and silver and of diffuse it among the people can only be effect by convert such foreign coin into american coin i repeat the recommendation contain in my last annual message for the establishment of a branch of the mint of the united states at the city of new york
 all the public land which have be survey and be ready for market have be proclaim for sale during the past year the quantity offer and to be offer for sale under proclamation issue since the 1st of january last amount to 9,138,531 acre the prosperity of the western states and territories in which these land lie will be advance by their speedy sale by withhold they from market their growth and increase of population would be retard while thousand of our enterprising and meritorious frontier population would be deprive of the opportunity of secure freehold for themselves and their family but in addition to the general consideration which render the early sale of these land proper it be a lead object at this time to derive as large a sum as possible from this source and thus diminish by that amount the public loan render necessary by the existence of a foreign war
 it be estimate that not less than 10,000,000 acre of the public land will be survey and be in a condition to be proclaim for sale during the year 1848
 in my last annual message i present the reason which in my judgment render it proper to graduate and reduce the price of such of the public land as have remain unsold for long period after they have be offer for sale at public auction
 many million of acre of public land lie within the limit of several of the western states have be offer in the market and be subject to sale at private entry for more than twenty year and large quantity for more than thirty year at the low price prescribe by the exist law and it have be find that they will not command that price they must remain unsold and uncultivated for an indefinite period unless the price demand for they by the government shall be reduce no satisfactory reason be perceive why they should be long hold at rate above their real value at the present period an additional reason exist for adopt the measure recommend when the country be engage in a foreign war and we must necessarily resort to loan it would seem to be the dictate of wisdom that we should avail ourselves of all our resource and thus limit the amount of the public indebtedness to the low possible sum
 i recommend that the exist law on the subject of preemption right be amend and modify so as to operate prospectively and to embrace all who may settle upon the public land and make improvement upon they before they be survey as well as afterwards in all case where such settlement may be make after the indian title shall have be extinguish
 if the right of preemption be thus extend it will embrace a large and meritorious class of our citizen it will increase the number of small freeholder upon our border who will be enable thereby to educate their child and otherwise improve their condition while they will be find at all time as they have ever prove themselves to be in the hour of danger to their country among our hardy and good volunteer soldier ever ready to attend to their service in case of emergency and among the last to leave the field as long as an enemy remain to be encounter such a policy will also impress these patriotic pioneer emigrant with deep feeling of gratitude for the parental care of their government when they find their dear interest secure to they by the permanent law of the land and that they be no long in danger of lose their home and hard earn improvement by be bring into competition with a more wealthy class of purchaser at the land sale the attention of congress be invite at their last and the precede session to the importance of establish a territorial government over our possession in oregon and it be to be regret that there be no legislation on the subject our citizen who inhabit that distant region of country be still leave without the protection of our law or any regularly organize government before the question of limit and boundary of the territory of oregon be definitely settle from the necessity of their condition the inhabitant have establish a temporary government of their own besides the want of legal authority for continue such a government it be wholly inadequate to protect they in their right of person and property or to secure to they the enjoyment of the privilege of other citizen to which they be entitle under the constitution of the united states they should have the right of suffrage be represent in a territorial legislature and by a delegate in congress and possess all the right and privilege which citizen of other portion of the territory of the united states have heretofore enjoy or may now enjoy
 our judicial system revenue law law regulate trade and intercourse with the indian tribe and the protection of our law generally should be extend over they
 in addition to the inhabitant in that territory who have previously emigrate to it large number of our citizen have follow they during the present year and it be not doubted that during the next and subsequent year their number will be greatly increase
 congress at its last session establish post route lead to oregon and between different point within that territory and authorize the establishment of post office at astoria and such other place on the coast of the pacific within the territory of the united states as the public interest may require post office have accordingly be establish deputy postmaster appoint and provision make for the transportation of the mail
 the preservation of peace with the indian tribe reside west of the rocky mountains will render it proper that authority should be give by law for the appointment of an adequate number of indian agent to reside among they
 i recommend that a surveyor general&#39;s office be establish in that territory and that the public land be survey and bring into market at an early period
 i recommend also that grant upon liberal term of limited quantity of the public land be make to all citizen of the united states who have emigrate or may hereafter within a prescribed period emigrate to oregon and settle upon they these hardy and adventurous citizen who have encounter the danger and privation of a long and toilsome journey and have at length find an abide place for themselves and their family upon the utmost verge of our western limit should be secure in the home which they have improve by their labor i refer you to the accompany report of the secretary of war for a detailed account of the operation of the various branch of the public service connect with the department under his charge the duty devolve on this department have be unusually onerous and responsible during the past year and have be discharge with ability and success
 pacific relation continue to exist with the various indian tribe and most of they manifest a strong friendship for the united states some depredation be commit during the past year upon our train transport supply for the army on the road between the western border of missouri and santa fe these depredation which be suppose to have be commit by band from the region of new mexico have be arrest by the presence of a military force order out for that purpose some outrage have be perpetrate by a portion of the northwestern band upon the weak and comparatively defenseless neighboring tribe prompt measure be take to prevent such occurrence in future
 between 1,000 and 2,000 indians belong to several tribe have be remove during the year from the east of the mississippi to the country allot to they west of that river as their permanent home and arrangement have be make for other to follow
 since the treaty of 1846 with the cherokees the feud among they appear to have subside and they have become more united and content than they have be for many year past the commissioner appoint in pursuance of the act of june 27 1846 to settle claim arise under the treaty of 1835 36 with that tribe have execute their duty and after a patient investigation and a full and fair examination of all the case bring before they close their labor in the month of july last this be the fourth board of commissioner which have be organize under this treaty ample opportunity have be afford to all those interested to bring forward their claim no doubt be entertain that impartial justice have be do by the late board and that all valid claim embrace by the treaty have be consider and allow this result and the final settlement to be make with this tribe under the treaty of 1846 which will be complete and lay before you during your session will adjust all question of controversy between they and the united states and produce a state of relation with they simple well define and satisfactory under the discretionary authority confer by the act of the 3d of march last the annuity due to the various tribe have be pay during the present year to the head of family instead of to their chief or such person as they might designate as require by the law previously exist this mode of payment have give general satisfaction to the great body of the indians justice have be do to they and they be grateful to the government for it a few chief and interested person may object to this mode of payment but it be believe to be the only mode of prevent fraud and imposition from be practice upon the great body of common indians constitute a majority of all the tribe it be gratify to perceive that a number of the tribe have recently manifest an increase interest in the establishment of school among they and be make rapid advance in agriculture some of they produce a sufficient quantity of food for their support and in some case a surplus to dispose of to their neighbor the comfort by which those who have receive even a very limited education and have engage in agriculture be surround tend gradually to draw off their less civilized brother from the precarious mean of subsistence by the chase to habit of labor and civilization
 the accompanying report of the secretary of the navy present a satisfactory and gratifying account of the condition and operation of the naval service during the past year our commerce have be pursue with increase activity and with safety and success in every quarter of the globe under the protection of our flag which the navy have cause to be respect in the most distant sea
 in the gulf of mexico and in the pacific the officer and man of our squadron have display distinguished gallantry and perform valuable service in the early stage of the war with mexico her port on both coast be blockade and more recently many of they have be capture and hold by the navy when act in cooperation with the land force the naval officer and man have perform gallant and distinguished service on land as well as on water and deserve the high commendation of the country
 while other maritime power be add to their navy large number of war steamer it be a wise policy on our part to make similar addition to our navy the four war steamer authorize by the act of the 3d of march 1847 be in course of construction
 in addition to the four war steamer authorize by this act the secretary of the navy have in pursuance of its provision enter into contract for the construction of five steamer to be employ in the transportation of the united states mail from new york to new orleans touch at charleston savannah and havana and from havana to chagre for three steamer to be employ in like manner from panama to oregon so as to connect with the mail from havana to chagres across the isthmus and for five steamer to be employ in like manner from new york to liverpool these steamer will be the property of the contractor but be to be build under the superintendence and direction of a naval constructor in the employ of the navy department and to be so construct as to render they convertible at the least possible expense into war steamer of the first class a prescribed number of naval officer as well as a post office agent be to be on board of they and authority be reserve to the navy department at all time to exercise control over say steamship and to have the right to take they for the exclusive use and service of the united states upon make proper compensation to the contractor therefor
 whilst these steamship will be employ in transport the mail of the united states coastwise and to foreign country upon an annual compensation to be pay to the owner they will be always ready upon an emergency require it to be convert into war steamer and the right reserve to take they for public use will add greatly to the efficiency and strength of this description of our naval force to the steamer thus authorize under contract make by the secretary of the navy should be add five other steamer authorize under contract make in pursuance of law by the postmaster general make an addition in the whole of eighteen war steamer subject to be take for public use as further contract for the transportation of the mail to foreign country may be authorize by congress this number may be enlarge indefinitely
 the enlightened policy by which a rapid communication with the various distant part of the globe be establish by mean of american build sea steamer would find an ample reward in the increase of our commerce and in make our country and its resource more favorably know abroad but the national advantage be still great of have our naval officer make familiar with steam navigation and of have the privilege of take the ship already equip for immediate service at a moment&#39;s notice and will be cheaply purchase by the compensation to be pay for the transportation of the mail in they over and above the postage receive
 a just national pride no less than our commercial interest would seem to favor the policy of augment the number of this description of vessel they can be build in our country cheap and in great number than in any other in the world
 i refer you to the accompany report of the postmaster general for a detailed and satisfactory account of the condition and operation of that department during the past year it be gratify to find that within so short a period after the reduction in the rate of postage and notwithstanding the great increase of mail service the revenue receive for the year will be sufficient to defray all the expense and that no further aid will be require from the treasury for that purpose
 the first of the american mail steamer authorize by the act of the 3d of march 1845 be complete and enter upon the service on the 1st of june last and be now on her third voyage to bremen and other intermediate port the other vessel authorize under the provision of that act be in course of construction and will be put upon the line as soon as complete contract have also be make for the transportation of the mail in a steamer from charleston to havana
 a reciprocal and satisfactory postal arrangement have be make by the postmaster general with the authority of bremen and no difficulty be apprehend in make similar arrangement with all other power with which we may have communication by mail steamer except with great britain
 on the arrival of the first of the american steamer bind to bremen at southampton in the month of june last the british post office direct the collection of discriminate postage on all letter and other mailable matter which she take out to great britain or which go into the british post office on their way to france and other part of europe the effect of the order of the british post office be to subject all letter and other matter transport by american steamer to double postage one postage having be previously pay on they to the united states while letter transport in british steamer be subject to pay but a single postage this measure be adopt with the avow object of protect the british line of mail steamer now run between boston and liverpool and if permit to continue must speedily put an end to the transportation of all letter and other matter by american steamer and give to british steamer a monopoly of the business a just and fair reciprocity be all that we desire and on this we must insist by our law no such discrimination be make against british steamer bring letter into our port but all letter arrive in the united states be subject to the same rate of postage whether bring in british or american vessel i refer you to the report of the postmaster general for a full statement of the fact of the case and of the step take by he to correct this inequality he have exert all the power confer upon he by the exist law
 the minister of the united states at london have bring the subject to the attention of the british government and be now engage in negotiation for the purpose of adjust reciprocal postal arrangement which shall be equally just to both country should he fail in conclude such arrangement and should great britain insist on enforce the unequal and unjust measure she have adopt it will become necessary to confer additional power on the postmaster general in order to enable he to meet the emergency and to put our own steamer on an equal footing with british steamer engage in transport the mail between the two country and i recommend that such power be confer in view of the exist state of our country i trust it may not be inappropriate in close this communication to call to mind the word of wisdom and admonition of the first and most illustrious of my predecessor in his farewell address to his countryman
 that great and good of man who serve his country so long and love it so much foresaw with serious concern the danger to our union of characterize party by geographical discrimination northern and southern atlantic and western whence design man may endeavor to excite a belief that there be a real difference of local interest and view and warn his countryman against it
 so deep and solemn be his conviction of the importance of the union and of preserve harmony between its different part that he declare to his countryman in that address
 it be of infinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of your national union to your collective and individual happiness that you should cherish a cordial habitual and immovable attachment to it accustom yourself to think and speak of it as of the palladium of your political safety and prosperity watch for its preservation with jealous anxiety discountenance whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandon and indignantly frown upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred tie which now link together the various part
 after the lapse of half a century these admonition of washington fall upon we with all the force of truth it be difficult to estimate the immense value of our glorious union of confederate states to which we be so much indebted for our growth in population and wealth and for all that constitute we a great and a happy nation how unimportant be all our difference of opinion upon minor question of public policy compare with its preservation and how scrupulously should we avoid all agitate topic which may tend to distract and divide we into contend party separate by geographical line whereby it may be weaken or endanger
 invoke the blessing of the almighty ruler of the universe upon your deliberation it will be my high duty no less than my sincere pleasure to cooperate with you in all measure which may tend to promote the honor and endure welfare of our common country

 i lay before congress the accompany memorial and paper which have be transmit to i by a special messenger employ for that purpose by the governor and legislative assembly of oregon territory who constitute the temporary government which the inhabitant of that distant region of our country have from the necessity of their condition organize for themselves the memorialist be citizen of the united states they express ardent attachment to their native land and in their present perilous and distressed situation they earnestly invoke the aid and protection of their government
 they represent that the proud and powerful tribe of indians reside in their vicinity have recently raise the war whoop and crimson their tomahawk in the blood of their citizen that they apprehend that many of the powerful tribe inhabit the upper valley of the columbia have form an alliance for the purpose of carry on hostility against their settlement that the number of the white population be far inferior to that of the savage that they be deficient in arm and money and fear that they do not possess strength to repel the attack of so formidable a foe and protect their family and property from violence and rapine they conclude their appeal to the government of the united states for relief by declare
 if it be at all the intention of our honored parent to spread her guardian wing over her son and daughter in oregon she surely will not refuse to do it now when they be struggle with all the ill of a weak and temporary government and when peril be daily thicken around they and prepare to burst upon their head when the ensue summer&#39;s sun shall have dispel the snow from the mountain we shall look with glow hope and restless anxiety for the coming of your law and your arm
 in my message of the 5th of august 1846 communicate a copy of the convention for the settlement and adjustment of the oregon boundary i recommend to congress that provision should be make by law at the early practicable period for the organization of a territorial government in oregon in my annual message of december 1846 and again in december 1847 this recommendation be repeat
 the population of oregon be believe to exceed 12,000 soul and it be know that it will be increase by a large number of emigrant during the present season the fact set forth in the accompany memorial and paper show that the danger to which our fellow citizen be expose be so imminent that i deem it to be my duty again to impress on congress the strong claim which the inhabitant of that distant country have to the benefit of our law and to the protection of our government
 i therefore again invite the attention of congress to the subject and recommend that law be promptly pass establish a territorial government and grant authority to raise an adequate volunteer force for the defense and protection of its inhabitant it be believe that a regiment of mount man with such additional force as may be raise in oregon will be sufficient to afford the require protection it be recommend that the force raise for this purpose should engage to serve for twelve month unless soon discharge no doubt be entertain that with proper inducement in land bounty such a force can be raise in a short time upon the expiration of their service many of they will doubtless desire to remain in the country and settle upon the land which they may receive as bounty it be deem important that provision be make for the appointment of a suitable number of indian agent to reside among the various tribe m oregon and that appropriation be make to enable they to treat with these tribe with a view to restore and preserve peace between they and the white inhabitant
 should the law recommend be promptly pass the measure for their execution may be complete during the present season and before the severity of winter will interpose obstacle in cross the rocky mountains if not promptly pass a delay of another year will be the consequence and may prove destructive to the white settlement in oregon

 the resolution request information in regard to the existence of civil government in new mexico and california their form and character by whom institute by what authority and how they be maintain and support
 in my message of december 22 1846 in answer to a resolution of the house of representatives call for information in relation to the establishment or organization of civil government in any portion of the territory of mexico which have or might be take possession of by the army or navy of the united states i communicate the order which have be give to the officer of our army and navy and state the general authority upon which temporary military government have be establish over the conquered portion of mexico then in our military occupation
 the temporary government authorize be institute by virtue of the right of war the power to declare war against a foreign country and to prosecute it accord to the general law of war as sanction by civilized nation it will not be question exist under our constitution when congress have declare that war exist with a foreign nation the general law of war apply to our situation and it become the duty of the president as the constitutional commander in chief of the army and navy of the united states to prosecute it
 in prosecute a foreign war thus duly declare by congress we have the right by conquest and military occupation to acquire possession of the territory of the enemy and during the war to exercise the full right of sovereignty over it the sovereignty of the enemy be in such case suspend and his law can no long be rightfully enforce over the conquered territory or be obligatory upon the inhabitant who remain and submit to the conqueror by the surrender the inhabitant pass under a temporary allegiance to the conqueror and be bind by such law and such only as he may choose to recognize and impose from the nature of the case no other law could be obligatory upon they for where there be no protection or allegiance or sovereignty there can be no claim to obedience these be well establish principle of the law of war as recognize and practice by civilized nation and they have be sanction by the high judicial tribunal of our own country
 the order and instruction issue to the officer of our army and navy applicable to such portion of the mexican territory as have be or might be conquer by our arm be in strict conformity to these principle they be indeed amelioration of the rigor of war upon which we might have insist they substitute for the harshness of military rule something of the mildness of civil government and be not only the exercise of no excess of power but be a relaxation in favor of the peaceable inhabitant of the conquer territory who have submit to our authority and be alike politic and humane
 it be from the same source of authority that we derive the unquestioned right after the war have be declare by congress to blockade the port and coast of the enemy to capture his town city and province and to levy contribution upon he for the support of our army of the same character with these be the right to subject to our temporary military government the conquer territory of our enemy they be all belligerent right and their exercise be as essential to the successful prosecution of a foreign war as the right to fight battle
 new mexico and upper california be among the territory conquer and occupy by our force and such temporary government be establish over they they be establish by the officer of our army and navy in command in pursuance of the order and instruction accompany my message to the house of representatives of december 22 1846 in their form and detail as at first establish they exceed in some respect as be state in that message the authority which have be give and instruction for the correction of the error be issue in dispatch from the war and navy departments of the 11th of january 1847 copy of which be herewith transmit they have be maintain and support out of the military exaction and contribution levy upon the enemy and no part of the expense have be pay out of the treasury of the united states
 in the routine of duty some of the officer of the army and navy who first establish temporary government in california and new mexico have be succeed in command by other officer upon whom light duty devolve and the agent employ or designate by they to conduct the temporary government have also in some instance be supersede by other such appointment for temporary civil duty during our military occupation be make by the officer in command in the conquered territory respectively
 on the conclusion and exchange of ratification of a treaty of peace with mexico which be proclaim on the 4th instant these temporary government necessarily cease to exist in the instruction to establish a temporary government over new mexico no distinction be make between that and the other provinces of mexico which might be conquer and hold in our military occupation
 the province of new mexico accord to its ancient boundary as claim by mexico lie on both side of the rio grande that part of it on the east of that river be in dispute when the war between the united states and mexico commence texas by a successful revolution in april 1836 achieve and subsequently maintain her independence by an act of the congress of texas pass in december 1836 her western boundary be declare to be the rio grande from its mouth to its source and thence due north to the forty second degree of north latitude though the republic of texas by many act of sovereignty which she assert and exercise some of which be state in my annual message of december 1846 have establish her clear title to the country west of the nueces and border upon that part of the rio grande which lie below the province of new mexico she have never conquer or reduce to actual possession and bring under her government and law that part of new mexico lie east of the rio grande which she claim to be within her limit on the breaking out of the war we find mexico in possession of this dispute territory as our army approach sante fe the capital of new mexico it be find to be hold by a governor under mexican authority with an armed force collect to resist our advance the inhabitant be mexicans acknowledge allegiance to mexico the boundary in dispute be the line between the two country engage in actual war and the settlement of it of necessity depend on a treaty of peace find the mexican authority and people in possession our force conquer they and extend military rule over they and the territory which they actually occupy in lieu of the sovereignty which be displace it be not possible to disturb or change the practical boundary line in the midst of the war when no negotiation for its adjustment could be open and when texas be not present by her constituted authority to establish and maintain government over a hostile mexican population who acknowledge no allegiance to she there be therefore no alternative leave but to establish and maintain military rule during the war over the conquered people in the dispute territory who have submit to our arm or to forbear the exercise of our belligerent right and leave they in a state of anarchy and without control
 whether the country in dispute rightfully belong to mexico or to texas it be our right in the first case and our duty as well as our right in the latter to conquer and hold it whilst this territory be in our possession as conqueror with a population hostile to the united states which more than once break out in open insurrection it be our unquestionable duty to continue our military occupation of it until the conclusion of the war and to establish over it a military government necessary for our own security as well as for the protection of the conquered people
 by the joint resolution of congress of march 1 1845 for annex texas to the united states the adjustment of all question of boundary which may arise with other government be reserve to this government when the conquest of new mexico be consummate by our arm the question of boundary remain still unadjusted until the exchange of the ratification of the late treaty new mexico never become an undisputed portion of the united states and it would therefore have be premature to deliver over to texas that portion of it on the east side of the rio grande to which she assert a claim however just the right of texas may have be to it that right have never be reduce into her possession and it be contest by mexico
 by the cession of the whole of new mexico on both side of the rio grande to the united states the question of dispute boundary so far as mexico be concern have be settle leave the question as to the true limit of texas in new mexico to be adjust between that state and the united states
 under the circumstance exist during the pendency of the war and while the whole of new mexico as claim by our enemy be in our military occupation i be not unmindful of the right of texas to that portion of it which she claim to be within her limit in answer to a letter from the governor of texas date on the 4th of january 1847 the secretary of state by my direction inform he in a letter of the 12th of february 1847 that in the president&#39;s annual message of december 1846
 you have already perceive that new mexico be at present in the temporary occupation of the troop of the united states and the government over it be military in its character it be merely such a government as must exist under the law of nation and of war to preserve order and protect the right of the inhabitant and will cease on the conclusion of a treaty of peace with mexico nothing therefore can be more certain than that this temporary government result from necessity can never injuriously affect the right which the president believe to be justly assert by texas to the whole territory on this side of the rio grande whenever the mexican claim to it shall have be extinguish by treaty but this be a subject which more properly belong to the legislative than the executive branch of the government
 the result of the whole be that texas have assert a right to that part of new mexico east of the rio grande which be believe under the act of congress for the annexation and admission of texas into the union as a state and under the constitution and law of texas to be well found but this right have never be reduce to her actual possession and occupancy the general government possess exclusively the war make power have the right to take military possession of this dispute territory and until the title to it be perfect by a treaty of peace it be their duty to hold it and to establish a temporary military government over it for the preservation of the conquest itself the safety of our army and the security of the conquered inhabitant
 the resolution far request information whether any person have be try and condemn for treason against the united states in that part of new mexico lie east of the rio grande since the same have be in the occupancy of our army and if so before what tribunal and by what authority of law such tribunal be establish it appear that after the territory in question be in the occupancy of our army some of the conquered mexican inhabitant who have at first submit to our authority break out in open insurrection murder our soldier and citizen and commit other atrocious crime some of the principal offender who be apprehend be try and condemn by a tribunal invest with civil and criminal jurisdiction which have be establish in the conquered country by the military officer in command that the offender deserve the punishment inflict upon they there be no reason to doubt and the error in the proceeding against they consist in designate and describe their crime as treason against the united states this error be point out and its recurrence thereby prevent by the secretary of war in a dispatch to the officer in command in new mexico date on the 26th of june 1847 a copy of which together with copy of all communication relate to the subject which have be receive at the war department be herewith transmit
 the resolution call for information in relation to the quantity of the public land acquire within the ceded territory and how much of the same be within the boundary of texas as define by the act of the congress of the republic of texas of the 19th day of december 1836 no mean of make an accurate estimate on the subject be in the possession of the executive department the information which be possess will be find in the accompany report of the secretary of the treasury
 the country cede to the united states lie west of the rio grande and to which texas have no title be estimate by the commissioner of the general land office to contain 526,078 square mile or 336,689,920 acre
 the period since the exchange of ratification of the treaty have be too short to enable the government to have access to or to procure abstract or copy of the land title issue by spain or by the republic of mexico step will be take to procure this information at the early practicable period it be estimate as appear from the accompanying report of the secretary of the treasury that much the large portion of the land within the territory cede remain vacant and unappropriated and will be subject to be dispose of by the united states indeed a very inconsiderable portion of the land embrace in the cession it be believe have be dispose of or grant either by spain or mexico
 what amount of money the united states may be able to realize from the sale of these vacant land must be uncertain but it be confidently believe that with prudent management after make liberal grant to emigrant and settler it will exceed the cost of the war and all the expense to which we have be subject in acquire it
 the resolution also call for the evidence or any part thereof that the 39;extensive and valuable territory cede by mexico to the united states constitute indemnity for the past "&#39
 the immense value of the ceded country do not consist alone in the amount of money for which the public land may be sell if not a dollar could be realize from the sale of these land the cession of the jurisdiction over the country and the fact that it have become a part of our union and can not be make subject to any european power constitute ample indemnity for the past in the immense value and advantage which its acquisition must give to the commercial navigating manufacturing and agricultural interest of our country
 the value of the public land embrace within the limit of the ceded territory great as that value may be be far less important to the people of the united states than the sovereignty over the country most of our state contain no public land own by the united states and yet the sovereignty and jurisdiction over they be of incalculable importance to the nation in the state of new york the united states be the owner of no public land and yet two third of our whole revenue be collect at the great port of that state and within her limit be find about one seventh of our entire population although none of the future city on our coast of california may ever rival the city of new york in wealth population and business yet that important city will grow up on the magnificent harbor of that coast with a rapidly increase commerce and population and yield a large revenue would seem to be certain by the possession of the safe and capacious harbor on the californian coast we shall have great advantage in secure the rich commerce of the east and shall thus obtain for our product new and increased market and greatly enlarge our coasting and foreign trade as well as augment our tonnage and revenue
 these great advantage far more than the simple value of the public land in the ceded territory constitute our indemnity for the past

i communicate herewith a report from the secretary of war contain the information call for by the resolution of the house of representatives of the 17th july 1848 in relation to the number of indians in oregon california and new mexico the number of military post the number of troop which will be require in each and the whole military force which should constitute the peace establishment
 i have see no reason to change the opinion express in my message to congress of the 6th july 1848 transmit the treaty of peace with mexico that the old army as it exist before the commencement of the war with mexico especially if authority be give to fill up the rank and file of the several corp to the maximum number authorize during the war will be a sufficient force to be retain in service during a period of peace
 the old army consist of fifteen regiment by the act of the 13th of may 1846 the president be authorize by voluntary enlistment to increase the number of private in each or any of the company of the exist regiment of dragoon artillery and infantry to any number not exceed 100 and to reduce the same to 64 when the exigency require the present increase shall cease should this act remain in force the maximum number of the rank and file of the army authorize by it would be over 16,000 man exclusive of officer should the authority confer by this act be continue it would depend on the exigency of the service whether the number of the rank and file should be increase and if so to what amount beyond the minimum number of 64 private to a company
 allow 64 private to a company the army would be over 10,000 man exclusive of commissioned and noncommissioned officer a number which it be believe will be sufficient but as a precautionary measure it be deem expedient that the executive should possess the power of increase the strength of the respective corp should the exigency of the service be such as to require it should these exigency not call for such increase the discretionary power give by the act to the president will not be exercise
 it will be see from the report of the secretary of war that a portion of the force will be employ in oregon new mexico and upper california a portion for the protection of the texas frontier adjoining the mexican possession and border on the territory occupy by the indian tribe within her limit after detail the force necessary for these object it be believe a sufficient number of troop will remain to afford security and protection to our indian frontier in the west and northwest and to occupy with sufficient garrison the post on our northern and atlantic border
 i have no reason at present to believe that any increase of the number of regiment or corp will he require during a period of peace

to the house of representatives of the united states
 when the president have give his official sanction to a bill which have pass congress usage require that he shall notify the house in which it originate of that fact the mode of give this notification have be by an oral message deliver by his private secretary
 have this day approve and sign an act entitle an act to establish the territorial government of oregon i deem it proper under the exist circumstance to communicate the fact in a more solemn form the deeply interesting and protract discussion which have take place in both houses of congress and the absorbing interest which the subject have excite throughout the country justify in my judgment this departure from the form of notice observe in other case in this communication with a coordinate branch of the government make proper by the consideration refer to i shall frankly and without reserve express the reason which have constrain i not to withhold my signature from the bill to establish a government over oregon even though the two territory of new mexico and california be to be leave for the present without government none doubt that it be proper to establish a government in oregon indeed it have be too long delay i have make repeat recommendation to congress to this effect the petition of the people of that distant region have be present to the government and ought not to be disregard to give to they a regularly organize government and the protection of our law which as citizen of the united states they claim be a high duty on our part and one which we be bind to perform unless there be control reason to prevent it
 in the progress of all government question of such transcendent importance occasionally arise as to cast in the shade all those of a mere party character but one such question can now be agitate in this country and this may endanger our glorious union the source of our greatness and all our political blessing this question be slavery with the slaveholde states this do not embrace merely the right of property however valuable but it ascend far high and involve the domestic peace and security of every family
 the father of the constitution the wise and patriotic man who lay the foundation of our institution foresee the danger from this quarter act in a spirit of compromise and mutual concession on this dangerous and delicate subject and their wisdom ought to be the guide of their successor whilst they leave to the states exclusively the question of domestic slavery within their respective limit they provide that slave who might escape into other states not recognize the institution of slavery shall be deliver up on the claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due
 upon this foundation the matter rest until the missouri question arise
 in december 1819 application be make to congress by the people of the missouri territory for admission into the union as a state the discussion upon the subject in congress involve the question of slavery and be prosecute with such violence as to produce excitement alarming to every patriot in the union but the good genius of conciliation which preside at the birth of our institution finally prevail and the missouri compromise be adopt the eighth section of the act of congress of the 6th of march 1820 to authorize the people of the missouri territory to form a constitution and state government etc provide
 that in all that territory cede by france to the united states under the name of louisiana which lie north of 36 degree 30&#39 north latitude not include within the limit of the state contemplate by this act slavery and involuntary servitude otherwise than in the punishment of crime whereof the party shall have be duly convict shall be and be hereby forever prohibit provide always that any person escape into the same from whom labor or service be lawfully claim in any state or territory of the united states such fugitive may be lawfully reclaim and convey to the person claim his or her labor or service as aforesaid
 this compromise have the effect of calm the troubled wave and restore peace and good will throughout the states of the union
 the missouri question have excite intense agitation of the public mind and threaten to divide the country into geographical party alienate the feeling of attachment which each portion of our union should bear to every other the compromise allay the excitement tranquilize the popular mind and restore confidence and fraternal feeling its author be hail as public benefactor
 i do not doubt that a similar adjustment of the question which now agitate the public mind would produce the same happy result if the legislation of congress on the subject of the other territories shall not be adopt in a spirit of conciliation and compromise it be impossible that the country can be satisfied or that the most disastrous consequence shall fail to ensue
 when texas be admit into the union the same spirit of compromise which guide our predecessor in the admission of missouri a quarter of a century before prevail without any serious opposition the joint resolution for annex texas to the united states approve march 1 1845 provide that--
 such states as may be form out of that portion of say territory lie south of 36&deg 30&#39 north latitude commonly know as the missouri compromise line shall be admit into the union with or without slavery as the people of each state ask admission may desire and in such state or states as shall be form out of say territory north of the missouri compromise line slavery or involuntary servitude except for crime shall be prohibit
 the territory of oregon lie far north of 36&deg 30&#39 the missouri and texas compromise line its southern boundary be the parallel of 42&deg leave the intermediate distance to be 330 geographical mile and it be because the provision of this bill be not inconsistent with the law of the missouri compromise if extend from the rio grande to the pacific ocean that i have not feel at liberty to withhold my sanction have it embrace territory south of that compromise the question present for my consideration would have be of a far different character and my action upon it must have correspond with my conviction
 ought we now to disturb the missouri and texas compromise ought we at this late day in attempt to annul what have be so long establish and acquiesce in to excite sectional division and jealousy to alienate the people of different portion of the union from each other and to endanger the existence of the union itself
 from the adoption of the federal constitution during a period of sixty year our progress as a nation have be without example in the annal of history under the protection of a bountiful providence we have advance with giant stride in the career of wealth and prosperity we have enjoy the blessing of freedom to a great extent than any other people ancient or modern under a government which have preserve order and secure to every citizen life liberty and property we have now become an example for imitation to the whole world the friend of freedom in every clime point with admiration to our institution shall we then at the moment when the people of europe be devote all their energy in the attempt to assimilate their institution to our own peril all our blessing by despise the lesson of experience and refuse to tread in the footstep which our father have tread and for what cause would we endanger our glorious union the missouri compromise contain a prohibition of slavery throughout all that vast region extend twelve and a half degree along the pacific from the parallel of 36&deg 30&#39 to that of 49&deg and east from that ocean to and beyond the summit of the rocky mountains why then should our institution be endanger because it be propose to submit to the people of the remainder of our newly acquire territory lie south of 36&deg 30&#39 embrace less than four degree of latitude the question whether in the language of the texas compromise they shall be admit as a state into the union with or without slavery be this a question to be push to such extremity by excited partisan on the one side or the other in regard to our newly acquire distant possession on the pacific as to endanger the union of thirty glorious states which constitute our confederacy i have an abide confidence that the sober reflection and sound patriotism of the people of all the states will bring they to the conclusion that the dictate of wisdom be to follow the example of those who have go before we and settle this dangerous question on the missouri compromise or some other equitable compromise which would respect the right of all and prove satisfactory to the different portion of the union
 hold as a sacred trust the executive authority for the whole union and bind to guard the right of all i should be constrain by a sense of duty to withhold my official sanction from any measure which would conflict with these important object
 i can not more appropriately close this message than by quote from the farewell address of the father of his country his warning voice can never be hear in vain by the american people if the spirit of prophecy have distinctly present to his view more than a half century ago the present distract condition of his country the language which he then employ could not have be more appropriate than it be to the present occasion he declare
 the unity of government which constitute you one people be also now dear to you it be justly so for it be a main pillar in the edifice of your real independence the support of your tranquillity at home your peace abroad of your safety of your prosperity of that very liberty which you so highly prize but as it be easy to foresee that from different cause and from different quarter much pain will be take many artifice employ to weaken in your mind the conviction of this truth as this be the point in your political fortress against which the battery of internal and external enemy will be most constantly and actively though often covertly and insidiously direct it be of infinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of your national union to your collective and individual happiness that you should cherish a cordial habitual and immovable attachment to it accustom yourself to think and speak of it as of the palladium of your political safety and prosperity watch for its preservation with jealous anxiety discountenance whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandon and indignantly frown upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred tie which now link together the various part
 for this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest citizen by birth or choice of a common country that country have a right to concentrate your affection the name of american which belong to you in your national capacity must always exalt the just pride of patriotism more than any appellation derive from local discrimination with slight shade of difference you have the same religion manner habit and political principle you have in a common cause fight and triumph together the independence and liberty you possess be the work of joint council and joint effort of common danger suffering and success
 with such powerful and obvious motive to union affect all part of our country while experience shall not have demonstrate its impracticability there will always be reason to distrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to weaken its hand
 in contemplate the cause which may disturb our union it occur as matter of serious concern that any ground should have be furnish for characterize party by geographical discriminations-- northern and southern atlantic and western --whence design man may endeavor to excite a belief that there be a real difference of local interest and view one of the expedient of party to acquire influence within particular district be to misrepresent the opinion and aim of other district you can not shield yourselves too much against the jealousy and heartburning which spring from these misrepresentation they tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bind together by fraternal affection

 one of the most important result of the war into which we be recently force with a neighboring nation be the demonstration it have afford of the military strength of our country before the late war with mexico european and other foreign power entertain imperfect and erroneous view of our physical strength as a nation and of our ability to prosecute war and especially a war wage out of out own country they see that our stand army on the peace establishment do not exceed 10,000 man accustomed themselves to maintain in peace large stand army for the protection of throne against their own subject as well as against foreign enemy they have not conceive that it be possible for a nation without such an army well disciplined and of long service to wage war successfully they hold in low repute our militia and be far from regard they as an effective force unless it might be for temporary defensive operation when invade on our own soil the event of the late war with mexico have not only undeceived they but have remove erroneous impression which prevail to some extent even among a portion of our own countryman that war have demonstrate that upon the breaking out of hostility not anticipate and for which no previous preparation have be make a volunteer army of citizen soldier equal to veteran troop and in number equal to any emergency can in a short period be bring into the field unlike what would have occur in any other country we be under no necessity of resort to draft or conscription on the contrary such be the number of volunteer who patriotically tender their service that the chief difficulty be in make selection and determine who should be disappoint and compel to remain at home our citizen soldier be unlike those draw from the population of any other country they be compose indiscriminately of all profession and pursuit of farmer lawyer physician merchant manufacturer mechanic and laborer and this not only among the officer but the private soldier in the rank our citizen soldier be unlike those of any other country in other respect they be arm and have be accustom from their youth up to handle and use firearm and a large proportion of they especially in the western and more newly settle states be expert marksman they be man who have a reputation to maintain at home by their good conduct in the field they be intelligent and there be an individuality of character which be find in the rank of no other army in battle each private man as well as every officer right not only for his country but for glory and distinction among his fellow citizen when he shall return to civil life
 the war with mexico have demonstrate not only the ability of the government to organize a numerous army upon a sudden call but also to provide it with all the munition and necessary supply with dispatch convenience and ease and to direct its operation with efficiency the strength of our institution have not only be display in the valor and skill of our troop engage in active service in the field but in the organization of those executive branch which be charge with the general direction and conduct of the war while too great praise can not be bestow upon the officer and man who fight our battle it would be unjust to withhold from those officer necessarily station at home who be charge with the duty of furnish the army in proper time and at proper place with all the munition of war and other supply so necessary to make it efficient the commendation to which they be entitle the credit due to this class of our officer be the great when it be consider that no army in ancient or modern time be even well appoint or provide than our army in mexico operate in an enemy&#39;s country remove 2,000 mile from the seat of the federal government its different corp spread over a vast extent of territory hundred and even thousand of mile apart from each other nothing short of the untiring vigilance and extraordinary energy of these officer could have enable they to provide the army at all point and in proper season with all that be require for the most efficient service
 it be but an act of justice to declare that the officer in charge of the several executive bureau all under the immediate eye and supervision of the secretary of war perform their respective duty with ability energy and efficiency they have reap less of the glory of the war not having be personally expose to its peril in battle than their companion in arm but without their forecast efficient aid and cooperation those in the field would not have be provide with the ample mean they possess of achieve for themselves and their country the unfading honor which they have win for both
 when all these fact be consider it may cease to be a matter of so much amazement abroad how it happen that our noble army in mexico regular and volunteer be victorious upon every battlefield however fearful the odd against they
 the war with mexico have thus fully develop the capacity of republican government to prosecute successfully a just and necessary foreign war with all the vigor usually attribute to more arbitrary form of government it have be usual for writer on public law to impute to republic a want of that unity concentration of purpose and vigor of execution which be generally admit to belong to the monarchical and aristocratic form and this feature of popular government have be suppose to display itself more particularly in the conduct of a war carry on in an enemy&#39;s territory the war with great britain in 1812 be to a great extent confine within our own limit and shed but little light on this subject but the war which we have just close by an honorable peace evince beyond all doubt that a popular representative government be equal to any emergency which be likely to arise in the affair of a nation
 the war with mexico have develop most strikingly and conspicuously another feature in our institution it be that without cost to the government or danger to our liberty we have in the bosom of our society of freeman available in a just and necessary war virtually a stand army of 2,000,000 armed citizen soldier such as fight the battle of mexico but our military strength do not consist alone in our capacity for extended and successful operation on land the navy be an important arm of the national defense if the service of the navy be not so brilliant as those of the army in the late war with mexico it be because they have no enemy to meet on their own element while the army have opportunity of perform more conspicuous service the navy largely participate in the conduct of the war both branch of the service perform their whole duty to the country for the able and gallant service of the officer and man of the navy act independently as well as in cooperation with our troop in the conquest of the californias the capture of vera cruz and the seizure and occupation of other important position on the gulf and pacific coast the high praise be due their vigilance energy and skill render the most effective service in exclude munition of war and other supply from the enemy while they secure a safe entrance for abundant supply for our own army our extended commerce be nowhere interrupted and for this immunity from the evil of war the country be indebted to the navy
 high praise be due to the officer of the several executive bureau navy yard and station connect with the service all under the immediate direction of the secretary of the navy for the industry foresight and energy with which everything be direct and furnish to give efficiency to that branch of the service the same vigilance exist in direct the operation of the navy as of the army there be concert of action and of purpose between the head of the two arm of the service by the order which be from time to time issue our vessel of war on the pacific and the gulf of mexico be station in proper time and in proper position to cooperate efficiently with the army by this mean their combine power be bring to bear successfully on the enemy
 the great result which have be develop and bring to light by this war will be of immeasurable importance in the future progress of our country they will tend powerfully to preserve we from foreign collision and to enable we to pursue uninterruptedly our cherished policy of peace with all nation entangle alliance with none
 occupying as we do a more commanding position among nation than at any former period our duty and our responsibility to ourselves and to posterity be correspondingly increase this will be the more obvious when we consider the vast addition which have be recently make to our territorial possession and their great importance and value
 within less than four year the annexation of texas to the union have be consummate all conflict title to the oregon territory south of the forty ninth degree of north latitude be all that be insist on by any of my predecessor have be adjust and new mexico and upper california have be acquire by treaty the area of these several territories accord to a report carefully prepare by the commissioner of the general land office from the most authentic information in his possession and which be herewith transmit contain 1,193,061 square mile or 763,559,040 acre while the area of the remain twenty nine states and the territory not yet organize into states east of the rocky mountains contain 2,059,513 square mile or 1,318,126,058 acre these estimate show that the territory recently acquire and over which our exclusive jurisdiction and dominion have be extend constitute a country more than half as large as all that which be hold by the united states before their acquisition if oregon be exclude from the estimate there will still remain within the limit of texas new mexico and california 851,598 square mile or 545,012,720 acre be an addition equal to more than one third of all the territory own by the united states before their acquisition and include oregon nearly as great an extent of territory as the whole of europe russia only except the mississippi so lately the frontier of our country be now only its center with the addition of the late acquisition the united states be now estimate to be nearly as large as the whole of europe it be estimate by the superintendent of the coast survey in the accompanying report that the extent of the seacoast of texas on the gulf of mexico be upward of 400 mile of the coast of upper california on the pacific of 970 mile and of oregon include the straits of fuca of 650 mile make the whole extent of seacoast on the pacific 1,620 mile and the whole extent on both the pacific and the gulf of mexico 2,020 mile the length of the coast on the atlantic from the northern limit of the united states around the cape of florida to the sabine on the eastern boundary of texas be estimate to be 3,100 mile so that the addition of seacoast include oregon be very nearly two third as great as all we possess before and exclude oregon be an addition of 1,370 mile be nearly equal to one half of the extent of coast which we possess before these acquisition we have now three great maritime front on the atlantic the gulf of mexico and the pacific make in the whole an extent of seacoast exceed 5,000 mile this be the extent of the seacoast of the united states not include bay sound and small irregularity of the main shore and of the sea island if these be include the length of the shore line of coast as estimate by the superintendent of the coast survey in his report would be 33,063 mile
 it would be difficult to calculate the value of these immense addition to our territorial possession texas lie contiguous to the western boundary of louisiana embrace within its limit a part of the navigable tributary water of the mississippi and an extensive seacoast could not long have remain in the hand of a foreign power without endanger the peace of our southwestern frontier her product in the vicinity of the tributary of the mississippi must have seek a market through these stream run into and through our territory and the danger of irritation and collision of interest between texas as a foreign state and ourselves would have be imminent while the embarrassment in the commercial intercourse between they must have be constant and unavoidable have texas fall into the hand or under the influence and control of a strong maritime or military foreign power as she might have do these danger would have be still great they have be avoid by her voluntary and peaceful annexation to the united states texas from her position be a natural and almost indispensable part of our territory fortunately she have be restore to our country and now constitute one of the states of our confederacy upon an equal footing with the original state the salubrity of climate the fertility of soil peculiarly adapt to the production of some of our most valuable staple commodity and her commercial advantage must soon make her one of our most populous states
 new mexico though situate in the interior and without a seacoast be know to contain much fertile land to abound in rich mine of the precious metal and to be capable of sustain a large population from its position it be the intermediate and connect territory between our settlement and our possession in texas and those on the pacific coast
 upper california irrespective of the vast mineral wealth recently develop there hold at this day in point of value and importance to the rest of the union the same relation that louisiana do when that fine territory be acquire from france forty five year ago extend nearly ten degree of latitude along the pacific and embrace the only safe and commodious harbor on that coast for many hundred mile with a temperate climate and an extensive interior of fertile land it be scarcely possible to estimate its wealth until it shall be bring under the government of our law and its resource fully develop from its position it must command the rich commerce of china of asia of the island of the pacific of western mexico of central america the south american states and of the russian possession border on that ocean a great emporium will doubtless speedily arise on the californian coast which may be destine to rival in importance new orleans itself the depot of the vast commerce which must exist on the pacific will probably be at some point on the bay of san francisco and will occupy the same relation to the whole western coast of that ocean as new orleans do to the valley of the mississippi and the gulf of mexico to this depot our numerous whale ship will resort with their cargo to trade refit and obtain supply this of itself will largely contribute to build up a city which would soon become the center of a great and rapidly increase commerce situate on a safe harbor sufficiently capacious for all the navy as well as the marine of the world and convenient to excellent timber for shipbuilding own by the united states it must become our great western naval depot
 it be know that mine of the precious metal exist to a considerable extent in california at the time of its acquisition recent discovery render it probable that these mine be more extensive and valuable than be anticipate the account of the abundance of gold in that territory be of such an extraordinary character as would scarcely command belief be they not corroborate by the authentic report of officer in the public service who have visit the mineral district and derive the fact which they detail from personal observation reluctant to credit the report in general circulation as to the quantity of gold the officer command our force in california visit the mineral district in july last for the purpose of obtain accurate information on the subject his report to the war department of the result of his examination and the fact obtain on the spot be herewith lay before congress when he visit the country there be about 4,000 person engage in collect gold there be every reason to believe that the number of person so employ have since be augment the exploration already make warrant the belief that the supply be very large and that gold be find at various place in an extensive district of country
 information receive from officer of the navy and other source though not so full and minute confirm the account of the commander of our military force in california it appear also from these report that mine of quicksilver be find in the vicinity of the gold region one of they be now be work and be believe to be among the most productive in the world
 the effect produce by the discovery of these rich mineral deposit and the success which have attend the labor of those who have resort to they have produce a surprising change in the state of affair in california labor command a most exorbitant price and all other pursuit but that of search for the precious metal be abandon nearly the whole of the male population of the country have go to the gold district ship arrive on the coast be desert by their crew and their voyage suspend for want of sailor our commanding officer there entertain apprehension that soldier can not be keep in the public service without a large increase of pay desertion in his command have become frequent and he recommend that those who shall withstand the strong temptation and remain faithful should be reward
 this abundance of gold and the all engross pursuit of it have already cause in california an unprecedented rise in the price of all the necessary of life
 that we may the more speedily and fully avail ourselves of the undeveloped wealth of these mine it be deem of vast importance that a branch of the mint of the united states be authorize to be establish at your present session in california among other signal advantage which would result from such an establishment would be that of raise the gold to its par value in that territory a branch mint of the united states at the great commercial depot on the west coast would convert into our own coin not only the gold derive from our own rich mine but also the bullion and specie which our commerce may bring from the whole west coast of central and south america the west coast of america and the adjacent interior embrace the rich and good mine of mexico new granada central america chili and peru the bullion and specie draw from these country and especially from those of western mexico and peru to an amount in value of many million of dollar be now annually divert and carry by the ship of great britain to her own port to be recoine or use to sustain her national bank and thus contribute to increase her ability to command so much of the commerce of the world if a branch mint be establish at the great commercial point upon that coast a vast amount of bullion and specie would flow thither to be recoine and pass thence to new orleans new york and other atlantic city the amount of our constitutional currency at home would be greatly increase while its circulation abroad would be promote it be well known to our merchant trade to china and the west coast of america that great inconvenience and loss be experience from the fact that our coin be not current at their par value in those country
 the power of europe far remove from the west coast of america by the atlantic ocean which intervene and by a tedious and dangerous navigation around the southern cape of the continent of america can never successfully compete with the united states in the rich and extensive commerce which be open to we at so much less cost by the acquisition of california
 the vast importance and commercial advantage of california have heretofore remain undeveloped by the government of the country of which it constitute a part now that this fine province be a part of our country all the states of the union some more immediately and directly than other be deeply interested in the speedy development of its wealth and resource no section of our country be more interested or will be more benefited than the commercial navigating and manufacturing interest of the eastern states our planting and farming interest in every part of the union will be greatly benefit by it as our commerce and navigation be enlarge and extend our export of agricultural product and of manufacture will be increase and in the new market thus open they can not fail to command remunerate and profitable price
 the acquisition of california and new mexico the settlement of the oregon boundary and the annexation of texas extend to the rio grande be result which combine be of great consequence and will add more to the strength and wealth of the nation than any which have precede they since the adoption of the constitution
 but to effect these great result not only california but new mexico must be bring under the control of regularly organize government the exist condition of california and of that part of new mexico lie west of the rio grande and without the limit of texas imperiously demand that congress should at its present session organize territorial government over they
 upon the exchange of ratification of the treaty of peace with mexico on the 30th of may last the temporary government which have be establish over new mexico and california by our military and naval commander by virtue of the right of war cease to derive any obligatory force from that source of authority and having be cede to the united states all government and control over they under the authority of mexico have cease to exist impress with the necessity of establish territorial government over they i recommend the subject to the favorable consideration of congress in my message communicate the ratified treaty of peace on the 6th of july last and invoke their action at that session congress adjourn without make any provision for their government the inhabitant by the transfer of their country have become entitled to the benefit of our law and constitution and yet be leave without any regularly organize government since that time the very limited power possess by the executive have be exercise to preserve and protect they from the inevitable consequence of a state of anarchy the only government which remain be that establish by the military authority during the war regard this to be a de facto government and that by the presume consent of the inhabitant it might be continue temporarily they be advise to conform and submit to it for the short intervening period before congress would again assemble and could legislate on the subject the view entertain by the executive on this point be contain in a communication of the secretary of state date the 7th of october last which be forward for publication to california and new mexico a copy of which be herewith transmit the small military force of the regular army which be serve within the limit of the acquire territory at the close of the war be retain in they and additional force have be order there for the protection of the inhabitant and to preserve and secure the right and interest of the united states
 no revenue have be or could be collect at the port in california because congress fail to authorize the establishment of custom house or the appointment of officer for that purpose
 the secretary of the treasury by a circular letter address to collector of the custom on the 7th day of october last a copy of which be herewith transmit exercise all the power with which he be invest by law
 in pursuance of the act of the 14th of august last extend the benefit of our post office law to the people of california the postmaster general have appoint two agent who have proceed the one to california and the other to oregon with authority to make the necessary arrangement for carry its provision into effect
 the monthly line of mail steamer from panama to astoria have be require to stop and deliver and take mail at san diego monterey and san francisco these mail steamer connect by the isthmus of panama with the line of mail steamer on the atlantic between new york and chagres will establish a regular mail communication with california
 it be our solemn duty to provide with the least practicable delay for new mexico and california regularly organize territorial government the cause of the failure to do this at the last session of congress be well known and deeply to be regret with the opening prospect of increase prosperity and national greatness which the acquisition of these rich and extensive territorial possession afford how irrational it would be to forego or to reject these advantage by the agitation of a domestic question which be coeval with the existence of our government itself and to endanger by internal strife geographical division and heated contest for political power or for any other cause the harmony of the glorious union of our confederated states that union which bind we together as one people and which for sixty year have be our shield and protection against every danger in the eye of the world and of posterity how trivial and insignificant will be all our internal division and struggle compare with the preservation of this union of the states in all its vigor and with all its countless blessing no patriot would foment and excite geographical and sectional division no lover of his country would deliberately calculate the value of the union future generation would look in amazement upon the folly of such a course other nation at the present day would look upon it with astonishment and such of they as desire to maintain and perpetuate throne and monarchical or aristocratical principle will view it with exultation and delight because in it they will see the element of faction which they hope must ultimately overturn our system ours be the great example of a prosperous and free self govern republic command the admiration and the imitation of all the lover of freedom throughout the world how solemn therefore be the duty how impressive the call upon we and upon all part of our country to cultivate a patriotic spirit of harmony of good fellowship of compromise and mutual concession in the administration of the incomparable system of government form by our father in the midst of almost insuperable difficulty and transmit to we with the injunction that we should enjoy its blessing and hand it down unimpaired to those who may come after we
 in view of the high and responsible duty which we owe to ourselves and to mankind i trust you may be able at your present session to approach the adjustment of the only domestic question which seriously threaten or probably ever can threaten to disturb the harmony and successful operation of our system
 the immensely valuable possession of new mexico and california be already inhabit by a considerable population attract by their great fertility their mineral wealth their commercial advantage and the salubrity of the climate emigrant from the old states in great number be already prepare to seek new home in these invite region shall the dissimilarity of the domestic institution in the different states prevent we from provide for they suitable government these institution exist at the adoption of the constitution but the obstacle which they interpose be overcome by that spirit of compromise which be now invoke in a conflict of opinion or of interest real or imaginary between different section of our country neither can justly demand all which it might desire to obtain each in the true spirit of our institution should concede something to the other
 our gallant force in the mexican war by whose patriotism and unparalleled deed of arm we obtain these possession as an indemnity for our just demand against mexico be compose of citizen who belong to no one state or section of our union they be man from slaveholde and nonslaveholde states from the north and the south from the east and the west they be all companion in arm and fellow citizen of the same common country engage in the same common cause when prosecute that war they be brother and friend and share alike with each other common toil danger and suffering now when their work be end when peace be restore and they return again to their home put off the habiliment of war take their place in society and resume their pursuit in civil life surely a spirit of harmony and concession and of equal regard for the right of all and of all section of the union ought to prevail in provide government for the acquire territory the fruit of their common service the whole people of the united states and of every state contribute to defray the expense of that war and it would not be just for any one section to exclude another from all participation in the acquire territory this would not be in consonance with the just system of government which the framer of the constitution adopt
 the question be believe to be rather abstract than practical whether slavery ever can or would exist in any portion of the acquire territory even if it be leave to the option of the slaveholde states themselves from the nature of the climate and production in much the large portion of it it be certain it could never exist and in the remainder the probability be it would not but however this may be the question involve as it do a principle of equality of right of the separate and several states as equal copartner in the confederacy should not be disregard
 in organize government over these territory no duty impose on congress by the constitution require that they should legislate on the subject of slavery while their power to do so be not only seriously question but deny by many of the sound expounder of that instrument whether congress shall legislate or not the people of the acquire territory when assemble in convention to form state constitution will possess the sole and exclusive power to determine for themselves whether slavery shall or shall not exist within their limit if congress shall abstain from interfere with the question the people of these territory will be leave free to adjust it as they may think proper when they apply for admission as states into the union no enactment of congress could restrain the people of any of the sovereign states of the union old or new north or south slaveholde or nonslaveholde from determine the character of their own domestic institution as they may deem wise and proper any and all the states possess this right and congress can not deprive they of it the people of georgia might if they choose so alter their constitution as to abolish slavery within its limit and the people of vermont might so alter their constitution as to admit slavery within its limit both states would possess the right though as all know it be not probable that either would exert it
 it be fortunate for the peace and harmony of the union that this question be in its nature temporary and can only continue for the brief period which will intervene before california and new mexico may be admit as states into the union from the tide of population now flow into they it be highly probable that this will soon occur
 consider the several states and the citizen of the several states as equal and entitle to equal right under the constitution if this be an original question it might well be insist on that the principle of noninterference be the true doctrine and that congress could not in the absence of any express grant of power interfere with their relative right upon a great emergency however and under menacing danger to the union the missouri compromise line in respect to slavery be adopt the same line be extend far west in the acquisition of texas after an acquiescence of nearly thirty year in the principle of compromise recognize and establish by these act and to avoid the danger to the union which might follow if it be now disregarded i have heretofore express the opinion that that line of compromise should be extend on the parallel of 36&deg 30&#39 from the western boundary of texas where it now terminate to the pacific ocean this be the middle ground of compromise upon which the different section of the union may meet as they have heretofore meet if this be do it be confidently believe a large majority of the people of every section of the country however widely their abstract opinion on the subject of slavery may differ would cheerfully and patriotically acquiesce in it and peace and harmony would again fill our border
 the restriction north of the line be only yield to in the case of missouri and texas upon a principle of compromise make necessary for the sake of preserve the harmony and possibly the existence of the union
 it be upon these consideration that at the close of your last session i give my sanction to the principle of the missouri compromise line by approve and sign the bill to establish the territorial government of oregon from a sincere desire to preserve the harmony of the union and in deference for the act of my predecessor i feel constrain to yield my acquiescence to the extent to which they have go in compromise this delicate and dangerous question but if congress shall now reverse the decision by which the missouri compromise be effect and shall propose to extend the restriction over the whole territory south as well as north of the parallel of 36&deg 30&#39 it will cease to be a compromise and must be regard as an original question
 if congress instead of observe the course of noninterference leave the adoption of their own domestic institution to the people who may inhabit these territory or if instead of extend the missouri compromise line to the pacific shall prefer to submit the legal and constitutional question which may arise to the decision of the judicial tribunal as be propose in a bill which pass the senate at your last session an adjustment may be effect in this mode if the whole subject be refer to the judiciary all part of the union should cheerfully acquiesce in the final decision of the tribunal create by the constitution for the settlement of all question which may arise under the constitution treaty and law of the united states
 congress be earnestly invoke for the sake of the union its harmony and our continued prosperity as a nation to adjust at its present session this the only dangerous question which lie in our path if not in some one of the mode suggest in some other which may be satisfactory
 in anticipation of the establishment of regular government over the acquire territory a joint commission of officer of the army and navy have be order to proceed to the coast of california and oregon for the purpose of make reconnaissance and a report as to the proper site for the erection of fortification or other defensive work on land and of suitable situation for naval station the information which may be expect from a scientific and skillful examination of the whole face of the coast will be eminently useful to congress when they come to consider the propriety of make appropriation for these great national object proper defense on land will be necessary for the security and protection of our possession and the establishment of navy yard and a dock for the repair and construction of vessel will be important alike to our navy and commercial marine without such establishment every vessel whether of the navy or of the merchant service require repair must at great expense come round cape horn to one of our atlantic yard for that purpose with such establishment vessel it be believe may be build or repair as cheaply in california as upon the atlantic coast they would give employment to many of our enterprise shipbuilder and mechanic and greatly facilitate and enlarge our commerce in the pacific
 as it be ascertain that mine of gold silver copper and quicksilver exist in new mexico and california and that nearly all the land where they be find belong to the united states it be deem important to the public interest that provision be make for a geological and mineralogical examination of these region measure should be adopt to preserve the mineral land especially such as contain the precious metal for the use of the united states or if bring into market to separate they from the farming land and dispose of they in such manner as to secure a large return of money to the treasury and at the same time to lead to the development of their wealth by individual proprietor and purchaser to do this it will be necessary to provide for an immediate survey and location of the lot if congress should deem it proper to dispose of the mineral land they should be sell in small quantity and at a fix minimum price
 i recommend that surveyor general&#39;s office be authorize to be establish in new mexico and california and provision make for survey and bring the public land into market at the early practicable period in dispose of these land i recommend that the right of preemption be secure and liberal grant make to the early emigrant who have settle or may settle upon they
 it will be important to extend our revenue law over these territory and especially over california at an early period there be already a considerable commerce with california and until port of entry shall be establish and collector appoint no revenue can be receive
 if these and other necessary and proper measure be adopt for the development of the wealth and resource of new mexico and california and regular territorial government be establish over they such will probably be the rapid enlargement of our commerce and navigation and such the addition to the national wealth that the present generation may live to witness the control commercial and monetary power of the world transfer from london and other european emporium to the city of new york
 the apprehension which be entertain by some of our statesman in the early period of the government that our system be incapable of operate with sufficient energy and success over largely extend territorial limit and that if this be attempt it would fall to piece by its own weakness have be dissipate by our experience by the division of power between the states and federal government the latter be find to operate with as much energy in the extreme as in the center it be as efficient in the remotest of the thirty states which now compose the union as it be in the thirteen state which form our constitution indeed it may well be doubt whether if our present population have be confine within the limit of the original thirteen state the tendency to centralization and consolidation would not have be such as to have encroach upon the essential reserve right of the states and thus to have make the federal government a widely different one practically from what it be in theory and be intend to be by its framer so far from entertaining apprehension of the safety of our system by the extension of our territory the belief be confidently entertain that each new state give strength and an additional guaranty for the preservation of the union itself
 in pursuance of the provision of the thirteenth article of the treaty of peace friendship limit and settlement with the republic of mexico and of the act of july 29 1848 claim of our citizen which have be already liquidate and decide against the mexican republic amounting with the interest thereon to $ 2,023,832.51 have be liquidate and pay there remain to be pay of these claim $ 74,192.26
 congress at its last session having make no provision for execute the fifteenth article of the treaty by which the united states assume to make satisfaction for the unliquidated claim of our citizen against mexico to an amount not exceed three and a quarter million of dollar the subject be again recommend to your favorable consideration
 the exchange of ratification of the treaty with mexico take place on the 30th of may 1848 within one year after that time the commissioner and surveyor which each government stipulate to appoint be require to meet at the port of san diego and proceed to run and mark the say boundary in its whole course to the mouth of the rio bravo del norte it will be see from this provision that the period within which a commissioner and surveyor of the respective government be to meet at san diego will expire on the 30th of may 1849 congress at the close of its last session make an appropriation for the expense of run and mark the boundary line between the two country but do not fix the amount of salary which should be pay to the commissioner and surveyor to be appoint on the part of the united states it be desirable that the amount of compensation which they shall receive should be prescribe by law and not leave as at present to executive discretion
 measure be adopt at the early practicable period to organize the territorial government of oregon as authorize by the act of the 14th of august last the governor and marshal of the territory accompany by a small military escort leave the frontier of missouri in september last and take the southern route by the way of santa fe and the river gila to california with the intention of proceed thence in one of our vessel of war to their destination the governor be fully advise of the great importance of his early arrival in the country and it be confidently believe he may reach oregon in the latter part of the present month or early in the next the other officer for the territory have proceed by sea
 in the month of may last i communicate information to congress that an indian war have break out in oregon and recommend that authority be give to raise an adequate number of volunteer to proceed without delay to the assistance of our fellow citizen in that territory the authority to raise such a force not having be grant by congress as soon as their service could be dispense with in mexico order be issue to the regiment of mount rifleman to proceed to jefferson barracks in missouri and to prepare to march to oregon as soon as the necessary provision could be make shortly before it be ready to march it be arrest by the provision of the act pass by congress on the last day of the last session which direct that all the noncommissioned officer musician and private of that regiment who have be in service in mexico should upon their application be entitle to be discharge the effect of this provision be to disband the rank and file of the regiment and before their place could be fill by recruit the season have so far advanced that it be impracticable for it to proceed until the opening of the next spring
 in the month of october last the accompany communication be receive from the governor of the temporary government of oregon give information of the continuance of the indian disturbance and of the destitution and defenseless condition of the inhabitant order be immediately transmit to the commander of our squadron in the pacific to dispatch to their assistance a part of the naval force on that station to furnish they with arm and ammunition and to continue to give they such aid and protection as the navy could afford until the army could reach the country
 it be the policy of humanity and one which have always be pursue by the united states to cultivate the good will of the aboriginal tribe of this continent and to restrain they from make war and indulge in excess by mild mean rather than by force that this could have be do with the tribe in oregon have that territory be bring under the government of our law at an early period and have other suitable measure be adopt by congress such as now exist in our intercourse with the other indian tribe within our limit can not be doubt indeed the immediate and only cause of the exist hostility of the indians of oregon be represent to have be the long delay of the united states in make to they some trifling compensation in such article as they want for the country now occupy by our emigrant which the indians claim and over which they formerly roam this compensation have be promise to they by the temporary government establish in oregon but its fulfillment have be postpone from time to time for nearly two year whilst those who make it have be anxiously wait for congress to establish a territorial government over the country the indians become at length distrustful of their good faith and seek redress by plunder and massacre which finally lead to the present difficulty a few thousand dollar in suitable present as a compensation for the country which have be take possession of by our citizen would have satisfy the indians and have prevent the war a small amount properly distribute it be confidently believe would soon restore quiet in this indian war our fellow citizen of oregon have be compel to take the field in their own defense have perform valuable military service and be subject to expense which have fall heavily upon they justice demand that provision should be make by congress to compensate they for their service and to refund to they the necessary expense which they have incur
 i repeat the recommendation heretofore make to congress that provision be make for the appointment of a suitable number of indian agent to reside among the tribe of oregon and that a small sum be appropriate to enable these agent to cultivate friendly relation with they if this be do the presence of a small military force will be all that be necessary to keep they in check and preserve peace i recommend that similar provision be make as regard the tribe inhabit northern texas new mexico california and the extensive region lie between our settlement in missouri and these possession as the most effective mean of preserve peace upon our border and within the recently acquire territory
 the secretary of the treasury will present in his annual report a highly satisfactory statement of the condition of the finance
 the import for the fiscal year end on the 30th of june last be of the value of $ 154,977,876 of which the amount export be $ 21,128,010 leave $ 133,849,866 in the country for domestic use the value of the export for the same period be $ 154,032,131 consist of domestic production amount to $ 132,904,121 and $ 21,128,010 of foreign article the receipt into the treasury for the same period exclusive of loan amount to $ 35,436,750.59 of which there be derive from customs $ 31,757,070.96 from sale of public land $ 3,328,642.56 and from miscellaneous and incidental source $ 351,037.07
 it will be perceive that the revenue from custom for the last fiscal year exceed by $ 757,070.96 the estimate of the secretary of the treasury in his last annual report and that the aggregate receipt during the same period from custom land and miscellaneous source also exceed the estimate by the sum of $ 536,750.59 indicate however a very near approach in the estimate to the actual result
 the expenditure during the fiscal year end on the 30th of june last include those for the war and exclusive of payment of principal and interest for the public debt be $ 42,811,970.03
 it be estimate that the receipt into the treasury for the fiscal year end on the 30th of june 1849 include the balance in the treasury on the 1st of july last will amount to the sum of $ 57,048,969.90 of which $ 32,000,000 it be estimate will be derive from custom $ 3,000,000 from the sale of the public land and $ 1,200,000 from miscellaneous and incidental source include the premium upon the loan and the amount pay and to be pay into the treasury on account of military contribution in mexico and the sale of arm and vessel and other public property render unnecessary for the use of the government by the termination of the war and $ 20,695,435.30 from loan already negotiate include treasury note fund which together with the balance in the treasury on the 1st of july last make the sum estimate
 the expenditure for the same period include the necessary payment on account of the principal and interest of the public debt and the principal and interest of the first installment due to mexico on the 30th of may next and other expenditure grow out of the war to be pay during the present year will amount include the reimbursement of treasury note to the sum of $ 54,195,275.06 leave an estimate balance in the treasury on the 1st of july 1849 of $ 2,853,694.84
 the secretary of the treasury will present as require by law the estimate of the receipt and expenditure for the next fiscal year the expenditure as estimate for that year be $ 33,213,152.73 include $ 3,799,102.18 for the interest on the public debt and $ 3,540,000 for the principal and interest due to mexico on the 30th of may 1850 leave the sum of $ 25,874,050.35 which it be believe will be ample for the ordinary peace expenditure
 the operation of the tariff act of 1846 have be such during the past year as fully to meet the public expectation and to confirm the opinion heretofore express of the wisdom of the change in our revenue system which be effect by it the receipt under it into the treasury for the first fiscal year after its enactment exceed by the sum of $ 5,044,403.09 the amount collect during the last fiscal year under the tariff act of 1842 end the 30th of june 1846 the total revenue realize from the commencement of its operation on the 1st of december 1846 until the close of the last quarter on the 30th of september last be twenty two month be $ 56,654,563.79 be a much large sum than be ever before receive from duty during any equal period under the tariff act of 1824 1828 1832 and 1842 whilst by the repeal of highly protective and prohibitory duty the revenue have be increase the taxis on the people have be diminish they have be relieve from the heavy amount with which they be burthen under former law in the form of increase price or bounty pay to favor class and pursuit
 the prediction which be make that the tariff act of 1846 would reduce the amount of revenue below that collect under the act of 1842 and would prostrate the business and destroy the prosperity of the country have not be verify with an increased and increase revenue the finance be in a highly flourishing condition agriculture commerce and navigation be prosperous the price of manufacture fabric and of other product be much less injuriously affect than be to have be anticipate from the unprecedented revulsion which during the last and the present year have overwhelm the industry and paralyze the credit and commerce of so many great and enlightened nation of europe
 severe commercial revulsion abroad have always heretofore operate to depress and often to affect disastrously almost every branch of american industry the temporary depression of a portion of our manufacture interest be the effect of foreign cause and be far less severe than have prevail on all former similar occasion
 it be believe that look to the great aggregate of all our interest the whole country be never more prosperous than at the present period and never more rapidly advance in wealth and population neither the foreign war in which we have be involve nor the loan which have absorb so large a portion of our capital nor the commercial revulsion in great britain in 1847 nor the paralysis of credit and commerce throughout europe in 1848 have affect injuriously to any considerable extent any of the great interest of the country or arrest our onward march to greatness wealth and power
 have the disturbance in europe not occur our commerce would undoubtedly have be still more extended and would have add still more to the national wealth and public prosperity but notwithstanding these disturbance the operation of the revenue system establish by the tariff act of 1846 have be so generally beneficial to the government and the business of the country that no change in its provision be demand by a wise public policy and none be recommend
 the operation of the constitutional treasury establish by the act of the 6th of august 1846 in the receipt custody and disbursement of the public money have continue to be successful under this system the public finance have be carry through a foreign war involve the necessity of loan and extraordinary expenditure and require distant transfer and disbursement without embarrassment and no loss have occur of any of the public money deposit under its provision whilst it have prove to be safe and useful to the government its effect have be most beneficial upon the business of the country it have tend powerfully to secure an exemption from that inflation and fluctuation of the paper currency so injurious to domestic industry and render so uncertain the reward of labor and it be believe have largely contribute to preserve the whole country from a serious commercial revulsion such as often occur under the bank deposit system in the year 1847 there be a revulsion in the business of great britain of great extent and intensity which be follow by failure in that kingdom unprecedented in number and amount of loss this be believe to be the first instance when such disastrous bankruptcy occur in a country with which we have such extensive commerce produce little or no injurious effect upon our trade or currency we remain but little affect in our money market and our business and industry be still prosperous and progressive
 during the present year nearly the whole continent of europe have be convulse by civil war and revolution attend by numerous bankruptcy by an unprecedented fall in their public security and an almost universal paralysis of commerce and industry and yet although our trade and the price of our product must have be somewhat unfavorably affect by these cause we have escape a revulsion our money market be comparatively easy and public and private credit have advance and improve
 it be confidently believe that we have be save from their effect by the salutary operation of the constitutional treasury it be certain that if the twenty four million of specie import into the country during the fiscal year end on the 30th of june 1847 have go into the bank as to a great extent it must have do it would in the absence of this system have be make the basis of augmented bank paper issue probably to an amount not less than $ 60,000,000 or $ 70,000,000 produce as an inevitable consequence of an inflated currency extravagant price for a time and wild speculation which must have be follow on the reflux to europe the succeed year of so much of that specie by the prostration of the business of the country the suspension of the bank and most extensive bankruptcy occur as this would have do at a period when the country be engage in a foreign war when considerable loan of specie be require for distant disbursement and when the bank the fiscal agent of the government and the depository of its money be suspend the public credit must have sink and many million of dollar as be the case during the war of 1812 must have be sacrifice in discount upon loan and upon the depreciate paper currency which the government would have be compel to use
 under the operation of the constitutional treasury not a dollar have be lose by the depreciation of the currency the loan require to prosecute the war with mexico be negotiate by the secretary of the treasury above par realize a large premium to the government the restrain effect of the system upon the tendency to excessive paper issue by bank have save the government from heavy loss and thousand of our business man from bankruptcy and ruin the wisdom of the system have be test by the experience of the last two year and it be the dictate of sound policy that it should remain undisturbed the modification in some of the detail of this measure involve none of its essential principle heretofore recommend be again present for your favorable consideration
 in my message of the 6th of july last transmit to congress the ratified treaty of peace with mexico i recommend the adoption of measure for the speedy payment of the public debt in reiterate that recommendation i refer you to the consideration present in that message in its support the public debt include that authorize to be negotiate in pursuance of exist law and include treasury note amount at that time to $ 65,778,450.41

 the estimate of expenditure for the next fiscal year submit by the secretary of the treasury it be believe will be ample for all necessary purpose if the appropriation make by congress shall not exceed the amount estimate the mean in the treasury will be sufficient to defray all the expense of the government to pay off the next installment of $ 3,000,000 to mexico which will fall due on the 30th of may next and still a considerable surplus will remain which should be apply to the further purchase of the public stock and reduction of the debt should enlarge appropriation be make the necessary consequence will be to postpone the payment of the debt though our debt as compare with that of most other nation be small it be our true policy and in harmony with the genius of our institution that we should present to the world the rare spectacle of a great republic possess vast resource and wealth wholly exempt from public indebtedness this would add still more to our strength and give to we a still more commanding position among the nation of the earth
 the public expenditure should be economical and be confine to such necessary object as be clearly within the power of congress all such as be not absolutely demand should be postpone and the payment of the public debt at the early practicable period should be a cardinal principle of our public policy
 for the reason assign in my last annual message i repeat the recommendation that a branch of the mint of the united states be establish at the city of new york the importance of this measure be greatly increase by the acquisition of the rich mine of the precious metal in new mexico and california and especially in the latter
 i repeat the recommendation heretofore make in favor of the graduation and reduction of the price of such of the public land as have be long offer in the market and have remain unsold and in favor of extend the right of preemption to actual settler on the unsurveyed as well as the survey land

 on the return of peace our force be withdraw from mexico and the volunteer and that portion of the regular army engage for the war be disband order have be issue for station the force of our permanent establishment at various position in our extended country where troop may be require owe to the remoteness of some of these position the detachment have not yet reach their destination notwithstanding the extension of the limit of our country and the force require in the new territory it be confidently believe that our present military establishment be sufficient for all exigency so long as our peaceful relation remain undisturbed
 of the amount of military contribution collect in mexico the sum of $ 769,650 be apply toward the payment of the first installment due under the treaty with mexico the further sum of $ 346,369.30 have be pay into the treasury and unexpended balance still remain in the hand of disburse officer and those who be engage in the collection of these money after the proclamation of peace no further disbursement be make of any unexpended money arise from this source the balance on hand be direct to be pay into the treasury and individual claim on the fund will remain unadjusted until congress shall authorize their settlement and payment these claim be not considerable in number or amount
 i recommend to your favorable consideration the suggestion of the secretary of war and the secretary of the navy in regard to legislation on this subject
 our indian relation be present in a most favorable view in the report from the war department the wisdom of our policy in regard to the tribe within our limit be clearly manifest by their improved and rapidly improve condition
 a most important treaty with the menomonies have be recently negotiate by the commissioner of indian affairs in person by which all their land in the state of wisconsin be about 4,000,000 acre have be cede to the united states this treaty will be submit to the senate for ratification at an early period of your present session
 within the last four year eight important treaty have be negotiate with different indian tribe and at a cost of $ 1,842,000 indian land to the amount of more than 18,500,000 acre have be cede to the united states and provision have be make for settle in the country west of the mississippi the tribe which occupy this large extent of the public domain the title to all the indian land within the several states of our union with the exception of a few small reservation be now extinguish and a vast region open for settlement and cultivation
 the accompanying report of the secretary of the navy give a satisfactory exhibit of the operation and condition of that branch of the public service
 a number of small vessel suitable for enter the mouth of river be judiciously purchase during the war and give great efficiency to the squadron in the gulf of mexico on the return of peace when no long valuable for naval purpose and liable to constant deterioration they be sell and the money place in the treasury
 the number of man in the naval service authorize by law during the war have be reduce by discharge below the maximum fix for the peace establishment adequate squadron be maintain in the several quarter of the globe where experience have show their service may be most usefully employ and the naval service be never in a condition of high discipline or great efficiency
 i invite attention to the recommendation of the secretary of the navy on the subject of the marine corps the reduction of the corps at the end of the war require that four officer of each of the three low grade should be drop from the roll a board of officer make the selection and those designate be necessarily dismiss but without any allege fault i concur in opinion with the secretary that the service would be improve by reduce the number of landsman and increase the marine such a measure would justify an increase of the number of officer to the extent of the reduction by dismissal and still the corps would have few officer than a correspond number of man in the army
 the contract for the transportation of the mail in steamship convertible into war steamer promise to realize all the benefit to our commerce and to the navy which be anticipate the first steamer thus secure to the government be launch in january 1847 there be now seven and in another year there will probably be not less than seventeen afloat while this great national advantage be secure our social and commercial intercourse be increase and promote with germany great britain and other part of europe with all the country on the west coast of our continent especially with oregon and california and between the northern and southern section of the united states considerable revenue may be expect from postage but the connected line from new york to chagre and thence across the isthmus to oregon can not fail to exert a beneficial influence not now to be estimate on the interest of the manufacture commerce navigation and currency of the united states as an important part of the system i recommend to your favorable consideration the establishment of the propose line of steamer between new orleans and vera cruz it promise the most happy result in cement friendship between the two republics and extend reciprocal benefit to the trade and manufacture of both
 the report of the postmaster general will make known to you the operation of that department for the past year
 it be gratify to find the revenue of the department under the rate of postage now establish by law so rapidly increase the gross amount of postage during the last fiscal year amount to $ 4,371,077 exceed the annual average receive for the nine year immediately precede the passage of the act of the 3d of march 1845 by the sum of $ 6,453 and exceed the amount receive for the year end the 30th of june 1847 by the sum of $ 425,184
 the expenditure for the year exclude the sum of $ 94,672 allow by congress at its last session to individual claimant and include the sum of $ 100,500 pay for the service of the line of steamer between bremen and new york amount to $ 4,198,845 which be less than the annual average for the nine year previous to the act of 1845 by $ 300,748
 the mail route on the 30th day of june last be 163,208 mile in extent be an increase during the last year of 9,390 mile the mail be transport over they during the same time 41,012,579 mile make an increase of transportation for the year of 2,124,680 mile whilst the expense be less than that of the previous year by $ 4,235
 the increase in the mail transportation within the last three year have be 5,378,310 mile whilst the expense be reduce $ 456,738 make an increase of service at the rate of 15 per cent and a reduction in the expense of more than 15 per cent
 during the past year there have be employ under contract with the post office department two ocean steamer in convey the mail monthly between new york and bremen and one since october last perform semimonthly service between charleston and havana and a contract have be make for the transportation of the pacific mail across the isthmus from chagres to panama
 under the authority give to the secretary of the navy three ocean steamer have be construct and send to the pacific and be expect to enter upon the mail service between panama and oregon and the intermediate port on the 1st of january next and a fourth have be engage by he for the service between havana and chagres so that a regular monthly mail line will be keep up after that time between the united states and our territory on the pacific
 notwithstanding this great increase in the mail service should the revenue continue to increase the present year as it do in the last there will be receive near $ 450,000 more than the expenditure
 these consideration have satisfy the postmaster general that with certain modification of the act of 1845 the revenue may be still far increase and a reduction of postage make to a uniform rate of 5 cent without an interference with the principle which have be constantly and properly enforce of make that department sustain itself
 a well digest cheap postage system be the good mean of diffuse intelligence among the people and be of so much importance in a country so extensive as that of the united states that i recommend to your favorable consideration the suggestion of the postmaster general for its improvement
 nothing can retard the onward progress of our country and prevent we from assume and maintain the first rank among nation but a disregard of the experience of the past and a recurrence to an unwise public policy we have just close a foreign war by an honorable peace a war render necessary and unavoidable in vindication of the national right and honor the present condition of the country be similar in some respect to that which exist immediately after the close of the war with great britain in 1815 and the occasion be deem to be a proper one to take a retrospect of the measure of public policy which follow that war there be at that period of our history a departure from our early policy the enlargement of the power of the federal government by construction which obtain be not warrant by any just interpretation of the constitution a few year after the close of that war a series of measure be adopt which unite and combine constitute what be term by their author and advocate the american system
 the introduction of the new policy be for a time favor by the condition of the country by the heavy debt which have be contract during the war by the depression of the public credit by the derange state of the finance and the currency and by the commercial and pecuniary embarrassment which extensively prevail these be not the only cause which lead to its establishment the event of the war with great britain and the embarrassment which have attend its prosecution have leave on the mind of many of our statesman the impression that our government be not strong enough and that to wield its resource successfully in great emergency and especially in war more power should be concentrate in its hand this increase power they do not seek to obtain by the legitimate and prescribed mode an amendment of the constitution but by construction they see government in the old world base upon different order of society and so constitute as to throw the whole power of nation into the hand of a few who tax and control the many without responsibility or restraint in that arrangement they conceive the strength of nation in war consist there be also something fascinating in the ease luxury and display of the high order who draw their wealth from the toil of the labor million the author of the system draw their idea of political economy from what they have witness in europe and particularly in great britain they have view the enormous wealth concentrate in few hand and have see the splendor of the overgrown establishment of an aristocracy which be uphold by the restrictive policy they forget to look down upon the poor class of the english population upon whose daily and yearly labor the great establishment they so much admire be sustain and support they fail to perceive that the scantily feed and half clothe operative be not only in abject poverty but be bind in chain of oppressive servitude for the benefit of favor class who be the exclusive object of the care of the government
 it be not possible to reconstruct society in the united states upon the european plan here there be a write constitution by which order and title be not recognize or tolerate a system of measure be therefore devised calculate if not intend to withdraw power gradually and silently from the states and the mass of the people and by construction to approximate our government to the european model substitute an aristocracy of wealth for that of order and title
 without reflect upon the dissimilarity of our institution and of the condition of our people and those of europe they conceive the vain idea of build up in the united states a system similar to that which they admire abroad great britain have a national bank of large capital in whose hand be concentrate the control monetary and financial power of the nation an institution wield almost kingly power and exert vast influence upon all the operation of trade and upon the policy of the government itself great britain have an enormous public debt and it have become a part of her public policy to regard this as a public blessing great britain have also a restrictive policy which place fetter and burden on trade and trammel the productive industry of the mass of the nation by her combine system of policy the landlord and other property holder be protect and enrich by the enormous taxis which be levy upon the labor of the country for their advantage imitate this foreign policy the first step in establish the new system in the united states be the creation of a national bank not foresee the dangerous power and countless evil which such an institution might entail on the country nor perceive the connection which it be design to form between the bank and the other branch of the miscalled american system but feel the embarrassment of the treasury and of the business of the country consequent upon the war some of our statesman who have hold different and sounder view be induce to yield their scruple and indeed settle conviction of its unconstitutionality and to give it their sanction as an expedient which they vainly hope might produce relief it be a most unfortunate error as the subsequent history and final catastrophe of that dangerous and corrupt institution have abundantly prove the bank with its numerous branch ramify into the states soon bring many of the active political and commercial man in different section of the country into the relation of debtor to it and dependent upon it for pecuniary favor thus diffuse throughout the mass of society a great number of individual of power and influence to give tone to public opinion and to act in concert in case of emergency the corrupt power of such a political engine be no long a matter of speculation having be display in numerous instance but most signally in the political struggle of 1832 1833 and 1834 in opposition to the public will represent by a fearless and patriotic president
 but the bank be but one branch of the new system a public debt of more than $ 120,000,000 exist and it be not to be disguise that many of the author of the new system do not regard its speedy payment as essential to the public prosperity but look upon its continuance as no national evil whilst the debt exist it furnish aliment to the national bank and render increase taxation necessary to the amount of the interest exceed $ 7,000,000 annually
 this operate in harmony with the next branch of the new system which be a high protective tariff this be to afford bounty to favor class and particular pursuit at the expense of all other a proposition to tax the whole people for the purpose of enrich a few be too monstrous to be openly make the scheme be therefore veil under the plausible but delusive pretext of a measure to protect home industry and many of our people be for a time lead to believe that a tax which in the main fall upon labor be for the benefit of the laborer who pay it this branch of the system involve a partnership between the government and the favored class the former receive the proceed of the tax impose on article import and the latter the increase price of similar article produce at home cause by such tax it be obvious that the portion to be receive by the favor class would as a general rule be increase in proportion to the increase of the rate of tax impose and diminish as those rate be reduce to the revenue standard require by the want of the government the rate require to produce a sufficient revenue for the ordinary expenditure of government for necessary purpose be not likely to give to the private partner in this scheme profit sufficient to satisfy their cupidity and hence a variety of expedient and pretext be resort to for the purpose of enlarge the expenditure and thereby create a necessity for keep up a high protective tariff the effect of this policy be to interpose artificial restriction upon the natural course of the business and trade of the country and to advance the interest of large capitalist and monopolist at the expense of the great mass of the people who be tax to increase their wealth
 another branch of this system be a comprehensive scheme of internal improvement capable of indefinite enlargement and sufficient to swallow up as many million annually as could be exact from the foreign commerce of the country this be a convenient and necessary adjunct of the protective tariff it be to be the great absorbent of any surplus which might at any time accumulate in the treasury and of the taxis levy on the people not for necessary revenue purpose but for the avow object of afford protection to the favor class
 auxiliary to the same end if it be not an essential part of the system itself be the scheme which at a later period obtain for distribute the proceed of the sale of the public land among the states other expedient be devise to take money out of the treasury and prevent its come in from any other source than the protective tariff the author and supporter of the system be the advocate of the large expenditure whether for necessary or useful purpose or not because the large the expenditure the great be the pretext for high taxis in the form of protective duty
 these several measure be sustain by popular name and plausible argument by which thousand be delude the bank be represent to be an indispensable fiscal agent for the government be to equalize exchange and to regulate and furnish a sound currency always and everywhere of uniform value the protective tariff be to give employment to american labor at advanced price be to protect home industry and furnish a steady market for the farmer internal improvement be to bring trade into every neighborhood and enhance the value of every man&#39;s property the distribution of the land money be to enrich the states finish their public work plant school throughout their border and relieve they from taxation but the fact that for every dollar take out of the treasury for these object a much large sum be transfer from the pocket of the people to the favor class be carefully conceal as be also the tendency if not the ultimate design of the system to build up an aristocracy of wealth to control the masse of society and monopolize the political power of the country
 the several branch of this system be so intimately blend together that in their operation each sustain and strengthen the other their joint operation be to add new burthen of taxation and to encourage a largely increased and wasteful expenditure of public money it be the interest of the bank that the revenue collect and the disbursement make by the government should be large because be the depository of the public money the large the amount the great would be the bank profit by its use it be the interest of the favor class who be enrich by the protective tariff to have the rate of that protection as high as possible for the high those rate the great would be their advantage it be the interest of the people of all those section and locality who expect to be benefit by expenditure for internal improvement that the amount collect should be as large as possible to the end that the sum disburse might also be the large the states be the beneficiary in the distribution of the land money have an interest in have the rate of tax impose by the protective tariff large enough to yield a sufficient revenue from that source to meet the want of the government without disturb or take from they the land fund so that each of the branch constitute the system have a common interest in swell the public expenditure they have a direct interest in maintain the public debt unpaid and increase its amount because this would produce an annual increase drain upon the treasury to the amount of the interest and render augment taxis necessary the operation and necessary effect of the whole system be to encourage large and extravagant expenditure and thereby to increase the public patronage and maintain a rich and splendid government at the expense of a taxed and impoverished people
 it be manifest that this scheme of enlarged taxation and expenditure have it continue to prevail must soon have convert the government of the union intend by its framer to be a plain cheap and simple confederation of states unite together for common protection and charge with a few specific duty relate chiefly to our foreign affair into a consolidated empire deprive the states of their reserve right and the people of their just power and control in the administration of their government in this manner the whole form and character of the government would be change not by an amendment of the constitution but by resort to an unwarrantable and unauthorized construction of that instrument
 the indirect mode of levy the taxis by a duty on import prevent the mass of the people from readily perceive the amount they pay and have enable the few who be thus enrich and who seek to wield the political power of the country to deceive and delude they be the taxis collect by a direct levy upon the people as be the ease in the states this could not occur
 the whole system be resist from its inception by many of our able statesman some of whom doubt its constitutionality and its expediency while other believe it be in all its branch a flagrant and dangerous infraction of the constitution
 that a national bank a protective tariff levy not to raise the revenue need but for protection merely internal improvement and the distribution of the proceed of the sale of the public land be measure without the warrant of the constitution would upon the mature consideration seem to be clear it be remarkable that no one of these measure involve such momentous consequence be authorize by any express grant of power in the constitution no one of they be incident to as be necessary and proper for the execution of the specific power grant by the constitution the authority under which it have be attempt to justify each of they be derive from inference and construction of the constitution which its letter and its whole object and design do not warrant be it to be conceive that such immense power would have be leave by the framer of the constitution to mere inference and doubtful construction have it be intend to confer they on the federal government it be but reasonable to conclude that it would have be do by plain and unequivocal grant this be not do but the whole structure of which the american system consist be rear on no other or well foundation than force implication and inference of power which its author assume might be deduce by construction from the constitution
 but it have be urge that the national bank which constitute so essential a branch of this combine system of measure be not a new measure and that its constitutionality have be previously sanction because a bank have be charter in 1791 and have receive the official signature of president washington a few fact will show the just weight to which this precedent should be entitle as bear upon the question of constitutionality
 great division of opinion upon the subject exist in congress it be well know that president washington entertain serious doubt both as to the constitutionality and expediency of the measure and while the bill be before he for his official approval or disapproval so great be these doubt that he require the opinion in writing of the member of his cabinet to aid he in arrive at a decision his cabinet give their opinion and be divide upon the subject general hamilton be in favor of and mr. jefferson and mr. randolph be oppose to the constitutionality and expediency of the bank it be well know also that president washington retain the bill from monday the 14th when it be present to he until friday the 25th of february be the last moment permit he by the constitution to deliberate when he finally yield to it his reluctant assent and give it his signature it be certain that as late as the 23d of february be the ninth day after the bill be present to he he have arrive at no satisfactory conclusion for on that day he address a note to general hamilton in which he inform he that this bill be present to i by the joint committee of congress at 12 o&#39;clock on monday the 14th instant and he request his opinion to what precise period by legal interpretation of the constitution can the president retain it in his possession before it become a law by the lapse of ten day if the proper construction be that the day on which the bill be present to the president and the day on which his action be have upon it be both to be count inclusive then the time allow he within which it would be competent for he to return it to the house in which it originate with his objection would expire on thursday the 24th of february general hamilton on the same day return an answer in which he state
 i give it as my opinion that you have ten day exclusive of that on which the bill be deliver to you and sunday hence in the present case if it be return on friday it will be in time
 by this construction which the president adopt he gain another day for deliberation and it be not until the 25th of february that he sign the bill thus afford conclusive proof that he have at last obtain his own consent to sign it not without great and almost insuperable difficulty additional light have be recently shed upon the serious doubt which he have on the subject amount at one time to a conviction that it be his duty to withhold his approval from the bill this be find among the manuscript paper of mr. madison authorize to be purchase for the use of the government by an act of the last session of congress and now for the first time accessible to the public from these paper it appear that president washington while he yet hold the bank bill in his hand actually request mr. madison at that time a member of the house of representatives to prepare the draft of a veto message for he mr. madison at his request do prepare the draft of such a message and send it to he on the 21st of february 1791 a copy of this original draft in mr. madison&#39;s own handwriting be carefully preserve by he and be among the paper lately purchase by congress it be precede by a note write on the same sheet which be also in mr. madison&#39;s handwriting and be as follow
 february 21 1791.--copy of a paper make out and send to the president at his request to be ready in case his judgment should finally decide against the bill for incorporate a national bank the bill be then before he
 among the objection assign in this paper to the bill and which be submit for the consideration of the president be the follow
 i object to the bill because it be an essential principle of the government that power not delegate by the constitution can not be rightfully exercise because the power propose by the bill to be exercise be not expressly delegate and because i can not satisfy myself that it result from any express power by fair and safe rule of interpretation
 the weight of the precedent of the bank of 1791 and the sanction of the great name of washington which have be so often invoke in its support be greatly weaken by the development of these fact
 the experiment of that bank satisfy the country that it ought not to be continue and at the end of twenty year congress refuse to recharter it it would have be fortunate for the country and save thousand from bankruptcy and ruin have our public man of 1816 resist the temporary pressure of the time upon our financial and pecuniary interest and refuse to charter the second bank of this the country become abundantly satisfied and at the close of its twenty years&#39 duration as in the case of the first bank it also cease to exist under the repeat blow of president jackson it reel and fall and a subsequent attempt to charter a similar institution be arrest by the veto of president tyler
 mr. madison in yield his signature to the charter of 1816 do so upon the ground of the respect due to precedent and as he subsequently declared--
 the bank of the united states though on the original question hold to be unconstitutional receive the executive signature
 it be probable that neither the bank of 1791 nor that of 1816 would have be charter but for the embarrassment of the government in its finance the derangement of the currency and the pecuniary pressure which exist the first the consequence of the war of the revolution and the second the consequence of the war of 1812 both be resort to in the delusive hope that they would restore public credit and afford relief to the government and to the business of the country
 those of our public man who oppose the whole american system at its commencement and throughout its progress foresaw and predict that it be fraught with incalculable mischief and must result in serious injury to the good interest of the country for a series of year their wise counsel be unheeded and the system be establish it be soon apparent that its practical operation be unequal and unjust upon different portion of the country and upon the people engage in different pursuit all be equally entitle to the favor and protection of the government it foster and elevate the money power and enrich the favor few by tax labor and at the expense of the many its effect be to make the rich rich and the poor poor its tendency be to create distinction in society base on wealth and to give to the favored class undue control and sway in our government it be an organize money power which resist the popular will and seek to shape and control the public policy
 under the pernicious working of this combine system of measure the country witness alternate season of temporary apparent prosperity of sudden and disastrous commercial revulsion of unprecedented fluctuation of price and depression of the great interest of agriculture navigation and commerce of general pecuniary suffering and of final bankruptcy of thousand after a severe struggle of more than a quarter of a century the system be overthrow
 the bank have be succeed by a practical system of finance conduct and control solely by the government the constitutional currency have be restore the public credit maintain unimpaire even in a period of a foreign war and the whole country have become satisfied that bank national or state be not necessary as fiscal agent of the government revenue duty have take the place of the protective tariff the distribution of the money derive from the sale of the public land have be abandon and the corrupting system of internal improvement it be hope have be effectually check
 it be not doubted that if this whole train of measure design to take wealth from the many and bestow it upon the few be to prevail the effect would be to change the entire character of the government one only danger remain it be the seduction of that branch of the system which consist in internal improvement hold out as it do inducement to the people of particular section and locality to embark the government in they without stop to calculate the inevitable consequence this branch of the system be so intimately combine and link with the other that as surely as an effect be produce by an adequate cause if it be resuscitate and revive and firmly establish it require no sagacity to foresee that it will necessarily and speedily draw after it the reestablishment of a national bank the revival of a protective tariff the distribution of the land money and not only the postponement to the distant future of the payment of the present national debt but its annual increase
 i entertain the solemn conviction that if the internal improvement branch of the american system be not firmly resist at this time the whole series of measure compose it will be speedily reestablish and the country be throw back from its present high state of prosperity which the exist policy have produce and be destine again to witness all the evil commercial revulsion depression of price and pecuniary embarrassment through which we have pass during the last twenty five year
 to guard against consequence so ruinous be an object of high national importance involve in my judgment the continue prosperity of the country
 i have feel it to be an imperative obligation to withhold my constitutional sanction from two bill which have pass the two houses of congress involve the principle of the internal improvement branch of the american system and conflict in their provision with the view here express
 this power confer upon the president by the constitution i have on three occasion during my administration of the executive department of the government deem it my duty to exercise and on this last occasion of make to congress an annual communication of the state of the union it be not deem inappropriate to review the principle and consideration which have govern my action i deem this the more necessary because after the lapse of nearly sixty year since the adoption of the constitution the propriety of the exercise of this undoubted constitutional power by the president have for the first time be draw seriously in question by a portion of my fellow citizen
 the constitution provide that--
 every bill which shall have pass the house of representatives and the senate shall before it become a law be present to the president of the united states if he approve he shall sign it but if not he shall return it with his objection to that house in which it shall have originate who shall enter the objection at large on their journal and proceed to reconsider it
 the preservation of the constitution from infraction be the president&#39;s high duty he be bind to discharge that duty at whatever hazard of incur the displeasure of those who may differ with he in opinion he be bind to discharge it as well by his obligation to the people who have clothe he with his exalt trust as by his oath of office which he may not disregard nor be the obligation of the president in any degree lessen by the prevalence of view different from his own in one or both houses of congress it be not alone hasty and inconsiderate legislation that he be require to check but if at any time congress shall after apparently full deliberation resolve on measure which he deem subversive of the constitution or of the vital interest of the country it be his solemn duty to stand in the breach and resist they the president be bind to approve or disapprove every bill which pass congress and be present to he for his signature the constitution make this his duty and he can not escape it if he would he have no election in decide upon any bill present to he he must exercise his own good judgment if he can not approve the constitution command he to return the bill to the house in which it originate with his objection and if he fail to do this within ten day sunday except it shall become a law without his signature right or wrong he may be overrule by a vote of two third of each house and in that event the bill become a law without his sanction if his objection be not thus overrule the subject be only postpone and be refer to the states and the people for their consideration and decision the president&#39;s power be negative merely and not affirmative he can enact no law the only effect therefore of his withholding his approval of a bill pass by congress be to suffer the exist law to remain unchanged and the delay occasion be only that require to enable the states and the people to consider and act upon the subject in the election of public agent who will carry out their wish and instruction any attempt to coerce the president to yield his sanction to measure which he can not approve would be a violation of the spirit of the constitution palpable and flagrant and if successful would break down the independence of the executive department and make the president elect by the people and clothe by the constitution with power to defend their right the mere instrument of a majority of congress a surrender on his part of the power with which the constitution have invest his office would effect a practical alteration of that instrument without resort to the prescribed process of amendment
 with the motive or consideration which may induce congress to pass any bill the president can have nothing to do he must presume they to be as pure as his own and look only to the practical effect of their measure when compare with the constitution or the public good
 but it have be urge by those who object to the exercise of this undoubted constitutional power that it assail the representative principle and the capacity of the people to govern themselves that there be great safety in a numerous representative body than in the single executive create by the constitution and that the executive veto be a one man power despotic in its character to expose the fallacy of this objection it be only necessary to consider the frame and true character of our system ours be not a consolidated empire but a confederate union the states before the adoption of the constitution be coordinate co equal and separate independent sovereignty and by its adoption they do not lose that character they clothe the federal government with certain power and reserve all other include their own sovereignty to themselves they guard their own right as states and the right of the people by the very limitation which they incorporate into the federal constitution whereby the different department of the general government be check upon each other that the majority should govern be a general principle controvert by none but they must govern accord to the constitution and not accord to an undefined and unrestrained discretion whereby they may oppress the minority
 the people of the united states be not blind to the fact that they may be temporarily mislead and that their representative legislative and executive may be mistake or influence in their action by improper motive they have therefore interpose between themselves and the law which may be pass by their public agent various representation such as assembly senate and governor in their several states a house of representatives a senate and a president of the united states the people can by their own direct agency make no law nor can the house of representatives immediately elect by they nor can the senate nor can both together without the concurrence of the president or a vote of two third of both houses
 happily for themselves the people in frame our admirable system of government be conscious of the infirmity of their representative and in delegate to they the power of legislation they have fence they around with check to guard against the effect of hasty action of error of combination and of possible corruption error selfishness and faction have often seek to rend asunder this web of check and subject the government to the control of fanatic and sinister influence but these effort have only satisfy the people of the wisdom of the check which they have impose and of the necessity of preserve they unimpaired
 the true theory of our system be not to govern by the act or decree of any one set of representative the constitution interpose check upon all branch of the government in order to give time for error to be correct and delusion to pass away but if the people settle down into a firm conviction different from that of their representative they give effect to their opinion by change their public servant the check which the people impose on their public servant in the adoption of the constitution be the good evidence of their capacity for self government they know that the man whom they elect to public station be of like infirmity and passion with themselves and not to be trust without be restrict by coordinate authority and constitutional limitation who that have witness the legislation of congress for the last thirty year will say that he know of no instance in which measure not demand by the public good have be carry who will deny that in the state government by combination of individual and section in derogation of the general interest bank have be charter system of internal improvement adopt and debt entail upon the people repress their growth and impair their energy for year to come
 after so much experience it can not be say that absolute unchecked power be safe in the hand of any one set of representative or that the capacity of the people for self government which be admit in its broad extent be a conclusive argument to prove the prudence wisdom and integrity of their representative
 the people by the constitution have command the president as much as they have command the legislative branch of the government to execute their will they have say to he in the constitution which they require he shall take a solemn oath to support that if congress pass any bill which he can not approve he shall return it to the house in which it originate with his objection in withholding from it his approval and signature he be execute the will of the people constitutionally express as much as the congress that pass it no bill be presume to be in accordance with the popular will until it shall have pass through all the branch of the government require by the constitution to make it a law a bill which pass the house of representatives may be reject by the senate and so a bill pass by the senate may be reject by the house in each case the respective houses exercise the veto power on the other
 congress and each house of congress hold under the constitution a check upon the president and he by the power of the qualified veto a check upon congress when the president recommend measure to congress he avow in the most solemn form his opinion give his voice in their favor and pledge himself in advance to approve they if pass by congress if he act without due consideration or have be influence by improper or corrupt motive or if from any other cause congress or either house of congress shall differ with he in opinion they exercise their veto upon his recommendation and reject they and there be no appeal from their decision but to the people at the ballot box these be proper check upon the executive wisely interpose by the constitution none will be find to object to they or to wish they remove it be equally important that the constitutional check of the executive upon the legislative branch should be preserve
 if it be say that the representatives in the popular branch of congress be choose directly by the people it be answer the people elect the president if both house represent the states and the people so do the president the president represent in the executive department the whole people of the united states as each member of the legislative department represent portion of they
 the doctrine of restriction upon legislative and executive power while a well settle public opinion be enable within a reasonable time to accomplish its end have make our country what it be and have open to we a career of glory and happiness to which all other nation have be stranger
 in the exercise of the power of the veto the president be responsible not only to an enlightened public opinion but to the people of the whole union who elect he as the representative in the legislative branch who differ with he in opinion be responsible to the people of particular state or district who compose their respective constituency to deny to the president the exercise of this power would be to repeal that provision of the constitution which confer it upon he to charge that its exercise unduly control the legislative will be to complain of the constitution itself
 if the presidential veto be object to upon the ground that it check and thwart the popular will upon the same principle the equality of representation of the states in the senate should be stricken out of the constitution the vote of a senator from delaware have equal weight in decide upon the most important measure with the vote of a senator from new york and yet the one represent a state contain accord to the exist apportionment of representatives in the house of representatives but one thirty fourth part of the population of the other by the constitutional composition of the senate a majority of that body from the small states represent less than one fourth of the people of the union there be thirty state and under the exist apportionment of representatives there be 230 member in the house of representatives sixteen of the small states be represent in that house by but 50 member and yet the senators from these states constitute a majority of the senate so that the president may recommend a measure to congress and it may receive the sanction and approval of more than three fourth of the house of representatives and of all the senators from the large state contain more than three fourth of the whole population of the united states and yet the measure may be defeat by the vote of the senators from the small state none it be presume can be find ready to change the organization of the senate on this account or to strike that body practically out of existence by require that its action shall be conform to the will of the more numerous branch
 upon the same principle that the veto of the president should be practically abolish the power of the vice president to give the cast vote upon an equal division of the senate should be abolish also the vice president exercise the veto power as effectually by reject a bill by his cast vote as the president do by refuse to approve and sign it this power have be exercise by the vice president in a few instance the most important of which be the rejection of the bill to recharter the bank of the united states in 1811 it may happen that a bill may be pass by a large majority of the house of representatives and may be support by the senators from the large state and the vice president may reject it by give his vote with the senators from the small states and yet none it be presume be prepared to deny to he the exercise of this power under the constitution
 but it be in point of fact untrue that an act pass by congress be conclusive evidence that it be an emanation of the popular will a majority of the whole number elect to each house of congress constitute a quorum and a majority of that quorum be competent to pass law it might happen that a quorum of the house of representatives consist of a single member more than half of the whole number elect to that house might pass a bill by a majority of a single vote and in that case a fraction more than one fourth of the people of the united states would be represent by those who vote for it it might happen that the same bill might be pass by a majority of one of a quorum of the senate compose of senators from the fifteen small states and a single senator from a sixteenth state and if the senator vote for it happen to be from the eight of the small of these states it would be pass by the vote of senator from states have but fourteen representatives in the house of representatives and contain less than one sixteenth of the whole population of the united states this extreme case be state to illustrate the fact that the mere passage of a bill by congress be no conclusive evidence that those who pass it represent the majority of the people of the united states or truly reflect their will if such an extreme case be not likely to happen case that approximate it be of constant occurrence it be believe that not a single law have be pass since the adoption of the constitution upon which all the member elect to both houses have be present and vote many of the most important act which have pass congress have be carry by a close vote in thin house many instance of this might be give indeed our experience prove that many of the most important act of congress be postpone to the last day and often the last hour of a session when they be dispose of in haste and by houses but little exceed the number necessary to form a quorum
 besides in most of the states the member of the house of representatives be choose by plurality and not by majority of all the voter in their respective district and it may happen that a majority of that house may be return by a less aggregate vote of the people than that receive by the minority
 if the principle insist on be sound then the constitution should be so changed that no bill shall become a law unless it be vote for by member represent in each house a majority of the whole people of the united states we must remodel our whole system strike down and abolish not only the salutary check lodge in the executive branch but must strike out and abolish those lodge in the senate also and thus practically invest the whole power of the government in a majority of a single assembly a majority uncontrolle and absolute and which may become despotic to conform to this doctrine of the right of majority to rule independent of the check and limitation of the constitution we must revolutionize our whole system we must destroy the constitutional compact by which the several states agree to form a federal union and rush into consolidation which must end in monarchy or despotism no one advocate such a proposition and yet the doctrine maintain if carry out must lead to this result
 one great object of the constitution in confer upon the president a qualified negative upon the legislation of congress be to protect minority from injustice and oppression by majority the equality of their representation in the senate and the veto power of the president be the constitutional guaranty which the small state have that their right will be respect without these guaranty all their interest would be at the mercy of majority in congress represent the large state to the small and weak state therefore the preservation of this power and its exercise upon proper occasion demand it be of vital importance they ratify the constitution and enter into the union secure to themselves an equal representation with the large state in the senate and they agree to be bind by all law pass by congress upon the express condition and none other that they should be approve by the president or pass his objection to the contrary notwithstanding by a vote of two third of both houses upon this condition they have a right to insist as a part of the compact to which they give their assent
 a bill might be pass by congress against the will of the whole people of a particular state and against the vote of its senators and all its representatives however prejudicial it might be to the interest of such state it would be bind by it if the president shall approve it or it shall be pass by a vote of two third of both houses but it have a right to demand that the president shall exercise his constitutional power and arrest it if his judgment be against it if he surrender this power or fail to exercise it in a case where he can not approve it would make his formal approval a mere mockery and would be itself a violation of the constitution and the dissent state would become bind by a law which have not be pass accord to the sanction of the constitution
 the objection to the exercise of the veto power be found upon an idea respect the popular will which if carry out would annihilate state sovereignty and substitute for the present federal government a consolidation direct by a suppose numerical majority a revolution of the government would be silently effect and the states would be subject to law to which they have never give their constitutional consent
 the supreme court of the united states be invest with the power to declare and have declare act of congress pass with the concurrence of the senate the house of representatives and the approval of the president to be unconstitutional and void and yet none it be presume can be find who will be dispose to strip this high judicial tribunal under the constitution of this acknowledge power a power necessary alike to its independence and the right of individual
 for the same reason that the executive veto should accord to the doctrine maintain be render nugatory and be practically expunge from the constitution this power of the court should also be render nugatory and be expunge because it restrain the legislative and executive will and because the exercise of such a power by the court may be regard as be in conflict with the capacity of the people to govern themselves indeed there be more reason for strike this power of the court from the constitution than there be that of the qualified veto of the president because the decision of the court be final and can never be reverse even though both houses of congress and the president should be unanimous in opposition to it whereas the veto of the president may be overrule by a vote of two third of both houses of congress or by the people at the poll
 it be obvious that to preserve the system establish by the constitution each of the coordinate branch of the government the executive legislative and judicial must be leave in the exercise of its appropriate power if the executive or the judicial branch be deprive of power confer upon either as check on the legislative the preponderance of the latter will become disproportionate and absorbing and the other impotent for the accomplishment of the great object for which they be establish organize as they be by the constitution they work together harmoniously for the public good if the executive and the judiciary shall be deprive of the constitutional power invest in they and of their due proportion the equilibrium of the system must be destroy and consolidation with the most pernicious result must ensue a consolidation of unchecked despotic power exercise by majority of the legislative branch
 the executive legislative and judicial each constitute a separate coordinate department of the government and each be independent of the other in the performance of their respective duty under the constitution neither can in its legitimate action control the other they each act upon their several responsibility in their respective sphere but if the doctrine now maintain be correct the executive must become practically subordinate to the legislative and the judiciary must become subordinate to both the legislative and the executive and thus the whole power of the government would be merge in a single department whenever if ever this shall occur our glorious system of well regulate self government will crumble into ruin to be succeed first by anarchy and finally by monarchy or despotism i be far from believe that this doctrine be the sentiment of the american people and during the short period which remain in which it will be my duty to administer the executive department it will be my aim to maintain its independence and discharge its duty without infringe upon the power or duty of either of the other department of the government
 the power of the executive veto be exercise by the first and most illustrious of my predecessor and by four of his successor who precede i in the administration of the government and it be believe in no instance prejudicially to the public interest it have never be and there be but little danger that it ever can be abuse no president will ever desire unnecessarily to place his opinion in opposition to that of congress he must always exercise the power reluctantly and only in case where his conviction make it a matter of stern duty which he can not escape indeed there be more danger that the president from the repugnance he must always feel to come in collision with congress may fail to exercise it in case where the preservation of the constitution from infraction or the public good may demand it than that he will ever exercise it unnecessarily or wantonly
 during the period i have administer the executive department of the government great and important question of public policy foreign and domestic have arise upon which it be my duty to act it may indeed be truly say that my administration have fall upon eventful time i have feel most sensibly the weight of the high responsibility devolve upon i with no other object than the public good the endure fame and permanent prosperity of my country i have pursue the conviction of my own good judgment the impartial arbitrament of enlightened public opinion present and future will determine how far the public policy i have maintain and the measure i have from time to time recommend may have tend to advance or retard the public prosperity at home and to elevate or depress the estimate of our national character abroad
 invoke the blessing of the almighty upon your deliberation at your present important session my ardent hope be that in a spirit of harmony and concord you may be guide to wise result and such as may redound to the happiness the honor and the glory of our beloved country

to the house of representatives of the united states
  in answer to the resolution of the house of representatives of the 18th of december 1848 request information under what law or provision of the constitution or by what other authority the secretary of the treasury with the sanction and approval of the president establish a tariff of duty in the port of the mexican republic during the war with mexico and by what legal constitutional or other authority the revenue thus derive be appropriate to the support of the army in mexico i refer the house to my annual message of the 7th of december 1847 to my message to the senate of the 10th of february 1848 respond to a call of that body a copy of which be herewith communicate and to my message to the house of representatives of the 24th of july 1848 respond to a call of that house the resolution assume that the secretary of the treasury establish a tariff of duty in the port of the mexican republic the contribution collect in this mode be not establish by the secretary of the treasury but by a military order issue by the president through the war and navy departments for his information the president direct the secretary of the treasury to prepare and report to he a scale of duty that report be make and the president 's military order of the 31st of march 1847 be base upon it the document communicate to congress with my annual message of december 1847 show the true character of that order
  the authority under which military contribution be exact and collect from the enemy and apply to the support of our army during the war with mexico be state in the several message refer to in the first of these message i inform congress that—<br > on the 31st of march last i cause an order to be issue to our military and naval commander to levy and collect a military contribution upon all vessel and merchandise which might enter any of the port of mexico in our military occupation and to apply such contribution toward defray the expense of the war by virtue of the right of conquest and the law of war the conqueror consult his own safety or convenience may either exclude foreign commerce altogether from all such port or permit it upon such term and condition as he may prescribe before the principal port of mexico be blockade by our navy the revenue derive from import duty under the law of mexico be pay into the mexican treasury after these port have fall into our military possession the blockade be raise and commerce with they permit upon prescribe term and condition they be open to the trade of all nation upon the payment of duty more moderate in their amount than those which have be previously levy by mexico and the revenue which be formerly pay into the mexican treasury be direct to be collect by our military and naval officer and apply to the use of our army and navy care be take that the officer soldier and sailor of our army and navy should be exempt from the operation of the order and as the merchandise import upon which the order operate must be consume by mexican citizen the contribution exact be in effect the seizure of the public revenue of mexico and the application of they to our own use in direct this measure the object be to compel the enemy to contribute as far as practicable toward the expense of the war
  it be also state in that message that—<br > measure have recently be adopt by which the internal as well as the external revenue of mexico in all place in our military occupation will be seize and appropriate to the use of our army and navy.<br > the policy of levy upon the enemy contribution in every form consistently with the law of nation which it may be practicable for our military commander to adopt should in my judgment be rigidly enforce and order to this effect have accordingly be give by such a policy at the same time that our own treasury will be relieve from a heavy drain the mexican people will be make to feel the burden of the war and consult their own interest may be induce the more readily to require their ruler to accede to a just peace.<br > in the same message i inform congress that the amount of the loan which would be require for the further prosecution of the war might be reduce by whatever amount of expenditure can be save by military contribution collect in mexico and that the most rigorous measure for the augmentation of these contribution have be direct and a very considerable sum be expect from that source the secretary of the treasury in his annual report of that year in make his estimate of the amount of loan which would probably be require reduce the sum in consideration of the amount which would probably be derive from these contribution and congress authorize the loan upon this reduce estimate
  in the message of the 10th of february 1848 to the senate it be state that—<br > no principle be well establish than that a nation at war have the right of shift the burden off itself and impose it on the enemy by exact military contribution the mode of make such exaction must be leave to the discretion of the conqueror but it should be exercise in a manner conformable to the rule of civilized warfare.<br > the right to levy these contribution be essential to the successful prosecution of war in an enemy 's country and the practice of nation have be in accordance with this principle it be as clearly necessary as the right to fight battle and its exercise be often essential to the subsistence of the army.<br > entertain no doubt that the military right to exclude commerce altogether from the port of the enemy in our military occupation include the minor right of admit it under prescribed condition it become an important question at the date of the order whether there should be a discrimination between vessel and cargoe belong to citizen of the united states and vessel and cargoe belong to neutral nation
  in the message to the house of representatives of the 24th of july 1848 it be state that—<br > it be from the same source of authority that we derive the unquestioned right after the war have be declare by congress to blockade the port and coast of the enemy to capture his town city and province and to levy contribution upon he for the support of our army of the same character with these be the right to subject to our temporary military government the conquer territory of our enemy they be all belligerent right and their exercise be as essential to the successful prosecution of a foreign war as the right to fight battle
  by the constitution the power to declare war be vest in congress and by the same instrument it be provide that the president shall be commander in chief of the army and navy of the united states and that he shall take care that the law be faithfully execute
  when congress have exert their power by declare war against a foreign nation it be the duty of the president to prosecute it the constitution have prescribe no particular mode in which he shall perform this duty the manner of conduct the war be not define by the constitution the term war use in that instrument have a well understand meaning among nation that meaning be derive from the law of nation a code which be recognize by all civilized power as be obligatory in a state of war the power be derive from the constitution and the manner of exercise it be regulate by the law of nation when congress have declare war they in effect make it the duty of the president in prosecute it by land and sea to resort to all the mode and to exercise all the power and right which other nation at war possess he be invest with the same power in this respect as if he be personally present command our fleet by sea or our army by land he may conduct the war by issue order for fighting battle besiege and capture city conquer and hold the province of the enemy or by capture his vessel and other property on the high sea but these be not the only mode of prosecute war which be recognize by the law of nation and to which he be authorize to resort the levy of contribution on the enemy be a right of war well establish and universally acknowledge among nation and one which every belligerent possess the ability may properly exercise the most approve writer on public law admit and vindicate this right as consonant with reason justice and humanity
  no principle be well establish than that—<br > we have a fight to deprive our enemy of his possession of everything which may augment his strength and enable he to make war this everyone endeavor to accomplish in the manner most suitable to he whenever we have an opportunity we seize on the enemy 's property and convert it to our own use and thus besides diminish the enemy 's power we augment our own and obtain at least a partial indemnification or equivalent either for what constitute the subject of the war or for the expense and loss incur in its prosecution in a word we do ourselves justice
  instead of the custom of pillage the open country and defenseless place the levy of contribution have be substitute
  whoever carry on a just war have a fight to make the enemy 's country contribute to the support of his army and toward defray all the charge of the war thus he obtain a part of what be due to he and the enemy 's subject by consent to pay the sum demand have their property secure from pillage and the country be preserve
  these principle it be believe be uncontroverte by any civilized nation in modern time the public law of nation by which they be recognize have be hold by our high judicial tribunal as a code which be applicable to our situation in a state of war and bind on the united states while in admiralty and maritime case it be often the governing rule it be in a just war that a nation have the right to make the enemy 's country contribute to the support of his army not doubt that our late war with mexico be just on the part of the united states i do not hesitate when charge by the constitution with its prosecution to exercise a power common to all other nation and congress be duly inform of the mode and extent to which that power have be and would be exercise at the commencement of their first session thereafter
  upon the declaration of war against mexico by congress the united states be entitle to all the right which any other nation at war would have possess these right could only be demand and enforce by the president whose duty it be as commander in chief of the army and navy of the united states to execute the law of congress which declare the war in the act declare war congress provide for raise man and money to enable the president to prosecute it to a speedy and successful termination congress prescribe no mode of conduct it but leave the president to prosecute it accord to the law of nation as his guide indeed it would have be impracticable for congress to have provide for all the detail of a campaign
  the mode of levy contribution must necessarily be leave to the discretion of the conqueror subject to be exercise however in conformity with the law of nation it may be exercise by require a give sum or a give amount of provision to be furnish by the authority of a capture city or province it may be exercise by impose an internal tax or a tax on the enemy 's commerce whereby he may be deprive of his revenue and these may be appropriate to the use of the conqueror the latter mode be adopt by the collection of duty in the port of mexico in our military occupation during the late war with that republic
  so well establish be the military right to do this under the law of nation that our military and naval officer command our force on the theater of war adopt the same mode of levy contribution from the enemy before the order of the president of the 31st of march 1847 be issue the general in command of the army at vera cruz upon his own view of his power and duty and without specific instruction to that effect immediately after the capture of that city adopt this mode by his order of the 28th of march 1847 heretofore communicate to the house of representatives he direct a temporary and moderate tariff of duty to be establish such a tariff be establish and contribution be collect under it and apply to the use of our army at a still early period the same power be exercise by the naval officer in command of our squadron on the pacific coast not doubt the authority to resort to this mode the order of the 31st of march 1847 be issue and be in effect but a modification of the previous order of these officer by make the rate of contribution uniform and direct their collection in all the port of the enemy in our military occupation and under our temporary military government
  the right to levy contribution upon the enemy in the form of import and export duty in his port be sanction by the treaty of peace with mexico by that treaty both government recognize and confirm the exercise of that right by its provision the custom house at all the port occupy by the force of the united states be upon the exchange of ratification to be deliver up to the mexican authority together with all bond and evidence of debt for duty on importation and exportation not yet fall due and all duty on import and on export collect at such custom house or elsewhere in mexico by authority of the united states before the ratification of the treaty by the mexican government be to be retain by the united states and only the net amount of the duty collect after this period be to be deliver to the mexican government by its provision also all merchandise import previously to the restoration of the custom house to the mexican authority or export from any mexican port whilst in the occupation of the force of the united states be protect from confiscation and from the payment of any import or export duty to the mexican government even although the importation of such merchandise be prohibit by the mexican tariff the treaty also provide that should the custom house be surrender to the mexican authority in less than sixty day from the date of its signature the rate of duty on merchandise impose by the united states be in that event to survive the war until the end of this period and in the meantime mexican custom house officer be bind to levy no other duty thereon than the duty establish by the tariff find in force at such custom house at the time of the restoration of the same the tariff find in force at such custom house which be recognize and sustain by this stipulation be that establish by the military order of the 31st of march 1847 as a mode of levy and collect military contribution from the enemy
  the fight to blockade the port and coast of the enemy in war be no more provide for or prescribe by the constitution than the right to levy and collect contribution from he in the form of duty or otherwise and yet it have not be question that the president have the power after war have be declare by congress to order our navy to blockade the port and coast of mexico the right in both case exist under the law of nation if the president can not order military contribution to be collect without an act of congress for the same reason he can not order a blockade nor can he direct the enemy 's vessel to be capture on the high sea nor can he order our military and naval officer to invade the enemy 's country conquer hold and subject to our military government his city and province nor can he give to our military and naval commander order to perform many other act essential to success in war
  if when the city of mexico be capture the commander of our force have find in the mexican treasury public money which the enemy have provide to support his army can it be doubt that he possess the right to seize and appropriate it for the use of our own army if the money capture from the enemy could have be thus lawfully seize and appropriate it would have be by virtue of the law of war recognize by all civilized nation and by the same authority the source of revenue and of supply of the enemy may be cut off from he whereby he may be weaken and crippled in his mean of continue or wage the war if the commander of our force white act under the order of the president in the heart of the enemy 's country and surround by a hostile population possess none of these essential and indispensable power of war but must halt the army at every step of its progress and wait for an act of congress to be pass to authorize they to do that which every other nation have the right to do by virtue of the law of nation then indeed be the government of the united states in a condition of imbecility and weakness which must in all future time render it impossible to prosecute a foreign war in an enemy 's country successfully or to vindicate the national right and the national honor by war
  the contribution levy be collect in the enemy 's country and be order to be apply in the enemy 's country toward defray the expense of the war and the appropriation make by congress for that purpose be thus relieve and considerable balance remain undrawn from the treasury the amount of contribution remain unexpended at the close of the war as far as the account of collect and disbursing officer have be settle have be pay into the treasury in pursuance of an order for that purpose except the sum apply toward the payment of the first installment due under the treaty with mexico as state in my last annual message for which an appropriation have be make by congress the account of some of these officer as state in the report of the secretary of war accompany that message will require legislation before they can be finally settle
  in the late war with mexico it be confidently believe that the levy of contribution and the seizure of the source of public revenue upon which the enemy rely to enable he to continue the war essentially contribute to hasten peace by those mean the government and people of mexico be make to feel the pressure of the war and to realize that if it be protract its burden and inconvenience must be bear by themselves notwithstanding the great success of our arm it may well be doubt whether an honorable peace would yet have be obtain but for the very contribution which be exacted.<br>&nbsp

 the president of mexico on these explanation on the 8th day of may 1848 submit the amend treaty to the mexican congress and on the 25th of may that congress approve the treaty as amend without modification or alteration the final action of the mexican congress have take place before the commissioner of the united states have be officially receive by the mexican authority or hold any conference with they or have any other communication on the subject of the treaty except to transmit the letter of the secretary of state
 in their dispatch transmit to congress with my message of the 6th of july last communicate the treaty of peace date city of queretaro may 25 1848 9 o&#39;clock p.m. the commissioner say
 we have the satisfaction to inform you that we reach this city this afternoon at about 5 o&#39;clock and that the treaty as amend by the senate of the united states pass the mexican senate about the hour of our arrival by a vote of 33 to 5 it having previously pass the house of deputies nothing now remain but to exchange the ratification of the treaty

 we inclose a copy of our address to the president and also a copy of his reply several conference afterwards take place between messrs. rosa cuevas conto and ourselves which it be not think necessary to recapitulate as we inclose a copy of the protocol which contain the substance of the conversation we have now the satisfaction to announce that the exchange of ratification be effect to day
 this dispatch be communicate with my message of the 6th of july last and publish by order of congress
 the treaty as amend by the senate of the united states with the accompany paper and the evidence that in that form it have be ratify by mexico be receive at washington on the 4th day of july 1848 and immediately proclaim as the supreme law of the land on the 6th of july i communicate to congress the ratified treaty with such accompany document as be deem material to a full understanding of the subject to the end that congress might adopt the legislation necessary and proper to carry the treaty into effect neither the address of the commissioner nor the reply of the president of mexico on the occasion of their presentation nor the memorandum of conversation embrace in the paper call a protocol nor the correspondence now send be communicate because they be not regard as in any way material and in this i conform to the practice of our government it rarely if ever happen that all the correspondence and especially the instruction to our minister be communicate copy of these paper be now transmit as be within the resolution of the house call for all such correspondence as appertain to say treaty
 when these paper be receive at washington peace have be restore the first installment of three million pay to mexico the blockade be raise the city of mexico evacuate and our troop on their return home the war be at an end and the treaty as ratify by the united states be bind on both party and already execute in a great degree in this condition of thing it be not competent for the president alone or for the president and senate or for the president senate and house of representatives combine to abrogate the treaty to annul the peace and restore a state of war except by a solemn declaration of war
 have the protocol vary the treaty as amend by the senate of the united states it would have have no bind effect
 it be obvious that the commissioner of the united states do not regard the protocol as in any degree a part of the treaty nor as modify or alter the treaty as amend by the senate they communicate it as the substance of conversation hold after the mexican congress have ratify the treaty and they know that the approval of the mexican congress be as essential to the validity of a treaty in all its part as the advice and consent of the senate of the united states they know too that they have no authority to alter or modify the treaty in the form in which it have be ratify by the united states but that if fail to procure the ratification of the mexican government otherwise than with amendment their duty impose by express instruction be to ask of mexico to send without delay a commissioner to washington to exchange ratification here if the amendment of the treaty propose by mexico on be submit should be adopt by the senate of the united states
 i be equally well satisfied that the government of mexico have agree to the treaty as amend by the senate of the united states and do not regard the protocol as modifying enlarging or diminish its term or effect the president of that republic in submit the amend treaty to the mexican congress in his message on the 8th day of may 1848 say
 if the treaty could have be submit to your deliberation precisely as it come from the hand of the plenipotentiary my satisfaction at see the war at last bring to an end would not have be lessen as it this day be in consequence of the modification introduce into it by the senate of the united states and which have receive the sanction of the president at present it be sufficient for we to say to you that if in the opinion of the government justice have not be evince on the part of the senate and government of the united states in introduce such modification it be presume on the other hand that they be not of such importance that they should set aside the treaty i believe on the contrary that it ought to be ratify upon the same term in which it have already receive the sanction of the american government my opinion be also greatly strengthen by the fact that a new negotiation be neither expect nor consider possible much less could another be bring forward upon a basis more favorable for the republic
 the deliberation of the mexican congress with no explanation before that body from the united states except the letter of the secretary of state result in the ratification of the treaty as recommend by the president of that republic in the form in which it have be amend and ratify by the united states the conversation embody in the paper call a protocol take place after the action of the mexican congress be complete and there be no reason to suppose that the government of mexico ever submit the protocol to the congress or ever treat or regard it as in any sense a new negotiation or as operate any modification or change of the amend treaty if such have be its effect it be a nullity until approve by the mexican congress and such approval be never make or intimate to the united states in the final consummation of the ratification of the treaty by the president of mexico no reference be make to it on the contrary this ratification which be deliver to the commissioner of the united states and be now in the state department contain a full and explicit recognition of the amendment of the senate just as they have be communicate to that government by the secretary of state and be afterwards approve by the mexican congress it declare that--
 having see and examine the say treaty and the modification make by the senate of the united states of america and having give an account thereof to the general congress conformably to the requirement in the fourteenth paragraph of the one hundred and tenth article of the federal constitution of these united states that body have think proper to approve of the say treaty with the modification thereto in all their part and in consequence thereof exert the power grant to i by the constitution i accept ratify and confirm the say treaty with its modification and promise in the name of the mexican republic to fulfill and observe it and to cause it to be fulfil and observe
 upon an examination of this protocol when it be receive with the ratified treaty i do not regard it as material or as in any way attempt to modify or change the treaty as it have be amend by the senate of the united states
 the first explanation which it contain be
 that the american government by suppress the ninth article of the treaty of guadalupe and substitute the third article of the treaty of louisiana do not intend to diminish in any way what be agree upon by the aforesaid article ninth in favor of the inhabitant of the territory cede by mexico its understanding be that all of that agreement be contain in the third article of the treaty of louisiana in consequence all the privilege and guaranty civil political and religious which would have be possess by the inhabitant of the cede territory if the ninth article of the treaty have be retain will be enjoy by they without any difference under the article which have be substitute
 the ninth article of the original treaty stipulate for the incorporation of the mexican inhabitant of the cede territory and their admission into the union as soon as possible accord to the principle of the federal constitution to the enjoyment of all the right of citizen of the united states it provide also that in the meantime they should be maintain in the enjoyment of their liberty their property and their civil right now vest in they accord to the mexican law it secure to they similar political right with the inhabitant of the other territories of the united states and at least equal to the inhabitant of louisiana and florida when they be in a territorial condition it then proceed to guarantee that ecclesiastic and religious corporation should be protect in the discharge of the office of their ministry and the enjoyment of their property of every kind whether individual or corporate and finally that there should be a free communication between the catholics of the cede territory and their ecclesiastical authority even although such authority should reside within the limit of the mexican republic as define by this treaty
 the ninth article of the treaty as adopt by the senate be much more comprehensive in its term and explicit in its meaning and it clearly embrace in comparatively few word all the guaranty insert in the original article it be as follow
 mexicans who in the territory aforesaid shall not preserve the character of citizen of the mexican republic conformably with what be stipulate in the precede article shall be incorporate into the union of the united states and be admit at the proper time to be judge of by the congress of the united states to the enjoyment of all the right of citizen of the united states accord to the principle of the constitution and in the meantime shall be maintain and protect in the free enjoyment of their liberty and property and secure in the free exercise of their religion without restriction
 this article which be substantially copy from the louisiana treaty provide equally with the original article for the admission of these inhabitant into the union and in the meantime whilst they shall remain in a territorial state by one sweeping provision declare that they shall be maintain and protect in the free enjoyment of their liberty and property and secure in the free exercise of their religion without restriction
 this guaranty embrace every kind of property whether hold by ecclesiastic or layman whether belong to corporation or individual it secure to these inhabitant the free exercise of their religion without restriction whether they choose to place themselves under the spiritual authority of pastor resident within the mexican republic or the cede territory it be it be presume to place this construction beyond all question that the senate superadde the word without restriction to the religious guaranty contain in the correspond article of the louisiana treaty congress itself do not possess the power under the constitution to make any law prohibit the free exercise of religion
 if the ninth article of the treaty whether in its original or amend form have be entirely omit in the treaty all the right and privilege which either of they confer would have be secure to the inhabitant of the cede territory by the constitution and law of the united states
 the protocol assert that the american government by suppress the tenth article of the treaty of guadalupe do not in any way intend to annul the grant of land make by mexico in the ceded territory that these grant notwithstanding the suppression of the article of the treaty preserve the legal value which they may possess and the grantee may cause their legitimate title to be acknowledge before the american tribunal and then proceed to state that conformably to the law of the united states legitimate title to every description of property personal and real exist in the ceded territory be those which be legitimate title under the mexican law in california and new mexico up to the 13th of may 1846 and in texas up to the 2d of march 1836 the former be the date of the declaration of war against mexico and the latter that of the declaration of independence by texas
 the objection to the tenth article of the original treaty be not that it protect legitimate title which our law would have equally protect without it but that it most unjustly attempt to resuscitate grant which have become a mere nullity by allow the grantee the same period after the exchange of the ratification of the treaty to which they have be originally entitle after the date of their grant for the purpose of perform the condition on which they have be make in submit the treaty to the senate i have recommend the rejection of this article that portion of it in regard to land in texas do not receive a single vote in the senate this information be communicate by the letter of the secretary of state to the minister for foreign affair of mexico and be in possession of the mexican government during the whole period the treaty be before the mexican congress and the article itself be reprobate in that letter in the strong term besides our commissioner to mexico have be instruct that--
 neither the president nor the senate of the united states can ever consent to ratify any treaty contain the tenth article of the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo in favor of grantee of land in texas or elsewhere
 and again
 should the mexican government persist in retain this article then all prospect of immediate peace be end and of this you may give they an absolute assurance
 on this point the language of the protocol be free from ambiguity but if it be otherwise be there any individual american or mexican who would place such a construction upon it as to convert it into a vain attempt to revive this article which have be so often and so solemnly condemn surely no person could for one moment suppose that either the commissioner of the united states or the mexican minister for foreign affair ever entertain the purpose of thus set at naught the deliberate decision of the president and senate which have be communicate to the mexican government with the assurance that their abandonment of this obnoxious article be essential to the restoration of peace
 but the meaning of the protocol be plain it be simply that the nullification of this article be not intend to destroy valid legitimate title to land which exist and be in full force independently of the provision and without the aid of this article notwithstanding it have be expunge from the treaty these grant be to preserve the legal value which they may possess the refusal to revive grant which have become extinct be not to invalidate those which be in full force and vigor that such be the clear understanding of the senate of the united states and this in perfect accordance with the protocol be manifest from the fact that whilst they strike from the treaty this unjust article they at the same time sanction and ratify the last paragraph of the eighth article of the treaty which declare that--
 in the say territory property of every kind now belong to mexicans not establish there shall be inviolably respect the present owner the heir of these and all mexicans who may hereafter acquire say property by contract shall enjoy with respect to it guaranty equally ample as if the same belong to citizen of the united states
 without any stipulation in the treaty to this effect all such valid title under the mexican government would have be protect under the constitution and law of the united states
 the third and last explanation contain in the protocol be that--
 the government of the united states by suppress the conclude paragraph of article 12 of the treaty do not intend to deprive the mexican republic of the free and unrestrained faculty of ceding conveying or transfer at any time as it may judge well the sum of the $ 12,000,000 which the same government of the united states be to deliver in the place designate by the amend article
 the conclude paragraph of the original twelfth article thus suppress by the senate be in the following language
 certificate in proper form for the said installment respectively in such sum as shall be desire by the mexican government and transferable by it shall be deliver to the say government by that of the united states
 from this bare statement of fact the meaning of the protocol be obvious although the senate have decline to create a government stock for the $ 12,000,000 and issue transferable certificate for the amount in such sum as the mexican government might desire yet they could not have intend thereby to deprive that government of the faculty which every creditor possess of transfer for his own benefit the obligation of his debtor whatever this may be worth accord to his will and pleasure
 it can not be doubt that the twelfth article of the treaty as it now stand contain a positive obligation in consideration of the extension acquire by the boundary of the united states to pay to the mexican republic $ 12,000,000 in four equal annual installment of three million each this obligation may be assign by the mexican government to any person whatever but the assignee in such case would stand in no well condition than the government the amendment of the senate prohibit the issue of a government transferable stock for the amount produce this effect and no more
 the protocol contain nothing from which it can be infer that the assignee could rightfully demand the payment of the money in case the consideration should fail which be state on the face of the obligation
 with this view of the whole protocol and consider that the explanation which it contain be in accordance with the treaty i do not deem it necessary to take any action upon the subject have it varied from the term of the treaty as amend by the senate although it would even then have be a nullity in itself yet duty might have require that i should make this fact know to the mexican government this not be the case i treat it in the same manner i would have do have these explanation be make verbally by the commissioner to the mexican minister for foreign affair and communicate in a dispatch to the state department

elect by the american people to the high office know to our law i appear here to take the oath prescribe by the constitution and in compliance with a time honor custom to address those who be now assemble

 the confidence and respect show by my countryman in call i to be the chief magistrate of a republic hold a high rank among the nation of the earth have inspire i with feeling of the most profound gratitude but when i reflect that the acceptance of the office which their partiality have bestow impose the discharge of the most arduous duty and involve the weighty obligation i be conscious that the position which i have be call to fill though sufficient to satisfy the lofty ambition be surround by fearful responsibility happily however in the performance of my new duty i shall not be without able cooperation the legislative and judicial branch of the government present prominent example of distinguished civil attainment and matured experience and it shall be my endeavor to call to my assistance in the executive departments individual whose talent integrity and purity of character will furnish ample guaranty for the faithful and honorable performance of the trust to be commit to their charge with such aid and an honest purpose to do whatever be right i hope to execute diligently impartially and for the good interest of the country the manifold duty devolve upon i

 in the discharge of these duty my guide will be the constitution which i this day swear to preserve protect and defend for the interpretation of that instrument i shall look to the decision of the judicial tribunal establish by its authority and to the practice of the government under the early president who have so large a share in its formation to the example of those illustrious patriot i shall always defer with reverence and especially to his example who be by so many title the father of his country

 to command the army and navy of the united states with the advice and consent of the senate to make treaty and to appoint ambassador and other officer to give to congress information of the state of the union and recommend such measure as he shall judge to be necessary and to take care that the law shall be faithfully execute these be the most important function entrust to the president by the constitution and it may be expect that i shall briefly indicate the principle which will control i in their execution

 choose by the body of the people under the assurance that my administration would be devoted to the welfare of the whole country and not to the support of any particular section or merely local interest i this day renew the declaration i have heretofore make and proclaim my fix determination to maintain to the extent of my ability the government in its original purity and to adopt as the basis of my public policy those great republican doctrine which constitute the strength of our national existence

 in reference to the army and navy lately employ with so much distinction on active service care shall be take to insure the high condition of efficiency and in furtherance of that object the military and naval school sustain by the liberality of congress shall receive the special attention of the executive

 as american freeman we can not but sympathize in all effort to extend the blessing of civil and political liberty but at the same time we be warn by the admonition of history and the voice of our own beloved washington to abstain from entangle alliance with foreign nation in all dispute between conflict government it be our interest not less than our duty to remain strictly neutral while our geographical position the genius of our institution and our people the advance spirit of civilization and above all the dictate of religion direct we to the cultivation of peaceful and friendly relation with all other power it be to be hope that no international question can now arise which a government confident in its own strength and resolve to protect its own just right may not settle by wise negotiation and it eminently become a government like our own found on the morality and intelligence of its citizen and uphold by their affection to exhaust every resort of honorable diplomacy before appeal to arm in the conduct of our foreign relation i shall conform to these view as i believe they essential to the good interest and the true honor of the country

 the appoint power vest in the president impose delicate and onerous duty so far as it be possible to be inform i shall make honesty capacity and fidelity indispensable prerequisite to the bestowal of office and the absence of either of these quality shall be deem sufficient cause for removal

 it shall be my study to recommend such constitutional measure to congress as may be necessary and proper to secure encouragement and protection to the great interest of agriculture commerce and manufacture to improve our river and harbor to provide for the speedy extinguishment of the public debt to enforce a strict accountability on the part of all officer of the government and the utmost economy in all public expenditure but it be for the wisdom of congress itself in which all legislative power be vest by the constitution to regulate these and other matter of domestic policy i shall look with confidence to the enlightened patriotism of that body to adopt such measure of conciliation as may harmonize conflicting interest and tend to perpetuate that union which should be the paramount object of our hope and affection in any action calculate to promote an object so near the heart of everyone who truly love his country i will zealously unite with the coordinate branch of the government

 in conclusion i congratulate you my fellow citizen upon the high state of prosperity to which the goodness of divine providence have conduct our common country let we invoke a continuance of the same protect care which have lead we from small beginning to the eminence we this day occupy and let we seek to deserve that continuance by prudence and moderation in our council by well direct attempt to assuage the bitterness which too often mark unavoidable difference of opinion by the promulgation and practice of just and liberal principle and by an enlarged patriotism which shall acknowledge no limit but those of our own widespread republic

 the extension of the coast of the united states on the pacific and the unexampled rapidity with which the inhabitant of california especially be increase in number have impart new consequence to our relation with the other country whose territory border upon that ocean it be probable that the intercourse between those country and our possession in that quarter particularly with the republic of chili will become extensive and mutually advantageous in proportion as california and oregon shall increase in population and wealth it be desirable therefore that this government should do everything in its power to foster and strengthen its relation with those states and that the spirit of amity between we should be mutual and cordial
 i recommend the observance of the same course toward all other american states the united states stand as the great american power to which as their natural ally and friend they will always be dispose first to look for mediation and assistance in the event of any collision between they and any european nation as such we may often kindly mediate in their behalf without entangle ourselves in foreign war or unnecessary controversy whenever the faith of our treaty with any of they shall require our interference we must necessarily interpose

 a contract having be conclude with the state of nicaragua by a company compose of american citizen for the purpose of construct a ship canal through the territory of that state to connect the atlantic and pacific ocean i have direct the negotiation of a treaty with nicaragua pledge both government to protect those who shall engage in and perfect the work all other nation be invite by the state of nicaragua to enter into the same treaty stipulation with she and the benefit to be derive by each from such an arrangement will be the protection of this great interoceanic communication against any power which might seek to obstruct it or to monopolize its advantage all states enter into such a treaty will enjoy the right of passage through the canal on payment of the same toll the work if construct under these guaranty will become a bond of peace instead of a subject of contention and strife between the nation of the earth should the great maritime states of europe consent to this arrangement and we have no reason to suppose that a proposition so fair and honorable will be oppose by any the energy of their people and our will cooperate in promote the success of the enterprise i do not recommend any appropriation from the national treasury for this purpose nor do i believe that such an appropriation be necessary private enterprise if properly protect will complete the work should it prove to be feasible the party who have procure the charter from nicaragua for its construction desire no assistance from this government beyond its protection and they profess that having examine the propose line of communication they will be ready to commence the undertaking whenever that protection shall be extend to they should there appear to be reason on examine the whole evidence to entertain a serious doubt of the practicability of construct such a canal that doubt could be speedily solve by an actual exploration of the route
 should such a work be construct under the common protection of all nation for equal benefit to all it would be neither just nor expedient that any great maritime state should command the communication the territory through which the canal may be open ought to be free from the claim of any foreign power no such power should occupy a position that would enable it hereafter to exercise so control an influence over the commerce of the world or to obstruct a highway which ought to be dedicate to the common use of mankind
 the route across the isthmus at tehuantepec and panama be also worthy of our serious consideration they do not fail to engage the attention of my predecessor the negotiator of the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo be instruct to offer a very large sum of money for the right of transit across the isthmus of tehuantepec the mexican government do not accede to the proposition for the purchase of the right of way probably because it have already contract with private individual for the construction of a passage from the guasacualco river to tehuantepec i shall not renew any proposition to purchase for money a right which ought to be equally secure to all nation on payment of a reasonable toll to the owner of the improvement who would doubtless be well content with that compensation and the guaranty of the maritime state of the world in separate treaty negotiate with mexico bind she and they to protect those who should construct the work such guaranty would do more to secure the completion of the communication through the territory of mexico than any other reasonable consideration that could be offer and as mexico herself would be the great gainer by the opening of this communication between the gulf and the pacific ocean it be presume that she would not hesitate to yield her aid in the manner propose to accomplish an improvement so important to her own good interest
 we have reason to hope that the propose railroad across the isthmus at panama will be successfully construct under the protection of the late treaty with new granada ratify and exchange by my predecessor on the 10th day of june 1848 which guarantee the perfect neutrality of the isthmus and the right of sovereignty and property of new granada over that territory with a view that the free transit from ocean to ocean may not be interrupt or embarrassed during the existence of the treaty it be our policy to encourage every practicable route across the isthmus which connect north and south america either by railroad or canal which the energy and enterprise of our citizen may induce they to complete and i consider it obligatory upon i to adopt that policy especially in consequence of the absolute necessity of facilitate intercourse with our possession on the pacific
 the position of the sandwich islands with reference to the territory of the united states on the pacific the success of our persevering and benevolent citizen who have repair to that remote quarter in christianize the native and induce they to adopt a system of government and law suit to their capacity and want and the use make by our numerous whale ship of the harbor of the island as place of resort for obtain refreshment and repair all combine to render their destiny peculiarly interesting to we it be our duty to encourage the authority of those island in their effort to improve and elevate the moral and political condition of the inhabitant and we should make reasonable allowance for the difficulty inseparable from this task we desire that the island may maintain their independence and that other nation should concur with we in this sentiment we could in no event be indifferent to their passing under the dominion of any other power the principal commercial state have in this a common interest and it be to be hope that no one of they will attempt to interpose obstacle to the entire independence of the island
 the receipt into the treasury for the fiscal year end on the 30th of june last be in cash $ 48,830,097.50 and in treasury note fund $ 10,833,000 make an aggregate of $ 59,663,097.50 and the expenditure for the same time be in cash $ 46,798,667.82 and in treasury note fund $ 10,833,000 make an aggregate of $ 57,631,667.82
 the account and estimate which will be submit to congress in the report of the secretary of the treasury show that there will probably be a deficit occasion by the expense of the mexican war and treaty on the 1st day of july next of $ 5,828,121.66 and on the 1st day of july 1851 of $ 10,547,092.73 make in the whole a probable deficit to be provide for of $ 16,375,214.39 the extraordinary expense of the war with mexico and the purchase of california and new mexico exceed in amount this deficit together with the loan heretofore make for those object i therefore recommend that authority be give to borrow what ever sum may be necessary to cover that deficit i recommend the observance of strict economy in the appropriation and expenditure of public money
 i recommend a revision of the exist tariff and its adjustment on a basis which may augment the revenue i do not doubt the right or duty of congress to encourage domestic industry which be the great source of national as well as individual wealth and prosperity i look to the wisdom and patriotism of congress for the adoption of a system which may place home labor at last on a sure and permanent footing and by due encouragement of manufacture give a new and increase stimulus to agriculture and promote the development of our vast resource and the extension of our commerce believe that to the attainment of these end as well as the necessary augmentation of the revenue and the prevention of fraud a system of specific duty be well adapt i strongly recommend to congress the adoption of that system fix the duty at rate high enough to afford substantial and sufficient encouragement to our own industry and at the same time so adjust as to insure stability

 no direct aid have be give by the general government to the improvement of agriculture except by the expenditure of small sum for the collection and publication of agricultural statistic and for some chemical analysis which have be thus far pay for out of the patent fund this aid be in my opinion wholly inadequate to give to this lead branch of american industry the encouragement which it merit i respectfully recommend the establishment of an agricultural bureau to be connect with the department of the interior to elevate the social condition of the agriculturist to increase his prosperity and to extend his mean of usefulness to his country by multiply his source of information should be the study of every statesman and a primary object with every legislator
 no civil government having be provide by congress for california the people of that territory impel by the necessity of their political condition recently meet in convention for the purpose of form a constitution and state government which the late advice give i reason to suppose have be accomplish and it be believe they will shortly apply for the admission of california into the union as a sovereign state should such be the case and should their constitution be conformable to the requisition of the constitution of the united states i recommend their application to the favorable consideration of congress the people of new mexico will also it be believe at no very distant period present themselves for admission into the union preparatory to the admission of california and new mexico the people of each will have institute for themselves a republican form of government lay its foundation in such principle and organize its power in such form as to they shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness by await their action all cause of uneasiness may be avoid and confidence and kind feeling preserve with a view of maintain the harmony and tranquillity so dear to all we should abstain from the introduction of those exciting topic of a sectional character which have hitherto produce painful apprehension in the public mind and i repeat the solemn warning of the first and most illustrious of my predecessor against furnish any ground for characterize party by geographical discrimination
 a collector have be appoint at san francisco under the act of congress extend the revenue law over california and measure have be take to organize the custom house at that and the other port mention in that act at the early period practicable the collector proceed overland and advice have not yet be receive of his arrival at san francisco meanwhile it be understand that the custom have continue to be collect there by officer act under the military authority as they be during the administration of my predecessor it will i think be expedient to confirm the collection thus make and direct the avail after such allowance as congress may think fit to authorize to be expend within the territory or to be pay into the treasury for the purpose of meet appropriation for the improvement of its river and harbor
 a party engage on the coast survey be dispatch to oregon in january last accord to the late advice they have not leave california and direction have be give to they as soon as they shall have fix on the site of the two light house and the buoy authorize to be construct and place in oregon to proceed without delay to make reconnaissance of the most important point on the coast of california and especially to examine and determine on site for light house on that coast the speedy erection of which be urgently demand by our rapidly increase commerce
 i have transfer the indian agency from upper missouri and council bluffs to santa fe and salt lake and have cause to be appoint subagent in the valley of the gila the sacramento and the san joaquin river still further legal provision will be necessary for the effective and successful extension of our system of indian intercourse over the new territory
 i recommend the establishment of a branch mint in california as it will in my opinion afford important facility to those engage in mining as well as to the government in the disposition of the mineral land
 i also recommend that commission be organize by congress to examine and decide upon the validity of the present subsist land title in california and new mexico and that provision be make for the establishment of office of surveyor general in new mexico california and oregon and for the surveying and bring into market the public land in those territories those land remote in position and difficult of access ought to be dispose of on term liberal to all but especially favorable to the early emigrant
 in order that the situation and character of the principal mineral deposit in california may be ascertain i recommend that a geological and mineralogical exploration be connect with the linear survey and that the mineral land be divide into small lot suitable for mining and be dispose of by sale or lease so as to give our citizen an opportunity of procure a permanent right of property in the soil this would seem to be as important to the success of mining as of agricultural pursuit
 the great mineral wealth of california and the advantage which its port and harbor and those of oregon afford to commerce especially with the island of the pacific and indian ocean and the populous region of eastern asia make it certain that there will arise in a few year large and prosperous community on our western coast it therefore become important that a line of communication the good and most expeditious which the nature of the country will admit should be open within the territory of the united states from the navigable water of the atlantic or the gulf of mexico to the pacific opinion as elicit and express by two large and respectable convention lately assemble at st. louis and memphis point to a railroad as that which if practicable will well meet the wish and want of the country but while this if in successful operation would be a work of great national importance and of a value to the country which it would be difficult to estimate it ought also to be regard as an undertaking of vast magnitude and expense and one which must if it be indeed practicable encounter many difficulty in its construction and use therefore to avoid failure and disappointment to enable congress to judge whether in the condition of the country through which it must pass the work be feasible and if it be find so whether it should be undertake as a national improvement or leave to individual enterprise and in the latter alternative what aid if any ought to be extend to it by the government i recommend as a preliminary measure a careful reconnaissance of the several propose route by a scientific corps and a report as to the practicability of make such a road with an estimate of the cost of its construction and support
 for further view on these and other matter connect with the duty of the home department i refer you to the report of the secretary of the interior

 great embarrassment have result from the effect upon rank in the army heretofore give to brevet and staff commission the view of the secretary of war on this subject be deem important and if carry into effect will it be believe promote the harmony of the service the plan propose for retire disabled officer and provide an asylum for such of the rank and file as from age wound and other infirmity occasion by service have become unfit to perform their respective duty be recommend as a means of increase the efficiency of the army and as an act of justice due from a grateful country to the faithful soldier

 i invite your attention to the recommendation of the secretary of the navy on the subject of a reorganization of the navy in its various grade of officer and the establishing of a retire list for such of the officer as be disqualify for active and effective service should congress adopt some such measure as be recommend it will greatly increase the efficiency of the navy and reduce its expenditure

 it be submit to the wisdom of congress whether a further reduction of postage should not now be make more particularly on the letter correspondence this should be relieve from the unjust burden of transport and deliver the franked matter of congress for which public service provision should be make from the treasury i confidently believe that a change may safely be make reduce all single letter postage to the uniform rate of 5 cent regardless of distance without thereby impose any great tax on the treasury than would constitute a very moderate compensation for this public service and i therefore respectfully recommend such a reduction should congress prefer to abolish the franking privilege entirely it seem probable that no demand on the treasury would result from the propose reduction of postage whether any further diminution should now be make or the result of the reduction to 5 cent which i have recommend should be first test be submit to your decision
